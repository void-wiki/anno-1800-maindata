          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It's what the locals know as 'ourare'.&lt;/b&gt; Accounts of the region frequently reference it as a lethal coating for arrowheads, or in this case, blowpipe darts. A treatment is also mentionedâ€” a form of mouth-to-mouth in which the resuscitator acts as iron lung to the patient. And it works! There is no childish awkwardness, with an excess volunteering to save their fellows. The victims of the poison are saved, and all emerge from those (often dark) hours with a new feeling of togetherness.</Text>
