          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Their aim is embarassing.&lt;/b&gt; Your lead rolls around the solid iron deck like balls of ivory on a bagatelle board, barely making a dent. You have given your position away, and the iron dragon's mouth yawns wide above your little boat, and from it the first plume of fire melts the men at the taffrail.

You can try to target the flaming cannon, or try to outrun them before the dragon's breath replenishes once more.</Text>
