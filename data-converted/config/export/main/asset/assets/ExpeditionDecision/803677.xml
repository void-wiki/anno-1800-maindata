          <Text>Instead of helping the poor boy, &lt;b&gt;your clergyman gets carried away&lt;/b&gt; with his proselytising. Being ignorant of the boy's exact affliction, he falls fearfully back to the age-old redoubt of the cleric; that all around them are wicked heathens. It takes several strong soldiers to drag him away, and &lt;b&gt;your expedition leaves feeling it may have tarnished Her Majesty's reputation.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
