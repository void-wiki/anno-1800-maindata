          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your infiltrator has the place to themself.&lt;/b&gt; The study is small and spartan, an occasional home for some absent overseer perhaps. As such you would think the most likely place for important documents, but &lt;b&gt;of that contract there is no sign!&lt;/b&gt; Riffling through the drawers however, does produce an antique &lt;b&gt;gold coin&lt;/b&gt; May as well pocket it, before moving on.</Text>
