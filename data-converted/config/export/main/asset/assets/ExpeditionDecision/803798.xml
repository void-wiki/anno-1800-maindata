          <Text>"Look at you, a pack of rats standing for each others. But I am certain you do not want to all be punished for the actions of only one of you. I am going to count until 10. If at 10 I don't have the name of a culprit, then I will withdraw the food for all of you!" The diplomat was barely at 2 when the sailors start to accuse each others dispraisingly.
