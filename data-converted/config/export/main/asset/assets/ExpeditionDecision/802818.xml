          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Who would accept such a meager payment?&lt;/b&gt; Murder is not a subject to be triffled with and the foreign court makes its opinion clear: your crew will pay in the hardest way possible. To show that they value life more than your sailors, the judges impose a non-lethal punishment and insist on this point, devising a program of forced labour and precise observation to make sure the sailors suffer as much as possible without dying. Months of hell follow before the crew can leave.</Text>
