          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The rescue team also faces the trials of the glacier.&lt;/b&gt; Of the two scouts sent, only one comes back, and with him a team of sailors frozen by their numerous detours and hours spent getting lost in the mountain. The pulley they bring is the perfect solution for rescuing the fallen men. The wounded are many, both among the victims and their rescuers, yet none complains: they are alive, if missing a limb or two.</Text>
