          <Text>&lt;b&gt;They make the island seem a barren hell,&lt;/b&gt; their desperate thirst for meat finding no quarry. Repairs to the hull seem inconsequential when people start dropping like flies. But if hunger is the devil, those fallen bodies are the deal: best eaten while they're still fresh. The ship may be recovered, but these men will never be the same again.</Text>
