          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The stalactites are dealt with.&lt;/b&gt; In a bold act of defiance towards logic and prudence, your artillery men fire the cannons to send precisely gauged vibrations through your ship. The foremast protests but resists while the pikes of ice parasitising its sails break and rain on the deck in a cacophony of tingling sounds. Your maimed ship has but to wait for the blizzard to run out of breath now.</Text>
