          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a foul night in the rain.&lt;/b&gt; There is minimal shelter from the elements within these smooth and featureless walls, and the rising moan of the gale is unbearable. Finally at dawn, the storm relents. At about half past the hour of ten, the castle door swings open, and a friendly-faced man emerges from it. "What in blazes!" he laughs, "what are all you fellows doing out here!" He explains that he is the heir to this castle, which he claims survived a siege in 1422, and that the portcullis is a rather sensitive beast these days. Your men are pretty peeved, not to mention a little feverish, at the thought they could have spent the night in a comfortable four-poster bed.   </Text>
