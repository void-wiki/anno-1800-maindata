          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your soldiers lack initiative&lt;/b&gt;, and it is the Pyrphorians who swing aboard your ship, brandishing torches and firing elegant pocket pistols. Though their zeal cannot be matched, they are outnumbered. By the time they are subdued, they have pinned two, and burned many others. The accomplices in their boat are already halfway to Montoya. Once your groaning survivors have been gauzed-up, you might still find them there. </Text>
