          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The design of the gunboat is vital to your success.&lt;/b&gt; Being of moderate size, and yet possessing the manoeuvering capabilities of a much smaller ship, the gunboat is able to navigate the awkward river shallows with ease. Mr. Cardinale is delighted that you have delivered him to the site of his proposed Opera House, and promises to talk favourably of each and every man when he returns to civilisation. </Text>
