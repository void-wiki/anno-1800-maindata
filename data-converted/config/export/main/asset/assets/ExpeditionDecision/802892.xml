          <Text>&lt;b&gt;They are not discreet enough,&lt;/b&gt; some fool still has their lantern lit! Your position is given away, and the iron dragon suddenly changes course, its mouth yawning wide above your little boat, and from it the first plume of fire melts the men at the taffrail. The two hulls are close enough for boarding, but there are just too many of the rogues. You can try to target the flaming cannon, or try to outrun them before the dragon's breath replenishes once more.</Text>
