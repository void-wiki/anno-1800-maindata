          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The ominous black spikes that covered the tree's trunk were far from the only danger it posed to the crew.&lt;/b&gt; As they were carefully circling around it, a loud bang was heard and a man was sent to the floor with a painful yell. One of the tree's fist-sized wooden fruits had exploded, sending surprisingly sharp splinters into the man's right flank. Moving him could be fatal, but the shade of a tree that drops grenades is not the safest place to perform a surgery.</Text>
