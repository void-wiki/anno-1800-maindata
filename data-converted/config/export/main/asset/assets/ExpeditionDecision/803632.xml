          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Despite his wounds, adrenaline steadies the doctor's hand. &lt;/b&gt; Aided by two members of the crew, he decides to perform a laparotomy and open the patient's abdomen up. It is a gruesome, painful procedure that curdles the blood of everyone present, but the shards are successfully removed. Once the surgery is finished, half the crew is covered in blood and viscera, but both men can be safely taken back to the ship for recovery.</Text>
