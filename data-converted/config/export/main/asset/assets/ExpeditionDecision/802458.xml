          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your expedition leaves both hungry and several men lighter. &lt;/b&gt; Not only have your men descrated the feast in honour of the spirit of cassava, they remain unapologetic, poking and prodding the different dishes as if the villagers weren't even there. When one man takes a carved ritual spoon and starts digging in, smiling as he does so, he seems surprised when a villager shoots him. A brief exchange of gunfire follows, before your men flee to avoid taking further losses.</Text>
