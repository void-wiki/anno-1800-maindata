          <Text>After inspecting the kitchen carefully, the detective finds no evidence of guilt. "Maybe we should analyze the whole chain, not simply the last link". He opens the storage and among the amount of perfectly good supply, he notices that the porridge's cereals have a strange smell. Inspecting closer, opening a seed, he notices tiny worms going out of it. "The food was not poisoned, the supplies went bad. The only blame we could give her is for negligence but certainly not murder." The crew is relieved to learn nobody acted malevolently. The cook and his assistant spend hours sorting the wheat from the chaff but it's a small concession for everybody safety.</Text>
