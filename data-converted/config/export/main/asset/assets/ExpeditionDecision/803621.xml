          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A miracle!&lt;/b&gt; The priestess sinks the cursed crew members in a forest pool and blesses their foreheads with the symbol of the cross. "Exsúrgat Deus et dissipéntur inimíci ejus", she recites, and the men and women exhale a sigh of relief, as the burning fades away. Although they will have to live with the devil's taint on their skin for the rest of their days, each and every single one of them feels thankful and blessed.</Text>
