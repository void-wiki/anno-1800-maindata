          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Each word that blurts out of your first mate's mouth makes the man fret more violently.&lt;/b&gt; Each crew member watches, helpless and distraught, as the agonising officer's lips turn purple, then blue, while the first mate continues to screech at him to "just calm down and breathe in". The look of panic in the man's eyes pierces the souls of every man and woman present just before falling unconscious. Nothing can be done for him.</Text>
