          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Few have any experience of caving.&lt;/b&gt; The route they take is clammy and claustrophobic, and seems to be leading nowhere, when there is a sudden and awful screeching of bats! A man loses his footing and falls through a gapâ€” he has broken a leg. His rescue is especially tiresome. It takes several hours in the confined space, which he fills with his moans whenever anyone so much as touches the injured leg. &lt;b&gt;You are forced to abandon your search for El Doodah.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
