          <Text>&lt;b&gt;"Your helmsmanship is most impressive!"&lt;/b&gt; the Queen calls down to you, as you bring the modest sailing ship you have borrowed neatly alongside her flagship.&lt;b&gt;"Meet me tomorrow at the Cape of Trelawney!"&lt;/b&gt; You find your own ship at the marina, and sail to Trelawney, southernmost point of the Old World. It was not fifteen years previous, that a great naval victory was won here over La Corona by one Admiral Nadasky.The Lap of Victory is there waiting for you, and the Queen receives you warmly aboard. &lt;b&gt;You are finally able to ask why it is she has run away.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
