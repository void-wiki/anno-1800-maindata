          <Text>&lt;b&gt;"Absurd magic, but it works!"&lt;/b&gt; say officers sent to the inland village for help. Having described the beast, they were referred to a witch. She encouraged them to ingest live scorpions, one of each colour; yellow, red and black. This they did reluctantly, but found when they confronted the animal, it took flight. All promptly follow the witch's advice, and sure enough, remain undisturbed for the remainder of the resupply.    </Text>
