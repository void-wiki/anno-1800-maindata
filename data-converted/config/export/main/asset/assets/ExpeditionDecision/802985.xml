          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Communication is appalling.&lt;/b&gt; The abseil down is messy, but fortune prevails. Not so on the way back up, when a poor sailor's knot slips, and the jangle of guy ropes sends one of the frontrunning climbers plunging into the shallow creek. "He's gone. Don't look!" cries Ram√≥n. Sir Archibald's man is wise indeed, for the rest manage the climb. Resuming their trek, morale is low until someone spots a human bootprint on the forest floor. Perhaps these lead right to Isabel Sarmento? But that would mean deviating from the route on the map, and it the day is beginning to grow dark.  </Text>
