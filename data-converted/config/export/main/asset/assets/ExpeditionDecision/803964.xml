          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sharp-eared watchman keeps vigil.&lt;/b&gt; In the small dark of Arctic summer, he catches the scratch of a bear's unretractable claws on ice. It is trying to approach discretely but the watchman is ready. At the sound of his gun the rest wake with a jolt, only to find a big dead bear at his feet. &lt;b&gt;They celebrate their trophy, and are soon back en route to Ivujivik.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
