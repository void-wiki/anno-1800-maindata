          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Worried about noise, your crew don't load fast enough.&lt;/b&gt; One good hit from the shadows would done the trick, but it is too late now, your position is given away. As it approaches, the iron dragon's mouth yawns wide above your little boat, and from it the first plume of fire melts the men at the taffrail. The two hulls are close enough for boarding, but there are just too many of the rogues. You can try to target the flaming cannon, or perhaps trick them into following you to the shallows.</Text>
