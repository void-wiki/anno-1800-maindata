          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It would be easier to build a new boat,&lt;/b&gt; is the verdict of your carpenters, though they spend hours trying to find the right wood to help with the repairs. The black wood they select is extremely hard to cut, and heavy to carry. All the while they have the feeling they are being watched. Exhausted with the lack of progress, they are reclining on a sandy stretch of the river bank when they hear a clicking sound. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
