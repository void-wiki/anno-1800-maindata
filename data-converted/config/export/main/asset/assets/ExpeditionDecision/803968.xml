          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Hands trembling with fear,&lt;/b&gt; the men grab for their rifles, but mama bear smells their nerves and is upon them. Finally someone gets a shot away and though it misses, it scares her momentarily. Her white coat is lank with the blood of several men. Those still standing flee. The Inuit are startled when your party &lt;b&gt;arrive at Ivujivik the next afternoon looking especially bedraggled.&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
