          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your frail discipline falls apart.&lt;/b&gt; One of your officers and a handful of escorting sailors order the starved men to ration the meat lest they suffer from even more famine while your ship goes to look for help. Their lack of presence and conviction has no impact on the sailors, who throw themselves on the supplies and transform into beasts, frail animals who lack the strength to rip each other apart despite their will to do so. Your ship leaves in a hurry, leaving the fools to their madness.</Text>
