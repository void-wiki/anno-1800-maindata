          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The locals are willing to provide help and materials.&lt;/b&gt; While it takes the crew time to incorporate the materials into their winch design, the locals are happy to wait. Good relations make the feat of hoisting a ship over a hill less painful than it might have been. The boat finally clatters down into the water of the upper river. All are most grateful to the locals, without whom none of this would have been possible.</Text>
