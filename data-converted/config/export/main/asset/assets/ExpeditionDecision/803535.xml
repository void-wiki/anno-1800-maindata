          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Ahh...the intemperance of addiction.&lt;/b&gt; Although they soon grow accustomed to the devilish hallucinations, your men now develop a profane appetite for the pleasures of the flower â€” slumber's holy balm. Procrastination, and apathy towards the supposedly 'materialistic objectives' of the expedition are the products of these indulgences.
