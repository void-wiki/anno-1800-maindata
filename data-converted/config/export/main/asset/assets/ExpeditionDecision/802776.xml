          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Should have waved the white flag sooner.&lt;/b&gt; Your weapons drop and the pirate captain saunters aboard. She is tall and surprisingly aged, dressed in the dashing clothes of a bygone era, "For our trouble, we'll have some of yer crew for slaves," she growls, "all of 'em left of this line."
