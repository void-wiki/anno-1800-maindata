          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your assault is swift and without a single casualty.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers oppose no resistance when their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout, a sweatshop with no other employees than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exulting parents: they give no rewards but smiles and tears, and your crew basks in this priceless payment.</Text>
