          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The warriors take great offence.&lt;/b&gt; One of them spits on the jacket of an officer, who moves to draw his weapon, but they are too fast. The lithe women dive and roll and thrust their lances. All the men of your small scouting party are killed. The women are spared however, the warriors giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   </Text>
