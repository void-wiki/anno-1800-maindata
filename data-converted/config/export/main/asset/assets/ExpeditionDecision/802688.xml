          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The fugitive dies,&lt;/b&gt; along with his pursuers. When your men try to lay hands on the port officials, they put a pistol to the fugitive's head. "Try to stop us and he gets it," they say. When your men try to be clever, they blow the fugitive's head off, then blow the head off one of your men, before they themselves can be subdued. The dead prisoner was very popular aboard ship, and your crew wonder if things could possibly have turned out worse.</Text>
