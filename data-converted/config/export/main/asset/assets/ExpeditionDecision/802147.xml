          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.&lt;/b&gt; The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate and they lose the bandits. They stumble upon both less and more than what they expected: a pit filled with torn shoes and their torn makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.</Text>
