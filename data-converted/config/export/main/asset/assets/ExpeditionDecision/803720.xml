          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A tragedy!&lt;/b&gt; Each armed crew member draws their pistol and unleashes a hail of pellets upon the beast. Not only is the reckless manoeuvre utterly ineffective against the monster's bulletproof scales; your petrified navigator is caught between the beast and the open fire. With nowhere to run, she falls an easy prey to the gator. It shakes her tiny body around in its jaws like a puppet and pulls her down to the cloudy water, never to be seen again.</Text>
