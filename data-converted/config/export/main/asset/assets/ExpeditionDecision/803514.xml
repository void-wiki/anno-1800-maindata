          <Text>&lt;b&gt;"A limp effort!"&lt;/b&gt; the Queen bellows over to you, as you struggle to bring your ship alongside the gigantic flagship. You would never have caught her had she not taken pity on you and slowed down.&lt;b&gt;"You'd better meet me at the Cape of Trelawney, if indeed, you are capable!"&lt;/b&gt; Slightly hurt, you point your ship towards Trelawney, southernmost point of the Old World, where not fifteen years previous, a great naval victory was won over La Corona by the heroic Admiral Nadasky. The Lap of Victory is there waiting for you, and the Queen receives you rather icily aboard. With a gulp, &lt;b&gt;you are finally able to ask why it is she has run away.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
