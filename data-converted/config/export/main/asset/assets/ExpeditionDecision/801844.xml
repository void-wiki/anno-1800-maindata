Hannah will be delighted, with this in your possession, a war may be prevented, and the small trouble it has taken to obtain, be proven worthwhile. Indeed there is a further windfall, at the end of the hall, a curious &lt;b&gt;fossil&lt;/b&gt; atop a pedestal. You may as well have the men carry it with you as you leave.</Text>
