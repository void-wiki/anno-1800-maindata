          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigator can gather no speed,&lt;/b&gt; which is hardly surprising, since there seems little wind on the river today. As a result of his attempts to catch the merest breeze, the line of approach is also poor, and two of the craggiest protuberances of rock make themselves known. There is a sharp splintering as your poor ship's hull suffers what it was never built for, riding up and over the tiered association of white water pools. Your damaged hull begins to flood, and though you see the Iron Dragon turn tail and puff downstream, you must now decide whether to &lt;b&gt;fix or forsake your ship.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
