          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The chapel miraculously stands its ground.&lt;/b&gt; Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nested on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.</Text>
