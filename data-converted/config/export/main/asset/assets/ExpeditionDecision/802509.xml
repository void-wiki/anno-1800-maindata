          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Safe and sound.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the battering rain and navigating the pitching deck with skill, the sailors organize a human chain to store all upper decks goods in the depths of the ship. The temporary ballast, accompanied by the human weight of the sailors, manages to lower the waterline and quells the ship's rolls. Hidden in the hull and unable to do anymore for their ship, the crew must wait for the storm to calm down on its own.</Text>
