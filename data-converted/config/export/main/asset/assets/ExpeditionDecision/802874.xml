          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The dragon incinerates most of your ship,&lt;/b&gt; and only by complete chance does one cannot shot land clean causing the great beast's engines begin to splutter. As your crew make a desperate escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemyâ€” to see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that very nearly was their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they bury the dead and begin the extensive repairs to the ship.</Text>
