          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A man's finger for a stowaway weasel!&lt;/b&gt; In good faith, a pious sailor volunteers the pinkie of his right hand as a votive offering. But at the smell of blood, it is a slinky little mustelid that appears. With the weasel caught and caged, the night terror is over, but the sailors will not forgive or forget the loss of a good man's finger. </Text>
