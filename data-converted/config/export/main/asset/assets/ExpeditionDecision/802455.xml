          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Too awful to be true.&lt;/b&gt; As the villagers rush, your men fire wildly, before realising they are both unarmed and intent only on recovering their food. One of them is hitâ€” a woman. There is nothing your medics can do for her. The sense of shame is only compounded on return to the ship, when a group of your men are found to have stolen supplies belonging to the villagers, in spite of everything. Your expedition can barely look one another in the eye. </Text>
