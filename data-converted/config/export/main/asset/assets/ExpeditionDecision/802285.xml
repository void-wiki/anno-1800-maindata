          <Text>&lt;b&gt;He has coughed up a lot of water, but he'll live.&lt;/b&gt; The navigators scream for someone to jump in after him, to give them time to bring the ship about. The boy is already sinking by the time his comrade catches up with him, but he is hauled to the surface where the ship is now waiting. When he finally comes to, the boy describes how beautiful the mermaid was, and how invitingly her tail swished. The sailors are so jealous of the boy, they instantly regret having bothered to save him. </Text>
