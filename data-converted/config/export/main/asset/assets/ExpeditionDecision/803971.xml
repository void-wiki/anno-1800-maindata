          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Mama bear looks angry.&lt;/b&gt; Your men had assumed that staring might make her back down, but she has taken it as a display of aggression. Her white coat is soon lank with the blood of several men. Those still standing flee. The Inuit are startled when your party &lt;b&gt;arrive at Ivujivik the next afternoon looking especially bedraggled.&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
