          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The masterful navigator swings the ship into a serendipitous breeze!&lt;/b&gt; Back-tracking slightly pays off, as they clear the shallows and carve up the bay on a beam reach, the billowing sails bearing your company crest leave the iron dragon standing. As your crew pass the enemyâ€” they see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. You make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, confident it will keep you well-hidden.</Text>
