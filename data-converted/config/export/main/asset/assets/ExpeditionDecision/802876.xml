          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The navigators swing the ship into a serendipitous breeze!&lt;/b&gt; Almost on a beam reach, the sails billow and the ship evades the iron dragon just in time. As your crew pass, they see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. You make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, hopeful it will keep you well-hidden.</Text>
