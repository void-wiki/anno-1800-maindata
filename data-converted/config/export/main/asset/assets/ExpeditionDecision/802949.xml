          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your navigator picks up plenty of speed,&lt;/b&gt; which is remarkable, since there seems little wind on the river today. The line of approach is good too, splitting the two craggiest protuberances of rock, and your ship rides up several tiers of the rapids with little more than a bump. Though a steamer might be better suited to the task, the iron dragon makes no attempt to pursue. Your captain is quick to praise the great skill of your navigator, rather than face the troubling possibility the Pyrphorians know of a greater danger to come. &lt;b&gt;The river has taken you as far as it can,&lt;/b&gt; and you must decide whether to continue across a marsh of uncertain depth, or as Ram√≥n suggests, through a nearby network of caves.</Text>
