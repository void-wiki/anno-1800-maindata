          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The search is a fruitful one.&lt;/b&gt; The well-organised diplomatic library includes a comprehensive folio of papers on nearby mine positions. This enables the navigators to chart a safe course through the waters. The very same paper remarks that the mines were moored during the war, in order to protect a now-disused outpost. You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.    </Text>
