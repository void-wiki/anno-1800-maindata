          <Text>&lt;b&gt;After an hour your sailors are all over the place&lt;/b&gt;, singing and carousing, one refusing to pay for services rendered. "Get them out!" screams the Madam. "But what of the information you promised?", "Out!". You have created enough of a scene. Fortunately two boys waiting outside cheerily agree to help you for a bit of coin. They lead your band &lt;b&gt;to a warehouse&lt;/b&gt; from they claim eerie sounds emanate at night, in their words, like "stakes being driven through the hearts of vampyrs." The door to the warehouse looks breakable.</Text>
