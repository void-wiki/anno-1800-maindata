          <Text>&lt;b&gt;They have no problem finding a tall enough tree.&lt;/b&gt; It is felled and hollowed, at least to provide some protection from a fall, and the ropes are used to secure it at either end. It is a tidy job, and your expedition passes over it in relative comfort. On the other side it is not long before Ram√≥n, Sir Archibald's man, alerts you to prints that have disturbed the red earth. Human ones. Perhaps these lead right to Isabel Sarmento? But that would mean deviating from the route on the map, and the day is beginning to grow dark.  </Text>
