          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A legend has been born!&lt;/b&gt; While some members of the crew distract the beast, one bold sailor jumps on its back and clutches the gator's neck. It takes ten more men to pin the monster's maw shut, but once it's immobilised, he pulls out a knife and sinks it into its skull. At first the creature twitches, but then it goes limp. The crew members roar as they lift the legendary trophy above their heads, marking that as the day their daring crewmate became the dragonslayer.</Text>
