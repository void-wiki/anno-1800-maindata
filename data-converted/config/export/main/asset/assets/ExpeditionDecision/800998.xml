          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Imbecile orienteers!&lt;/b&gt; There is no other way across this river valley for a hundred miles! You have covered half that distance before you realise, but having wasted a lot of time and provisions, your men may as well see this major boo-boo through. It is almost three weeks of struggle, before your expedition is back on track. </Text>
