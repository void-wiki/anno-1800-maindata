          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Audacious!&lt;/b&gt; Abandoning the steam engines, the crew focuses its efforts on using all sails available on the ship. The sailors have may not have faced tempests this grand before, but they have crossed seas and braved oceans aboard all kinds of vessels, and navigation is in their blood. The wind is faced and the waves ignored and the steering wheel locked into place, allowing the ship to stay steady until the storm passes. Not the most natural solution for a steam ship, but a good display of skill.</Text>
