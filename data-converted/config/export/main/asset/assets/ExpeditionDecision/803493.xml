          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Unfortunately, it's a pretty even contest.&lt;/b&gt; As you stalk around to the promenade behind the casino, you are hit by a warm riviera breeze and the sight of exotic palms. The doorman on this side looks muscular, at least compared to you. You take a swing at him, catching him by surprise, but he comes back hard, and a scuffle develops. "I yield," he says finally. Dusting yourself off, you take his plain black eye mask to cover your black eyes and bloody nose, and shamble into the casino. &lt;b&gt;Once inside, you debate your best bet for finding the Queen.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
