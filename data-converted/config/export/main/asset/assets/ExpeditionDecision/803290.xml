          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The phantom bride shatters!&lt;/b&gt; It was just a glass, angled to reflect a mannequin in a hidden alcove. A small man storms from the shadows. "Who do you think you are, destroying my precious illusion?" he screams. "Have you any idea how much effort, not to mention expense, I had invested in this single piece of glass, the lifelike skin of my mannequin you have pierced with your bullets! Get away from this place, get away!" Your people trudge out into the rain.</Text>
