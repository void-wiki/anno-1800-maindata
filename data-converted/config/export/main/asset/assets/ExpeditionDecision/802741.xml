          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat has a greater way with words.&lt;/b&gt; She silently enters the lower deck during the chaplain's daily preaching and waits in a corner of a room. When the man of faith finally loses his nerve and asks her what she wants, she lists two hours worth of the chaplain's arguments and, without pause, offers counterpoints for each of them. The humiliation is magnificent and the chaplain's babbling defence convinces the crew of his puerility. They lose interest.</Text>
