          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The island is alive with animals.&lt;/b&gt; While trapping a few pygmy deer, your hunters encounter a pig's head on a stick. It is rotten and buzzing with flies. As the crew moves close, a filthy old man with a beard to his waist cavorts from the treesâ€” surely a castaway who has never been found. "Don't touch him, don't touch him!" he shrieks, before turning to the pig head, "My lord, I hope these troublemakers do not disturb you?" You aren't sure this loon can be saved.</Text>
