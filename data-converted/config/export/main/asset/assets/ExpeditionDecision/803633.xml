          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The surgery was doomed to fail. &lt;/b&gt; The doctor attempts to pull out another shard, but his own wounds make him shake uncontrollably, and he punctures a major blood vessel. A nurse tries to stop the haemorrhage, but he is too late: the patient bleeds out by the murderous tree. The crew helps the sobbing doctor up and dolefully walk away from its blood-soaked roots.</Text>
