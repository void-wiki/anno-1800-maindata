          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.&lt;/b&gt; The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen. Your best shot is dead before he even touches the handle of his gun. Judging his passing to be too low a price, the prince randomly selects men among your crew and has them hanged for good measure.</Text>
