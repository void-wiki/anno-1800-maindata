          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Should have sent the second group first!&lt;/b&gt; They have no difficulty tracking the original hunting party to the dense heart of the island where they have somehow managed to get themselves lost. Perhaps it was all that fermented sapodilla fruit they have been eating! The captain jokes the woozy-looking bunch should finish the repairs alone, but everyone is just glad they've been found.</Text>
