          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The rogue sail is taken down!&lt;/b&gt; Precise shots take out its ties without so much as scratching the foremast, and the sail is sent to disappear into the storm. The lack of the sail's furious whipping seems to be enough for the mast to hold its ground. When the blizzard recedes, your ship is lacking a sail but nothing more.</Text>
