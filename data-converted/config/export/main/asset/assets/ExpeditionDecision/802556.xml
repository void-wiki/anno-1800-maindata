          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The Old Norse has much wisdom to share.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Men brave and generous live the best lives, seldom will they sorrow; then there are fools, afraid of everything, who grumble instead of giving.”&lt;br/&gt;The Sæmundar Edda serves as a gentle reminder to your sailors that their grievances are shallow and foolish. Having heard the Captain quote it the previous evening, the crew awake with open hearts and minds. And what's more, the sun is shining again. </Text>
