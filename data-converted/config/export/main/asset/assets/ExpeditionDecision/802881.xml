          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The element of surprise!&lt;/b&gt; One good hit from the shadows has done the trick! There are loud rasping noises, before the ironclad's engines fall silent, and the great monstrosity drifts to a gentle halt. As your crew escape, they must pass close by the enemyâ€” see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. You make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, confident it will keep you well-hidden.</Text>
