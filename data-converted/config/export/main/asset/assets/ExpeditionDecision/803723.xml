          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A miraculous escape!&lt;/b&gt; While some members of the crew distract the beast, one bold sailor draws a knife, jumps on its back and clutches the gator's neck. But he's no match for the monster's atrocious strength, and it easily squirms out of his embrace, shutting its maw around his arm. With a harrowing howl, the man manages to sink his knife on the alligator's skull, killing it instantly. The stump on his arm shall forever remind him of his heroic feat.</Text>
