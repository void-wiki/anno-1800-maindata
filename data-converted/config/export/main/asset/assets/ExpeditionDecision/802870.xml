          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your soldiers leap across like olympians, as the two ships pass.&lt;/b&gt;The Pyrphorians above the iron deck are few. Holes are blown in the gleeful masks of their welcome party, and fighting their way to the cannon, several of your men engage its operators, while the rest disconnect the fuel tank and toss it overboard. More masks come from below, and your men dive into the water. "If not now, we'll take you later," the thwarted enemy cry, as most of your brave saboteurs clamber back aboard, and your ship speeds away. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they bury the dead, and begin repairs to the ship.</Text>
