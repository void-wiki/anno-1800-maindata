          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your strange deduction offends Prince Ernest.&lt;/b&gt; "From your movements, I sense this is a matter of the heart," is what you had said. Prince Ernest had then turned his back on you gothically, shouting — "How dare you; prying into her personal affairs, as they all did during the crushing confines of her youth!" — before storming into the gardens to sulk. The next day the Prince seems only very slightly calmer, "she asked me to help trace our family tree— that is all. I will not stop you going after her, in spite of your impertinence, only because I am concerned for her welfare. &lt;b&gt;There is to be a masked ball in Monégasque. You will find her there."&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
