          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Fearless.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the battering gale and clobbering currents, your crew manages to keep the ship straight and face the rogue wave head on. The wave crashes into your vessel with all its rage and natural power, but the straight prow cuts its fury in two and the ship avoids most of the damage - a rock among the waters. When the storm calms down, your crew focuses on the repairs and considers how exceptional their survival was.</Text>
