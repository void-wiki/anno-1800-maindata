          <Text>&lt;b&gt;You comport yourself with dignity,&lt;/b&gt; "Your Majesty, please, I'm not here to seize you, but to assist you in any way I am able!"

It was not fifteen years previous, that a great naval victory was won here over La Corona by one Admiral Nadasky. The Lap of Victory is there waiting for you, and the Queen receives you warmly aboard. &lt;b&gt;You are finally able to ask her why it is she has run away.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
