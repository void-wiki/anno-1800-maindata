          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorian dragon is back on your tail!&lt;/b&gt; It seems hard to believe at first, the distant chugging of an engine, the bluck smudge of smoke above the ragged line of clawfoot mangrove. Your men, who had setlled enough to admire a proliferation of yellow flowers on the southern bank, suddenly find themselves at the mercy of twin horrors! For beyond the next bend, with the Pyrphorian dragon fast approaching, are a set of &lt;b&gt;devious rapids&lt;/b&gt; frothing down towards you. There is a very narrow breach at one side, through which a vessel capably navigated, may just fit. Alternatively, blasting the high cliffs could block the Pyrphorian's way.</Text>
