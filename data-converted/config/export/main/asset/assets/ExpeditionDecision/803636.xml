          <Text>&lt;b&gt;If the crew were truly under enemy fire, they would all perish. &lt;/b&gt; Not one voice is heard above the heated discussion. "Getting away from danger is the priority, just help him up!", "He'll bleed out!", "Just swathe him together and let's get out of here!". Unable to reach an agreement, and with the explosive fruit dangling above their heads, a grizzly sailor decides to take matters into his own hands â€” quite literally. "Better out than in!", he grunts, as he dips his bare fingers into the man's open wounds and pulls out the gory pieces before the horrified gaze of the doctor. But it's too late to stop him, there's a ripping sound, then a gurgle, and blood starts gushing out the man's mouth. Nothing can be done to stop the bleeding and the dreadful scene is over within a minute.</Text>
