          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Their defence of the steamship is a little half-hearted.&lt;/b&gt; Initially the men show willing, but the blizzard quickly wears them down, and they retreat inside claiming that their work is done. After the worst of it has passed, the officers survey the ship. Beneath a poorly affixed and feeble tarpaulin, the engine is found to have suffered damage, albeit fixable. &lt;b&gt;One has to wonder if they are cut out for these kinds of challenges.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
