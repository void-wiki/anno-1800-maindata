          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It is a damaging encounter.&lt;/b&gt; The rotted exterior of the pirate vessel invites cannonfire, but their movements are too clever, never exposing their flanks to a broadside. Keen to corner them, your officers overcommit, and in doing so, leave themselves open to a devastating barrage. The pirates take the chance to flee, which is fortunate, because your ship is almost dead-in-the-water.</Text>
