          <Text>A hundred metres from the graves, &lt;b&gt;the men find the remains of a camp&lt;/b&gt; at which the lost expedition wintered.

Lady Faithful recognizes her husband's handwriting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font  overrideTextColor="true" color='#695c4c'&gt;&lt;i&gt;May 28th, 1847 { H.M. ships 'Styx' and 'Hades' wintered in the ice in lat. 70˚ 05' N ; long. 98˚ 23' W. Having wintered in 1846-7 at Baffling Island, in lat. 74˚ 43' 28" N., long. 91˚ 39' 15" W., after having sailed Wailing Channel to lat. 77˚, and returned by the west side of Cornell Island. Total loss by deaths to this date has been 3 men due to sickness — Braine, Gore and Seeley, God rest their souls. Leaving tomorrow for Labrador Island. Aim to reach Passage by end June; we must be close now. John Faithful, Commander, HMS Styx.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text>
