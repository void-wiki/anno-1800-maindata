          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Following them is suspiciously easy.&lt;/b&gt; "It feels liked we've been idiots and missed something. Why would rebels in hiding leave such obvious prints? Any old man and his dog could follow them," says your tracker. "Exactly!" calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
