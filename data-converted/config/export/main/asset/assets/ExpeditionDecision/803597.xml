          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It's well that your craftsmen are so adept,&lt;/b&gt; because the impatience of the entire crew is palpable. Fortunately, by giving everyone something to do, those in charge of the repairs exude a quiet authority. Everyone learns to take pleasure in the details, and before long the ship is at least as fit for the expedition as it was before. They escape the coral corral with a profound sense of togetherness and achievement. </Text>
