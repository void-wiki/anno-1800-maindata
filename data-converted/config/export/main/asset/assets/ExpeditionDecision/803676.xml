          <Text>"Must be Brugmansiaâ€” also known as the Devil's trumpet." &lt;b&gt;Your clergyman is acutely aware of local religion,&lt;/b&gt; and knows the flower is used to induce spiritual delirium. "Once the demon trumpet has been exorcised from his belly, I shall lead both the boy and his parents to a higher place," he says with a self-satisfied air, "and this sort of thing need never happen here again." Rightly or wrongly, &lt;b&gt;your expedition will leave feeling it has done fine missionary work.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
