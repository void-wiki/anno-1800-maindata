          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your knowledge of royalty does not desert you;&lt;/b&gt; in a circle of the most elegantly-dressed people, you spy a beautiful sequined elephant, in whose hand is a foul mixture of claret and malt whiskyâ€” the Queen's favourite. Your eyes meet, and hers widen. She drops her glass, and there are gasps as she rushes for the exit. By the time you have forced your way outside, &lt;b&gt;her carriage has set off at speed. You wave another cab down, and get in.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
