          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Buried alive.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors have but a vague idea of how to dig an escape tunnel. They grind the earth with their bare hands, the pungent soil getting stuck under their nails and lining their clothes, hair, skin. As air comes to lack so does their judgement and the crew pushes forward, blind to the crumbling rock. The tunnel collapses on them and what few sailors were still outside are judged and released without any sentence - the death of their companions is punishment enough.</Text>
