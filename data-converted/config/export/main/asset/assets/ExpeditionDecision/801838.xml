          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Rejoice! The contract is right here&lt;/b&gt; waiting on the desk that dominates this sparsely-furnished room. Hannah will be delighted, with this in your possession, a war may be prevented, and the small trouble it has taken to obtain, be proven worthwhile. Indeed there is even a further windfall, a rare &lt;b&gt;fossil&lt;/b&gt; utilised as a doorstop. You may as well have the men carry it with you as you leave.</Text>
