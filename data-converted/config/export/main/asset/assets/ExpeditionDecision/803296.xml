          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Finally free of this nightmare!&lt;/b&gt; The sailors are able to help each other up to the battlements, despite the interior walls of the castle being smooth and featurelessâ€” it's almost as if they had been designed to keep people in... Once they have clambered down the ivy on the other side of the thick walls, your expedition party look for somewhere safer to sleep, if it's not too cold and wet that is.</Text>
