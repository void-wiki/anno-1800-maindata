          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The dragon is on to your dithering navigators all too soon,&lt;/b&gt; so desperate are they too avoid minor bumps of the shallows on the hull. As it approaches, the iron dragon's mouth yawns wide above your little boat, and from it the first plume of fire melts the men at the taffrail. The two hulls are close enough for boarding, but there are just too many of the rogues. You can try to target the flaming cannon, or perhaps trick them into following you to the shallows.</Text>
