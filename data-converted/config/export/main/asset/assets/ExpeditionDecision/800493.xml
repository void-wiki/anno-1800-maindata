          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The king is offended by your insolence.&lt;/b&gt; Without a word he boards a boat and heads out to sea. Some foolishly follow, believing he can be reasoned with, but they have even less knowledge of local boats than local customs. Their bodies will be dredged from the reef as your tactless expedition struggles on.  </Text>
