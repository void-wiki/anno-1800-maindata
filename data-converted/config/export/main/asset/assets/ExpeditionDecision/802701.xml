          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It only serves to demonstrate your crew's incompetence,&lt;/b&gt; because they are still not ready! The vessel belonging to the local authority fires first, and being at such close range the effect is devastating. Half of your gunners lie maimed, and your ship shredded through.
