          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Not as stealthy as you had imagined.&lt;/b&gt; As you stalk around to the promenade behind the casino, you are hit by a warm riviera breeze and the sight of exotic palms. You scale the wall without incident, but then accidently trip through a skylight. You crunch onto the rug of a guest bedroom in a rain of shattered crystal. Luckily the guest is downstairs playing craps and will not discover this mess until much later. Trying to summon whatever remaining grace you have, &lt;b&gt;you make your way inside the casino and debate your best bet for finding the Queen.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
