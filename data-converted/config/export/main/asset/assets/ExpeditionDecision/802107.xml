          <Text>&lt;b&gt;They take no strength from your crew's silent prayer.&lt;/b&gt; If only someone had offered a few more words of encouragementâ€” anything positive at all. First to cross is an old man so thin, you could fold him up and tuck him in a drawer. Clutching the fibrous rope is challenge enough for his frail wrists, and after a brief struggle with it, he droops off. His crewmates jump in with him, and commence a desperate thrash through the brown sargassum. The few that make it to your ship will only be a burden on your expedition.</Text>
