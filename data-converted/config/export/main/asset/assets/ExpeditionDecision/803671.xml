          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your envoys are sensitive to the particulars of the region,&lt;/b&gt; and the locals feel relaxed enough to talk. It seems it was the scream of a young boy: He had been misbehaving, and was given medicine so that ancestors in the spirit world might admonish him, but the medicine seems to have had a bad effect. He is trapped in nightmares, sweating and screaming the while. &lt;b&gt;The locals are worried, and look to you for help.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
