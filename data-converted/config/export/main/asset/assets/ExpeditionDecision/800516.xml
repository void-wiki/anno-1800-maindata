          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is dreadfully clumsy,&lt;/b&gt; and leaves the body almost unrecognisable. The unschooled "medic" evidently have a point to prove, and insist on defiling it further, despite being a bundle of nerves. By the end the morgue looks like a butchery, and the stricken mortician runs wildly about the ship, scalpel in hand. Several are injured trying to restrain him, but the psychological trauma of an unsolved mystery is twice as damaging.</Text>
