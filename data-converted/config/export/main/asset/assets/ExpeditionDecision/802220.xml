          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your crew's deference pleases the warriors.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised by the sailors' genuflection, the women giggle and lower their guard, lifting your explorers' chins with the tips of their lances. They may not speak your language, but their body language is unequivocal— they are fellow adventurers, and wish to celebrate your meeting. A huge bonfire is made of the wooden barricades, and all enjoy their boozy punch and haunches of venison—which they insist on eating raw— and the wild party lasts long into the night. </Text>
