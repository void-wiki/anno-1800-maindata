          <Text>&lt;b&gt;This time, the doctor takes the symptoms seriously.&lt;/b&gt; "It looks like a chemical irritation. I wonder..." The doctor rummages through the nearby flora and in time he finds it: a tall stem crowned by an umbrella of small white flowers. "A giant hogweed! Of course, its sap causes phototoxicity." Fortunately, the treatment is simple: a cold bath and a long break in the shade. Once they're clean, the doctor heals and bandages the lesions. But it comes many hours too late â€” his negligence will leave leathery red scars on the wretched few.</Text>
