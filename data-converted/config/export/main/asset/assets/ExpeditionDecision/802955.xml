          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Ramón apologises but it's not his fault.&lt;/b&gt;You have descended too far, and are forced to squeeze on your bellies through mud and guano. A chlostrophobe faints. After a few exhausting hours, all emerge to a seemingly unremarkable clearing above the S marked on your map. "But what's this?" A young sailor reveals a mossy bunker in the forest carpet, "long since deserted," he laughs, "your information must be out of date, Ramón." "Many years out of date," calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
