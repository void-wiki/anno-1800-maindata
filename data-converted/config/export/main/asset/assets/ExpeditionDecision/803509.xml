          <Text>&lt;b&gt;"A limp effort!"&lt;/b&gt; the Queen bellows down to you, as you bring the leaky fishing boat you have stolen alongside her gigantic flagship. Rather than leave you to flounder, she seems to have taken pity on you and slowed down.&lt;b&gt;"Meet me at the Cape of Trelawney, and good heavens, bring a proper vessel!"&lt;/b&gt; You slink off to find your ship at the marina and head for Trelawney, southernmost point of the Old World, where not fifteen years previous, a great naval victory was won over La Corona by the heroic Admiral Nadasky. The Lap of Victory is there waiting for you, and the Queen receives you rather icily aboard. With a gulp, &lt;b&gt;you are finally able to ask why it is she has run away.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
