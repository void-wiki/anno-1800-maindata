          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Just in time!&lt;/b&gt; The lieutenants' preaching hits the sailors harder than the hail itself, and the crew pours their last drops of effort into reefing the remaining sail. As they finish attaching the spanker, the full strength of the tempest hits the ship. To the relief of the crew the reefed sails take no damage, but the ship lurches helplessly, carried by the whims of the storm until it finally calms down.</Text>
