          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The days melt into weeks that melt into months.&lt;/b&gt; Even the probable agnostics among the crew take to prayer, for there is each passing day some fresh cause for optimism, some sign that someone is listening. Spring approaches, and some of the berg has thawed. One of the days a migratory bird is spotted. At long, long last, a vast chunk of the berg separates, leaving the ship mere metres from open water. A day of heaving has it afloat again, though your men have lost all notion of time.</Text>
