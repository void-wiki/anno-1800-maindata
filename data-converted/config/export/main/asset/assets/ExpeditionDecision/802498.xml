          <Text>&lt;b&gt;To safety!&lt;/b&gt; Maneuvering with half the sails while facing oversized waves, pounding hail and incoming lightning is as difficult as it sounds. And yet the crew does it. Relying not on the sails, but on the ship's bilge keel and its keel-protecting apron, they spear through the wind without being driven sideways away from it. The boat leaps in the trough of waves, pushed by the raging force of the elements, offering the most resistance it can offer - until, at last, the tempest is left behind.</Text>
