          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The ghostly dinner guest shatters!&lt;/b&gt; It was just a glass angled to reflect an old mannequin! "Please!" A dimunitive and smartly-dressed man emerges from the shadows, hands aloft, "I'm Jean-Eug√®ne Poivre, and this is my latest invention!" Relief turns to wonder, as they marvel at the life-like mannequin he has created for the illusion. "Permit me to make it up to you!" he beams, flipping a switch and filling the hall with electric light. "Geoffery," he calls up to the rafters, "Inform the cooks we shall have guests tonight!" </Text>
