          <Text>&lt;b&gt;You are somehow able to communicate that you are suffering.&lt;/b&gt; Many of the Flower-eaters are seeing visions themselvesâ€” the effect they expect by consuming the plant. The locals interrupt their own lucid dreaming to help your expedition through it, realising your lack of experience in such rites of passage. The next day, your cosmic travellers feel relieved to return to the more familiar rocking of their ship.</Text>
