          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The shot is good, but takes too long to line up.&lt;/b&gt; You are very close to the dragon's mouth when it is hit, and the eruption of flaming debris is most violent! Your own ship and men are on the receving end, taking damage and casualties. Luckily, there is chaos enough aboard the Pyrphorian ship for your crew to hightail it out of the bay. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they bury the dead and begin repairs to the ship.</Text>
