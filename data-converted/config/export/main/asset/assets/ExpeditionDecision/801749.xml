          <Text>&lt;b&gt;There is no sign of the Pyrphorians&lt;/b&gt;, at least not that any of your twits see. Giving up their search, they begin stopping locals in the street. Most shake them off and walk on in a hurry. But they finally seem to strike lucky when two boys cheerily agree to help for a bit of coin. They lead your band &lt;b&gt;to a warehouse&lt;/b&gt; from which they claim eerie sounds emanate at night, in their words, like "stakes being driven through the hearts of vampyrs." The door to the warehouse looks breakable.</Text>
