          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your beagle follows the faint tracks keenly.&lt;/b&gt; After a few cheerful hours of tramping, you reach a seemingly unremarkable clearing. "But what's this?" A young sailor reveals a mossy bunker in the forest carpet, "long since deserted," he laughs. "Or so you might hope!" calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
