          <Text>&lt;b&gt;This castle was clearly designed to keep people in.&lt;/b&gt; Strangely, no ladder or stair is found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. But after what feels like hours wandering the laberinthine corridors of the keep, a peculiar door swings open. It appears to lead to a master bedroom. A soft, plaintive song rises from within, where a young woman is found at her mirror. She sits combing her hair, her bridal dress soiled and torn, and her face impossibly pale.</Text>
