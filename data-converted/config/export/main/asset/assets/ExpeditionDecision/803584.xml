          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Something changes behind the old man's eyes&lt;/b&gt; upon hearing the spoken word again. "Forgive me, my Lord receives few visitors to his kingdom. Pray, from what kingdom come you?"&lt;/br&gt;When they describe his own homeland, the old man begins to weep. "Home! They want to take me home!" He bows to the pig head. "My Lord, with your permission I would leave your service and ... Oh really my Lord? Thank you, thank you so much!"&lt;/br&gt;There are plenty of supplies for the ship, and over the next few days voyage, the old man slowly recovers his humanity, regaling the fabulous tale of his marooning.</Text>
