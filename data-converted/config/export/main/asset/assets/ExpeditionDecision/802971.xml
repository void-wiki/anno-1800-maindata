          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It proves a good decision.&lt;/b&gt; After a cheerful stretch, you reach a seemingly unremarkable clearing above the S marked on your map. "But what's this?" A young sailor reveals a mossy bunker in the forest carpet, "long since deserted," he laughs, "your information must be out of date, Ram√≥n." "Many years out of date," calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
