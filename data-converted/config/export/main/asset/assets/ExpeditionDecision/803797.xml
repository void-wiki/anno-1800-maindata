          <Text>"If anybody knows anything, if you are protecting somebody who doesn't deserve to be protected, it is now time to come forward. There is no shame in reporting criminal. On the contrary, you are doing society a favor. If you come forward now, we will be merciful and forgive you for not speaking up earlier. But should we discover later than you knew all along, then you will share the murderer's fate." The diplomat speech has a strong effect. Sailors start to murmur between themselves when unexpectedly one of them comes forward "I know who did it. I am sorry Jimmy but you can't get away with it" he says as he turns toward the cook assistant. 'Jimmy wanted to punish Robert and Charles for mistreating him but he didn't realize the poison would be so strong it would kill them". A murder is a murder, even if unvoluntary. Young Jimmy is seized and hanged. The crew is relieved the perpetrator has been found but sad to see a young man die for a stupid mistake. </Text>
