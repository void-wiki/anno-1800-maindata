          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors in disguise orchestrate the children's escape.&lt;/b&gt; Dressed with the bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn turned sweat shop where children are forced to work. One by one they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies: when the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunitions. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.</Text>
