          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The men are brought to safety!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors bind the wounded with a clever construction of marine knots that supports them and divides their weights across the safety rope. Pulling them up is so easy the injured can even spare a laugh while swinging across the ice wall. The successful teamwork brought your sailors closer than ever, and it is a group of brothers and sisters which brings the wounded back to the ship.</Text>
