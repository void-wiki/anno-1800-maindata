          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Saved by a cow with cowpox.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctors remember that the "vacca" of vaccination means cow, and extract cowpox from the pustuled udders of a local beast. Everyone receives the injection, which due to the lack of appropriate facilities the doctor is unable to purify. Fortunately this only results in a number of outbreaks of other, much less destructive infections.</Text>
