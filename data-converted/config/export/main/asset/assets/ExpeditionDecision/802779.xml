          <Text>&lt;b&gt;There's neither spirit nor courage to be roused.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew instead seem transfixed by the approaching spectre of doom. Even as the horde board, the defenders minds seem elsewhere, hypnotised perhaps by the tall and angular captain with greying hair and wizened visage, who stalks the deck juicing your sailors. Once the pirates have taken everything they desire, they leave as mysteriously as they appeared. </Text>
