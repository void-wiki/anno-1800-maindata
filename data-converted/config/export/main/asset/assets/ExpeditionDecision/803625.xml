          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The most upsetting weeks of their lives ensue from the thoughtless decision. &lt;/b&gt; The constant wailing of the aching bunch wrecks everyone's nerves. Their blisters become as unbearably painful as nauseating to behold â€” they continue to swell, covering up most of their bodies. It takes days for the throbbing bags of liquid to pop and peel off, leaving the hosts with bright red oozing wounds. Massive scars will forever remind them of their harrowing pain.</Text>
