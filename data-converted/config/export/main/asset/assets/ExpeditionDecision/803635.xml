          <Text>&lt;b&gt;"I've witnessed more grenade injuries than I'd like to remember; this is no different". &lt;/b&gt; A grizzly sailor comes forward and pushes the injured doctor aside. "We can't repair the damage, but we may be able to contain it long enough for him to get to a clinic." He ties a firm knot around the critical areas and tightly braces the wounded man with cloth and bandages to prevent any potential haemorrhages. It is not perfect, and the man's howls clearly state that it is in no way painless, but he survives long enough to be treated at the nearest village.</Text>
