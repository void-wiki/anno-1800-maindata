          <Text>&lt;b&gt;You sneak upon proof it is her cousin Ernest she was visiting.&lt;/b&gt; While the Prince's welcome is polite, his stiffness of manner alerts your suspicions. And when, after tea, he gives you the freedom of the ivy-clad castle, you waste no time seeking signs she was there. You find paper on the desk in a guest bedroom impressed with quill-marks, and make a rubbing. A letter from the queen to her handmaid! It largely concerns itself with Ernest's handsome looks.&lt;b&gt;When you rasie the subject with Prince Ernest, he becomes rather twitchy.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
