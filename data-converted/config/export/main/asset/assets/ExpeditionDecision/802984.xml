          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Communication is excellent.&lt;/b&gt; The correct knots are used for the guy ropes, and with the experience of soldiering among you the descent is painless. At the bottom, you skip over a small creek babbling towards the mother river, before commencing a successful climb up the other side. Back on track, it is not long before Ram√≥n, Sir Archibald's man, alerts you to prints that have disturbed the red earth. Human ones. Perhaps these lead right to Isabel Sarmento? But that would mean deviating from the route on the map, and the day is beginning to grow dark.  </Text>
