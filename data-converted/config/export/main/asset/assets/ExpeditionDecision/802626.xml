          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Where did they come from? Where should they go?&lt;/b&gt; The melting snow splits into a web of entangled streams which buries under the ground and resurfaces without any apparent logic. The crew is taken by the illusion that the forest around them is flat and can no longer tell if they are climbing or descending. They split like the streams themselves, to each sailor their trickle, and like the streams not all of them find the feet of the mountain.</Text>
