          <Text>&lt;b&gt;An alternate entrance is found after a long while.&lt;/b&gt; Alternate is a euphemism: the sailors went deep into the entrails of the glacier and instead of finding a way to the crevasse, they discerned a fault in the thin ice wall. Breaking it allowed them inside but their delayed arrival, rather than soothe the fallen men, triggers their ire: couldn't they have come faster? Don't they see their freezing limbs? Don't they know the fright they caused?</Text>
