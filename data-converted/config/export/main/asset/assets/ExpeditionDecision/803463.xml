          <Text>&lt;b&gt;You have lost some face in royal circles.&lt;/b&gt; "I shall tell you nothing, nothing!" Prince Ernest says curtly, exhausted by your chatter, "yet another prying into her personal affairs, as so many did through the crushing confines of her youth!" The Queen's cousin then storms into the gardens to sulk. The next day he seems only very slightly calmer, "she asked me to help trace our family tree— that is all. I will not stop you going after her, in spite of your impertinence, only because I am concerned for her welfare. &lt;b&gt;There is to be a masked ball in Monégasque. You will find her there."&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
