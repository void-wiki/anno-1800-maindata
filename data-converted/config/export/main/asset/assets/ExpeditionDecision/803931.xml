          <Text>It is late summer when the expedition reaches the Tchilling Sound, and yet &lt;b&gt;the conditions in these icy seas are already challenging.&lt;/b&gt; The wind only has to pick up, and the men are tugging up their collars and tramping below. It seems hopeless to think Sir John Faithful's men could have lasted three winters here. Beyond Tchilling Sound, the seaway divides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the west&lt;/b&gt; lie a chain of small islands separated by partially melted ice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the south&lt;/b&gt;, a long, dark headland crowned with snow, that hazes out of sight.</Text>
