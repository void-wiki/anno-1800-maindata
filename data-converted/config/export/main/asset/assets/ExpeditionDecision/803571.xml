          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The words serve to scorn the sick, and the weak:&lt;/b&gt; their meaning in effect being, "if you can't defend your share of what's left, you don't deserve to survive." It is only much later, when the ship is in port, that your brutes rediscover their compassion. They realise the expertise they have left for deadâ€” those misfortunate enough to have been poisoned by mushrooms, or indeed, for having shown any other very human frailty.</Text>
