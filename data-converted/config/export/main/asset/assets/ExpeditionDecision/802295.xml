          <Text>&lt;b&gt;What you have done is illegal,&lt;/b&gt; and the crew have no difficulty making their displeasure known. After the bo'sun has beaten a man's back to a pulp, the crew gather on the top deck, where the cries of the mermaid can still be heard, although it sounds like weeping now. "That act was outlawed a half century ago. We hereby notify you of our forthcoming testimony against the bo'sun in court of law, that is, if we ever manage to return." Morale aboard stoops to a new low. </Text>
