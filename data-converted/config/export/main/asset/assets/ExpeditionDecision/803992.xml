          <Text>The hands trembling with fear, the man tries to seize his riffle on the floor, drops it, seize it again, charges it but has no time to aim before the bear leaps on him and tears him down. As the beast is busy with their companion, the rest of the group runs toward what appears to be a fire a few hundred meters away. It's an Inuit camp, rush into the safety of one of the hut as the local stare at them, startled. The bear doesn't seem to have followed.</Text>
