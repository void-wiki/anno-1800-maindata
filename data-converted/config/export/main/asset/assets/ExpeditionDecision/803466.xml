          <Text>&lt;b&gt;You know it's the wrong choice from the moment you walk into the parlour.&lt;/b&gt; The Duchess, who is of middle-age, lies half-asleep in a four-posted bed, which from her dishevilled appearance it seems she has not left in days. "Excuse my zurprise," she croaks, "But a Queen, come here? When our zide of the family has been neglected for years?" She feigns a tortured expression. "But now we have darling visitors!" Anxious not to offend, you remain in her company until she eventually tires of her games. She lets slip the Queen is visiting her cousin, Prince Ernest. &lt;b&gt;The Prince offers you a cordial welcome at his ivy-clad castle, but appears twitchy throughout.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
