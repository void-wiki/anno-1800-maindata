          <Text>Look in the eyes to appear as if they are not afraid but the bear is not intimated, it takes it as a sign of aggression. The men, trembling, appear to be no match for the beast. It charges and rip one of the men to pieces. As the beast is busy with their companion, the rest of the group runs toward what appears to be a fire a few hundred meters away. It's an Inuit camp, rush into the safety of one of the hut as the local stare at them, startled. The bear doesn't seem to have followed.</Text>
