          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your aim is true, but the dragon is gathering its hot breath.&lt;/b&gt; To engage with the hulking vessel is a humbling experience— the size, the power, the feet-thick armoured hull that your ordnance seems only to bounce limply off. The crew seem defeated until they realise their precise fire at the dragon's stern, while showing no external sign of damage, appears to have caused a problem in the engine room. As a response, masked figures rush to prime the beastly mouth—a great cannon of fire! You must act quickly.</Text>
