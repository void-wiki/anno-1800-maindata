          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The trigger of catastrophy.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors tie planks and poles around the masts, pulling chains around them as tightly as they can, oblivious to the carpentry laws ruling over the movement of towering objects. The masts try to break free of the man-made prisons and jump out of them, crashing onto the deck one after the other. As if chased by the hysteria below, the blizzard flees and lets sunrays fall on the barren carcass of your ship.</Text>
