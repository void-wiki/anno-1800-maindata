          <Text>&lt;b&gt;One of your sailors has no natural throw.&lt;/b&gt; His grenado springs back from the rigging onto your own deck, exploding into a stinking cloud of shrapnel. Since both ships have casualties and chaos, your quick-thinking steersman takes a chance and sets sail. As your crew escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemyâ€” to see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they bury the dead and begin repairs to the ship.</Text>
