          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Someone puts bandages around the wounds in a haphazard fashion,&lt;/b&gt; as if they were mere scratches. "Change the bandages every few days" is the advice, but the abcess that has formed beneath soon bursts and the vile infection spreads. &lt;b&gt;He dies in his sleep.&lt;/b&gt; For the others, their negligence will forever remain a source of great shame, for no man is an island, and the death of each man diminishes the whole.</Text>
