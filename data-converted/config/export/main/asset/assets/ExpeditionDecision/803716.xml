          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A feat everyone will remember!&lt;/b&gt; It takes ten men to restrain the alligator and pull its maw open only a tiny slit, but it is enough for your navigator to pull her chewed-out arm out. As she stumbles away gripping her limp arm, a sailor sinks a knife in the beast's neck and it slowly stops twisting and wriggling. Everyone is bruised and scratched, and the navigator might never fully recover from her wounds, but she will never forget they way her comrades risked their lives to save hers.</Text>
