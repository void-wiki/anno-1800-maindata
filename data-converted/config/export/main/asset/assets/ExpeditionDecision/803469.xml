          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Following Prince Ernest's advice, you travel by train along the sparkling Côte Turquoise to a grand station in the sophisticated principality of Monégasque.&lt;/b&gt; Ruled for six centuries by the Piedmont family, today the streets of Monégasque are filled with colour and light, for it is the grand opening of its very first casino! The theme is animal masquerade, and you see disturbing furred and feathered costumes at every turn. Convenient for a Queen going incognito... &lt;b&gt;Prince Ernest gave you his own invitation to the casino, but you will also need a costume.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
