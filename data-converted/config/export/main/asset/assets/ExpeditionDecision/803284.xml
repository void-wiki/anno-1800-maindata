          <Text>&lt;b&gt;There is a way over the walls!&lt;/b&gt; Strangely, no ladder or stair is found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. Through a maze of shadowy rooms, and hallways, lit only by the occasional flash, the crew discovers a staircase to the third floor. From there they emerge to the wall, and descend the dark and lush ivy on its exterior, welcoming the feel of the pouring rain, from which they had so recently sought to hide.</Text>
