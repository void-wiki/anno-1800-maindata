Your crew need reminding too; mouths covered when coughing, the avoidance of skin contact, and the frequent washing of hands in alcoholic solution. It is chastening that your mere presence has caused the death of that poor girl, but after two weeks without further cases, it is certainly a relief it does not appear to have spread.</Text>
