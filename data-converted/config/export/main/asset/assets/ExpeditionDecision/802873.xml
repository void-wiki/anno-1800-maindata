          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The dragon is thwarted,&lt;/b&gt; though it catches your ship and crew with one final breath of fire. Nevertheless your lucky hit to its stern has done the trick. There are loud rasping noises from the ironclad's engines as it noticeably slows, and drifts to a gentle halt. As your crew escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemyâ€” to see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they bury the dead and begin repairs to the ship.</Text>
