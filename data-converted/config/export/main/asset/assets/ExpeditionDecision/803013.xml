          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Alas, your mast is not spared.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors shoot at the ties of the fore sail but the task is too meticulous for them: they shoot at the ropes, the poles, the mast itself. The raging sail is swallowed by the storm while the foremast collapses and crushes the starboard. In a final irony, the storm soon calms down and lets your crew calculate how their lack of meddling would have caused less damage.</Text>
