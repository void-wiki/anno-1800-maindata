          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The doctor knows botanicals.&lt;/b&gt; In the dregs of the medicine cup, the doctor finds Brugmansia, also called Devil's Trumpet, an hallucinogenic plant known for its power to terrify. Though often used in ritual here, the dosage seems high for a child. The other villagers don't seem surprised, because his parents are the local idiots. The villagers are glad the doctor is able to help pump the poison from the boy's stomach, and after a few days he is back to his usual impish self. &lt;b&gt;Your expedition are proud to have been of help.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
