          <Text>&lt;b&gt;"Another week? Can't you see we're all going to die here!?"&lt;/b&gt; The beefy sailor rips the hammer from the carpenter's hand. Survival instinct has thrown the existing order into disarray, and from this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefieldâ€” hoarded resources become motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair the ship and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.</Text>
