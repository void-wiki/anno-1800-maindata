          <Text>In the dead of the night the group is more and more scattered as one of the men has a harder time following. He falls behind. This is the moment the beast chooses to target the weakest of the pack. The group hears a muffled sound, a piercing screams and horrible growling mixed with tearing and chewing noises. As the group turns toward the noise in terror, they see an enormous polar bear.</Text>
