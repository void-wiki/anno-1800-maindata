          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A wader is too occuped with the myth of fifty-foot anaconda,&lt;/b&gt; to see the real danger. The mass of driftwood he reaches for are in fact caiman, sinking their teeth deep into his torso, for which there will be no remedy. Hours of pensive tramping later, your expedition coems to a seemingly unremarkable clearing above the S marked on your map. "But what's this?" A young sailor reveals a mossy bunker in the forest carpet, "long since deserted," he laughs, "your information must be out of date, Ram√≥n." "Many years out of date," calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
