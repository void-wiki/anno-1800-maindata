          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The missing sailors are found, and with them an exit.&lt;/b&gt; The idea of losing their companions pushes the hunters to persevere. Broken twigs, brushed moss, mud splashes: everything is a hint. They follow the trail to a crossing and find the lost sailors, who welcome them heartily: they have found a beaten path which leads straight to the feet of the mountain! That they believed in the others and waited for them is a reward in and of itself.</Text>
