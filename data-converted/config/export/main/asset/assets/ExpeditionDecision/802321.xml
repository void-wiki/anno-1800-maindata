          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A track leading over these impenetrable mountains should be a blessing,&lt;/b&gt; yet your men are having doubts. Your guide for a start, absolutely refuses to go up that way. In fact, the idea scares him. At the base of the mountain, which juts ferrous and fibrous above the green like a chunk of braised meat, is a stone head carved in the rock. It grins awfully, and between its huge square teeth is what appears to be a severed arm.</Text>
