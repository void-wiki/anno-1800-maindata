          <Text>&lt;b&gt;You receive no answer.&lt;/b&gt; Looking at your message again, it does seem a little abruptâ€” "STOP IN THE NAME OF SIR ARCHIBALD." You pursue at great distance towards Trelawney, southernmost point of the Old World, where not fifteen years previous, a great naval victory was won over La Corona by the heroic Admiral Nadasky. The Lap of Victory slows to a halt, and the Queen receives you rather icily aboard. With a gulp, &lt;b&gt;you are finally able to ask why it is she has run away.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
