          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A job carried with few hitches.&lt;/b&gt; Making sure that they do not damage the ship itself, your sailors fire cannonball after cannonball, taking the time to appraise an readjust their aim with each new shot. The ship's hull is grazed by the first shots and soon the floe parts before the vessel, the ice blocks gliding against each other with menacing cracks. The trapped crew profusely thanks yours! Your sailors revel in their saviour act, trying to ignore the emaciated faces and feeble voices.</Text>
