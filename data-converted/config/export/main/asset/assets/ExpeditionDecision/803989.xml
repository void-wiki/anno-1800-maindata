          <Text>After such a long walk, the guard has a hard time keeping his eyes opened. He starts to drowse by the fire. It takes a strong growl behind for him to realize the danger, a polar bear!, but it is too late. The beast's claws rip a poor mate and dig as deep as his rib cage. In one scream he is dead. It then turns toward the rest of the group.</Text>
