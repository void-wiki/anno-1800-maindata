          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The decision to run is not a simple one.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be and retreat to the village with the few children they have saved. They share what information they can with the villagers - maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, more planning... As the ship leaves the crew focuses on the good they did, rather than the deeds they could have done.</Text>
