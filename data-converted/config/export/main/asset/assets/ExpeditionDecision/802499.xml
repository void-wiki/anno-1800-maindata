          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A close call.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating with so little sails proves more difficult than expected and the proximity of the thunderstorm makes the sea even wilder. The ship rolls among the gigantic waves, sailed more than it sails, and it is lifted and shifted by the whims of the tempest. The crew's maneuvers equal to choosing which less terrible wave they wish to crash into. When the storm recedes, the damage is somewhat acceptable.</Text>
