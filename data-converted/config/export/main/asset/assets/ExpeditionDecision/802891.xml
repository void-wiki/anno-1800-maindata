          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It's a rough ride.&lt;/b&gt; Bumped from beneath, and burned from behind, your ship and crew scrape clear of the bay just before the dragon can issue a fatal torching. At the last moment the wind catches what remains of the sails, and the Pyrphorians are left stranded. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they bury the dead and begin extensive repairs to the ship.</Text>
