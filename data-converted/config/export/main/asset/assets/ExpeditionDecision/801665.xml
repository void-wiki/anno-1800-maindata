          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorians are escaping with the contract!&lt;/b&gt; The smoke of battle has screened a small craft, that is now racing clear of the skirmish! The entire assault must have been a diversion to sneak them in and out with the papers! You and Hannah may never know the truth unless you get them back. They have quite a headstart, but you might catch them in a chase. Alternatively, as few harbours nearby will grant them sanctuary, you can try to anticipate their likely heading.</Text>
