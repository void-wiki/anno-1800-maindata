          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It is bold, but the Pyrphorians above the iron deck are stronger.&lt;/b&gt; Your soldiers leap across, trying to fight their way to the cannon. More masks come from below the gnarled iron deck, and your saboteurs are doomed. To ensure their sacrifice is not in vain, your quick-thinking steersman takes advantage of the chaos and forces your ship past the enemy— in time to see the army of mocking masks running your men through—and out of the bay to safety. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they bury the dead and begin repairs to the ship.</Text>
