          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The behaviour of your expedition is shameful.&lt;/b&gt; One of the Flower-eaters is shoved to the ground in front of her children. When several others pile into the scrum, one of your crew, who shall go unnamed, decides to set fire to a watermill in protest. This doesn't help anyone still having hallucinations. The next morning when they awake, everyone claims not to remember anything.</Text>
