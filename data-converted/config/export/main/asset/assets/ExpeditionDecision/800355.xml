          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.&lt;/b&gt; A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.</Text>
