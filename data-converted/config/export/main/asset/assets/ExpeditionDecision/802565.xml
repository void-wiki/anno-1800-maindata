          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The diplomat makes things worse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion!"&lt;br/&gt;A line of argument both insulting, and untrue, since the clergymen aboard only stand to receive a small church stipend for their efforts. "Faithless lot! We do not do this for greed as you so plainly do!" Needless to say, the tensions that a few careful words might so easily have relieved, now threaten to sabotage your expedition.</Text>
