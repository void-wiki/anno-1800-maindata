          <Text>&lt;b&gt;You cannot keep the irritation from your voice,&lt;/b&gt; "Your Majesty, please, desist from this charade!" The short rotund figure turns, dresses in hand, and a small but defiant voice floats cuts the sound of the sea. "I am not a child, I am your Queen! Be at the Cape of Trelawney tomorrow, or else." You slink off to find your ship at the marina and head for Trelawney, southernmost point of the Old World, where not fifteen years previous, a great naval victory was won over La Corona by the heroic Admiral Nadasky. The Lap of Victory is there waiting for you, and the Queen receives you rather icily aboard. With a gulp, &lt;b&gt;you are finally able to ask why it is she has run away.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
