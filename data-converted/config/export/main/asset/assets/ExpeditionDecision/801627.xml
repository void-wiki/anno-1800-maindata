          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Ice crumbles all around such firepower.&lt;/b&gt; Any cannon that can be swiveled at the target is put to use, chipping away the ice dungeon into which the ship has become wedged until the way is clear. Then like a cheerful sea lion the fair vessel slips down an escarpment and plops back into the water. The crew cheer and continue on their way.</Text>
