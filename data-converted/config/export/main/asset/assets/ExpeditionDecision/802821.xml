          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The perfect crime!&lt;/b&gt; Despite their numbers, your sailors manage to sneak through the prison and into the streets, where they become shadows under the moonless night. Led by your most competent hunters, they creep through back alleys and backyards until the obscurity delivers them below their ship. Feeling like the protagonists of an adventure novel and revelling in the sentiment, they leave the harbour in the gliding vessel - all lights off and no sound made.</Text>
