          <Text>They were told to follow the channels so just do that. The men do not try to identify which is most likely to be the right one and disperse in smaller groups to cover as much ground as possible. Many days are lost waiting for all the patrols to come back empty-handed, unable to follow the channels to an end (more focus on their lack of ability to follow the channel, cant traverse the land, give up too early). The ship captain is forced to pick a channel randomly. Unfortunately the one he picked just hugs high instable glacier with no open sea in sight. Suddenly rumble, at starboard the glacier just under which the crew is about the pass by starts to collapse.</Text>
