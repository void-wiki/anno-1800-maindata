          <Text>The crew easily spots a piece of paper on the wall which looks nothing like a map to the untrained eyes. Though confusing, they manage to make sense of it and find the galley registration office., ground floor, first corridor on the right.&lt;/br&gt;"We need to register a galley". "You didn't need to come here" says the office lady, "a stamp from the harbor master would have been enough. Luckily I have one here, here you go". The crew feels lucky to be done with an administrative procedure so fast.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Beat them at their own game</Text>
