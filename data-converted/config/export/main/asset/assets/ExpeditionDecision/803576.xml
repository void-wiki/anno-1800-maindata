          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The system creates confusion and division.&lt;/b&gt; "Listen to someone because they're holding a shell? Who do you take us for?" the first mate leans raffishly from a rock wall, "but if you want to do things properly around here, then with me!" &lt;br/&gt;From this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefieldâ€” hoarded resources become motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair the ship and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.</Text>
