          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is conducted very capably,&lt;/b&gt; and confirms the midshipman took his own life. A severe tumour is also discovered on the midshipman's brain. A letter, found later, serves to explain that the fellow knew he hadn't long to live, and wished to face death in his own way. The crew are galvanised on hearing this story of bravery.</Text>
