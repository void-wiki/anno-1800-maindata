          <Text>&lt;b&gt;An extreme but commendable choice.&lt;/b&gt; The sailor is given rum to drink and cloth to bite before he is held in place, his leg bound with a tight tourniquet.

When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels that they are in capable hands.</Text>
