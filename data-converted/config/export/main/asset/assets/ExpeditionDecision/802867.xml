          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The shot is good enough.&lt;/b&gt; A canister of gas fueling their weapon whistles free of its housing, and blows fire spasmodically about the deck. Some of the mystery of the enemy disappears in that instant, as the cowled crows fight to regain control. As your crew escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemyâ€” to see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they begin repairs to the ship.</Text>
