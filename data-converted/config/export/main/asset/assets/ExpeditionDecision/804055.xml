          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It was never going to work,&lt;/b&gt; using a heavy, blunt instrument to make his hole. Lucky as it happens, that the carpenter is alone as his sledgehammer comes down, sundering the ice all about him and casting him into the freezing water. Turns out the ice is fairly thick, but that won't save the poor fellow now. The others trudge for the thin comforts of the disused trading post in disbelief. </Text>
