          <Text>&lt;b&gt;It takes all their calm&lt;/b&gt; for your men to fan into the forest. There's a thud: one of the dart-blowers has been struck down with the butt of a rifle. Whistles all around signal a retreat, leaving your men to examine one of the six-foot blowpipes: perhaps they left knowing the damage was already done? Sure enough, those hit begin wheezing heavily, collapsing to the floor. &lt;b&gt;The darts are tipped with poison!&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
