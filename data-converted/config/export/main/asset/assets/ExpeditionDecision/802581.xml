          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are not made to catch land animals.&lt;/b&gt; The hunt ends in failure, the most your crew saw of a wild horse being weathered tracks in the dry roads. Instead of leading your hunters to a herd, the tracks drive them to a run-down town of wooden buildings -several houses and a single saloon-, its lanterns brightening with the growing darkness. Night is well on its way and tracking the thieves seems almost impossible now.</Text>
