          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The explosion drowns the enemy in a cloud of stench.&lt;/b&gt; The coughing and groaning is only the after-effect of the salvo of the grenados, whose shrapnel penetrates the crowd of crows. As your crew escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemyâ€” to see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they begin repairs to the ship.</Text>
