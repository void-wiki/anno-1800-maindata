          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The wild horses have spirit worth harnessing!&lt;/b&gt; Though they are newly broken, eyes crazed, nostrils flaring, one of your horse-whisperers soon has them eating from her palm. At a gallop, they have boundless energy, and &lt;b&gt;the thieves' headstart is gone in no time.&lt;/b&gt; The skunks are surrounded, stripped, and left to the elements. The stolen monies are returned to the coffers, and the expedition is fandangoing once more!</Text>
