          <Text>&lt;b&gt;A bold move!&lt;/b&gt; Releasing the anchor right as the ship reaches an upright position and begins to yaw again is the perfect timing to stop the chaotic rolling. The sailboat protests against the maneuver, trembling under the insistence of the waves, but obediently follows your crew's demands as they can finally steer it away from the storm. Unnerved but alive, the sailors agree that they have seen and done enough risk-taking for the day.</Text>
