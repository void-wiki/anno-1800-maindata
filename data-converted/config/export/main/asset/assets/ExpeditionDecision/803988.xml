          <Text>Despite his exhaustion, the guard keeps his sharpness and notices the sound of soft paws on the snow. The beast tried to be discrete but the hunter is already ready. As soon as he has it in range, he shots, a precise shot in the head. The bear collapses on the floor. The rest of the men are woken up with a jolt. When they realize what happened, they praise the hunter for saving their lives. The group is now closer than ever. They left the ship as companions and reach the Inuit camp as friends.</Text>
