          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The trial goes as well as can be expected.&lt;/b&gt; The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was  trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.</Text>
