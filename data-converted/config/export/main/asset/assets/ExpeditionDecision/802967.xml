          <Text>&lt;b&gt;An expedition party leaves the ship in capable hands,&lt;/b&gt; and sets out into the vast green. It is hard to relate the enchantment that falls upon those adventurers, to whom this alien world is entirely new, from the whoop and squawk of feathers and the gleeful chattering of capuchin. An ocelot scarpers, a serpent slumbers. Ants bear all the burdens of their kingdom along their leafy conduits, their royal quest in parallel to your own. After several hours of happy tramping, you reach a steep but narrow ravine. If the map suggests some natural bridge across, you do not see it, and the breach in the earth stretches out of sight in either direction. Either you &lt;b&gt;go down and back up with ropes,&lt;/b&gt; or try to &lt;b&gt;construct a simple bridge.&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
