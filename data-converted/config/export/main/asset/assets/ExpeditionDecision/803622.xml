          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The ritual is a most unholy sight. &lt;/b&gt; "Sunlight will purge your curse, bear the pain as evil oozes out of your body!" The cursed few writhe under the scorching sun, as their blisters slowly morph into aberrant lumps of fluid. Everyone's beliefs shake before the nauseating vision. By sundown, they can barely move. It takes days for the throbbing bags of liquid to pop and peel off, leaving the hosts with bright red festering wounds. Massive scars will forever remind them of how they were forsaken by the gods.</Text>
