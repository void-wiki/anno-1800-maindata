          <Text>The captain is a true master of the Arctic. He compensates for the inaccuracy of the compass due to the closeness of the magnetic pole with a strong knowledge of the stars positions in this part of the world. He analyses the shapes of the glaciers and the position of the channels to deduce which routes has the most change to have an opening onto the sea. Take it, within a few hours the open sea is in sight.</Text>
