          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The contract and those Pyrphorians must be here in Montoya, but where?&lt;/b&gt; The city sprawls before you under a pastel blue sky, the distinctive whitewall and terracotta of Imperial La Corona glowing softly all along the narrow estuary where the Mixcoatl meets the ocean.

You can ask around, or rely instead on your own eyes to find clues.</Text>
