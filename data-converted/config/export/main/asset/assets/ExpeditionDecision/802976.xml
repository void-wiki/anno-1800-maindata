          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Finding a big enough tree is not the problem.&lt;/b&gt; It is felled and lowered over the chasm, with ropes used to secure it at either end. "It looks a little bit wobbly!" says Ramón, Sir Archibald's man. He is right of course, since there is nothing to cling to but the frangible bark, and several of your expedition are even very close to falling before one finally does. "Don't look! She's gone!" Ramón calls out. Resuming their trek, morale is low until someone spots a human bootprint on the forest floor. Perhaps these lead right to Isabel Sarmento? But that would mean deviating from the route on the map, and the day is beginning to grow dark.  </Text>
