          <Text>&lt;b&gt;There is not quite enough expertise to travel on in darkness,&lt;/b&gt; which apart from the eyes, is total. Your company build a great bonfire for comfort, and wait for morning. But there is another presence here too, which decides only now to make itself known. "You do not belong here," calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
