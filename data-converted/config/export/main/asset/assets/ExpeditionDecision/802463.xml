          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The savage bandits find the expedition before it can find them.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the indigenous people who built these huts were dispossesed of them long ago, and that they now serve as a refuge for scoundrels. They whoop and holler from the trees and descend upon a few valiant defenders as the rest of the expedition turns and flee for the ship. </Text>
