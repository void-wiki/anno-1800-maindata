          <Text>&lt;b&gt;Fine seamanship.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew understand there's no point hiding now, and light the lanterns again, revealing the true depth of the water. Your helmsmen dance your ship through the shallows in fluent chass√©, zig-zagging ahead of the cumbersome dragon. Once out of the bay, the wind catches the sails, and the Pyrphorians are left stranded. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. Your crew make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, where they begin repairs to the bottom of the ship.</Text>
