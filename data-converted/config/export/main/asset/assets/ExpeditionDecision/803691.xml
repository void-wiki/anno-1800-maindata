          <Text>&lt;b&gt;"You always hear stories about poison dart frogs out here,"&lt;/b&gt; says one of the officers. He doesn't seem to know much more than that, except that in a 'Boy's Own' adventure story chloroform was used to treat frog poisoning. No-one seems to know where the medicine box is, but by the time it is found, someone has already succumbed to convulsions. It is only a slight relief then, that the chloroform does indeed relax the other victims sufficiently to keep their hearts beating. Time to leave this place.</Text>
