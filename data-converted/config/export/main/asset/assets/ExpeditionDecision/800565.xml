          <Text>&lt;b&gt;The hunters stumble guilelessly into its trap.&lt;/b&gt; The night is unfeasibly pitch, and the hunters' lamps extinguish. Who knows why, without a breath of wind? A scratching draws near. Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence.  Just like that, the fiend  has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed. </Text>
