          <Text>Alonso Graves is a man disturbed. A former soldier of empire, war transformed his soul forever. &lt;br/&gt;The disdain and misanthropy within him can only momentarily be silenced with the blood of his former masters. Believing himself now to be a god, he is intent on 'freeing' all he may from the shackles of human existence.</Text>
