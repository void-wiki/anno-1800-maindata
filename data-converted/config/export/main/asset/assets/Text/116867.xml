          <Text>For two years, Lady Jane Faithful has been preparing to find her husband's expedition, which got lost in the Arctic while looking for the Northwest Passage. She hopes you will agree to become the last and most crucial member of her rescue team, offering handsome rewards in exchange. But the journey will not be easy; if you don't want to meet the same fate as Sir John and his crew, you'd best prepare for a difficult expedition.</Text>
