Not only is Anno 1800 the seventh installment in the series, but it also marks the 20th anniversary for the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 years is a significant milestone to reach by any measure, but an especially notable one in an industry as dynamic and fast-paced as digital entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;</Text>
