          <Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;August 3rd, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir John has entrusted me, &lt;b&gt;Lt. Cdr. Remi Des Yeux&lt;/b&gt;, with the completion of his log, as he no longer has the strength to put pen to paper. Still, there can't be many more entries left for me to write. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are no longer killed by bears, but &lt;b&gt;have been lost days and weeks in high valleys&lt;/b&gt; that all look the same having lost our compass. We are now only six: Captain John Faithful; Sargent, the first mate; Little, an engineer; Hodgson, an assistant surgeon, Irving a ship's boy, and myself. The boy lives because he is a good lad, and none could suffer to eat of him. The bear meat never was going to last, you see. Sir John did have us swear never to speak of that shame, but who does he think we will tell?&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
