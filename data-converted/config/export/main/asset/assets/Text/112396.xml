          <Text>Dear friend, what you read in the news is true— Her Majesty is gone! My one consolation is that it seems by choice, for she left this parting note: "Don't fret, Archie dear. I'm off South to restore our imperial glory— will return when that's done". Please, can I trust you to ensure her safe return? I must remain here, to allay the chaos in her absence.</Text>
