          <Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;April 26th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have been forced to abandon HMS Styx and HMS Hades. Waited entire summer for the thaw, but weather gods are against us, and they are still stuck fast in the ice. I am certain we can still &lt;b&gt;find NW passage by foot&lt;/b&gt;, walking inland.&lt;br/&gt;Have filled two lifeboats with essential supplies to pull them over the snow like sleds. When we next find water it will be a passage to the east! And the lifeboats can row us to a safe haven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 4th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The men tire. Dragging two lifeboats perhaps ambitious, and they were stopping to rest at regular intervals.&lt;br/&gt;I have ordered that all remaining supplies be trusted to one of the lifeboats from now on, but now we have double the pulling power.&lt;br/&gt;Despite setbacks, morale is pretty good, and we &lt;b&gt;haven't lost any men&lt;/b&gt; since winter on Baffling island.&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
