          <Text>Lady Jane Faithful is convinced that her husband Sir John can still be found. His expedition went missing in the Arctic while seeking “The Passage” — a fabled shortcut to the far side of the world. The Arctic Council who commissioned the expedition seem to have given up all hope of finding survivors, but Lady Faithful hasn’t. Using her considerable influence and funds, she is employing the world’s best to embark on an exhaustive search of her own.</Text>
