          <Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 11th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are at a crossroads. To determine the best way forward, I sent a team led by Cdr. H. Sturgeon through the &lt;b&gt;canyon&lt;/b&gt; to the North. A second team led by Lt Cdr. R. Des Yeux went over the &lt;b&gt;snow dunes&lt;/b&gt; to the West. The last team led by Lt Cdr. E. Couch went towards deep &lt;b&gt;chasms&lt;/b&gt; in the East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 14th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;No team has yet returned.&lt;/b&gt; Camp supplies are becoming rather scarce, and there's little out here to hunt. I think we'd even gobble up those seals the Inuit offered us now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 16th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only two of the three teams have returned.&lt;/b&gt; I fear the worst has befallen Edgar Couch's menâ€” a risk we all took the day we volunteered. It's hard out here, cruel. The rest of us are to move without delay; their sacrifice will not be wasted if we make it.&lt;br/&gt;Cdr. Sturgeon reports that &lt;b&gt;his canyon tapered to a dead end&lt;/b&gt;. Des Yeux, God thank him, reports something more promising. &lt;b&gt;We will take the path he took.&lt;/b&gt; The ground looks too weak for the boat, but I'm sure we'll think of something, we always do.&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
