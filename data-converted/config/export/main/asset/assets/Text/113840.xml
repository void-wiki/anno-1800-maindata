          <Text>It is unseasonably, morbidly hot. A rowboat was found this morning, beached on the headland— brought on the current presumably, for its occupants are three days dead of thirst. In a clenched hand, a letter from Richardson; these men he sent to find help; the crew of the Ajax surviving a clash with the Santíssima Vitória only by swimming to an island southeast of the headland.&lt;br/&gt;We immediately dispatch a rescue boat, but it is too late: Richardson and his crew have met the same fate. We find no trace of the Santíssima Vitória either. His Majesty's reaction is predictable. These lives are on his hands, yet he weeps only for the sceptre.&lt;br/&gt;My wounds fester, and my fever worsens. The doctor says I must put down my pen.</Text>
