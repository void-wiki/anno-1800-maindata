          <Text>Now that we have a Zoo, wouldn't you like to have more wildlife around? I can only dream of what unknown species our expeditions may encounter, and I have heard a few menacing growls walking around Madame Kahina's Emporium... Oh, and I can definitely see some of our friends express their gratitude with pups if we do some things for them.</Text>
