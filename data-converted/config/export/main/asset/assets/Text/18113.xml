          <Text>Isabel Sarmento is the passionate leader of a rebellion in the New World people call "The Movement", striving for independence from Old World empires. &lt;br/&gt;She lost her brother to the violence, but this only seems to have strengthened her resolve. She knows her people will have to fight clever if they want to build a lasting future together.</Text>
