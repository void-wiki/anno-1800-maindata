          <Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;November 14th, 1847:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made camp on &lt;b&gt;King William Island&lt;/b&gt;, it shall shelter us for the winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;January 3rd, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Met a group of &lt;b&gt;Inuit&lt;/b&gt; to the Northwest. They were reluctant at first, but later approached us to trade for iron. They offered us dead seals, which o.c. we civilly declined —having enough fine canned food aboard Styx and Hades to last a lifetime— but instead they may know of a route to NW passage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 11th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inuit led us to a channel heading deeper into the ice. Inuit look worried, but our instruments report freeze is thinning by the day — time for our mighty &lt;b&gt;icebreakers&lt;/b&gt; to prove their prowess! Soon we shall be the first to cut the miracle shipping canal bridging East and West! We set out tomorrow. &lt;/i&gt;</Text>
