          <Text>Since the King will not now leave the safety of the fortress atop the cliffs, we may be able to blame the fog for not complying with his signals.&lt;br/&gt;There were other incidents today. At 3pm we intercepted two enemy gunboats, and ran them aground between two small islands to the Southeast, with cliffs like two guard dogs facing one another.&lt;br/&gt;At 4:30pm we discovered a frigate bearing the emblem of La Corona smuggling crates from a pirate cove amid the spiral-shaped cluster of islands that lie due east.&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, we had a skirmish with a ship-of-the-line near an old watchtower between the three large islands due west. She sank with all her cargo.</Text>
