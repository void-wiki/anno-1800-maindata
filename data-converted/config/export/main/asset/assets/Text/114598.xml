          <Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;June 21st, 1848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the warnings of these Inuit had worth. &lt;b&gt;The ice desert has been treacherous&lt;/b&gt;, and we have lost both men and equipment. I see darkness in the eyes of the living, now that their companions lie buried. If you knew that we are also at the end of our supplies, you might understand their anger. &lt;br/&gt;But they are loyal men, and know they cannot hope to survive alone. They will only challenge me if I admit defeat, and that I refuse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sheer mountain lies ahead.&lt;/b&gt; I have had to stifle my shock at its sudden appearance, and at the perilous climb we must now undertake, for morale among the men is already low. I would not appear in my right mind as their leader if I asked them to turn and face the horrors of the desert we had all thought behind us. No. &lt;b&gt;We climb.&lt;/b&gt; And meeting us at the summit, I believe, will be a view upon the shimmering water of a Northwest passage that shall sate the hunger. &lt;/i&gt;</Text>
