          <Text>Hannah encourages you to get things moving so the iron deposits can be reached. You should talk to the demolition expert and provide him with all the necessary details to get the job done. The demolition expert did not seem to take a liking to you and your sister. It makes Hannah wonder why, but she is glad he is willing to help us out. </Text>
