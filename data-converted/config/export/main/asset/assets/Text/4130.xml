          <Text>Hunt wants the player to escort a scientist who just made a "great discovery", the greatest discovery. Really. She will be able to save humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is afraid others might want to stop this or steal the knowledge/ideas, so asks for an escort just in case (do we spawn attackers?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe royale attackers? Or is this too direct?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She portrays the mission as "for the good of humanity", can't imagine anyone wanting to interfere - then there are a lot of attackers, makes the player wonder if intentions are good.</Text>
