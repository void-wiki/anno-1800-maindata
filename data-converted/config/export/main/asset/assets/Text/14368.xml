          <Text>Beryl O'Mara was a goodly soul once— back when she believed her meek shopkeeper husband would escape the debtor's prison. He didn't. &lt;br/&gt;Years later, and it is she running a street game, with the help of her many eyes and ears. She'll invite you in for tea, but don't get too cosy— that's a sawn-off under the floral tablecloth!</Text>
