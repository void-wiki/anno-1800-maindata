          <Text>Have a once-Pyrphorian flamethrower at close hand to light up that thing if it should return! I spent the afternoon hosing Musgrave's superior collection of cacti with flame. I don't suppose he'll mind now, Musgrave, but he failed my little test. How was I to know if it was the real him?&lt;br/&gt;I hear barking outside, yet all the huskies were dead! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  </Text>
