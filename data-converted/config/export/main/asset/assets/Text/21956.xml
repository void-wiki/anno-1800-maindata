          <Text>Then it was George who killed him... but everything else he writes I already knew. I always held him up as an example, my brother, of what I promised myself I would never be; unprincipled, a mercenary, a cruel and stupid sheep! To know what he was, it would have made mother so angry, so I told her Rafael had died a revolutionary, a hero, not the goon of a slave trader. Her face...she was so proud, so happy... I will write back to George right away! If anyone should apologise, it is me; for George's suffering on the plantations, for the suffering of his brothers and sisters, for the evils done them by people like my brother.</Text>
