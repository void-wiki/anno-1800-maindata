          <Text>An artisan got himself a bear cub and thought it would be hilarious to call it Black Beard and dress it up as a romantic pirate. The shy bear has outgrown the artisan's little workshop, and since it wouldn't stand a chance if you were to release it into the wild, Aarhant has suggested you build a comfortable enclosure for it on a Zoo.</Text>
