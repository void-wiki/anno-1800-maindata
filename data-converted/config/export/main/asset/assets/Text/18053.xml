          <Text>Vicente wants you to destroy a small trade ship containing street urchins he knows have stolen from him, even though the spoils of war they stole have already been moved on to one higher up the chain. Vicente seems to have given up on tracing this mastermind, and is content for you to take it out on those immediately responsible.</Text>
