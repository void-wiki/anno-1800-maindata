          <Text>Nathaniel Spoondrift, A.K.A. "Old Nate", is a drifter, opportunist and inventor. His life's work are his zeppelin, and the island at which it is moored— hodgepodges of parts he has spent years scrounging for. &lt;br/&gt;Aside from his mysterious employees, Nate rarely crosses paths with others— not unless they're willing to help him strip a corpse.</Text>
