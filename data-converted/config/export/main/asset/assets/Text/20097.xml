          <Text>Sir Archibald Blake is the steadfast counsel of Her Majesty the Queen. Optimistic, tactful and yet frequently awkward, good old Archie just wants everyone to get along. &lt;br/&gt;Years of diplomatic dinners have cultivated in him a great predilection for small talk, which can lead the unwary into believing he is not as wise as in fact, he truly is.</Text>
