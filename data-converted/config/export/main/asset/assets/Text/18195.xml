          <Text>Gasparov would like you to ensure a school of fragile ballerinas are kept safe from harm in transit to his conservatoire, where they are to enjoy a formal performance routine from the master himself. Gasparov hopes that through ballet, some connection to the grandeur of the past can be preserved, even in times of great change.</Text>
