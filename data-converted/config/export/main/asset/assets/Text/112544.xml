          <Text>La Corona opened fire this morning. We engaged in battle at 10am, southeast of the region, and it lasted until seven in the evening.&lt;br/&gt;We lost many good men todayâ€” the sly young Admiral Silva having deployed mines to protect the enemy convoy. It was the King's command that we attack in a single line, parallel to the enemy formation. Fortunately, I was able to persuade the fleet to ignore this instruction, and instead arrange themselves in two perpendicular columns to cut the enemy line, and as a corollary, avoid the mines. Still our lead ships were blown open, but it left a path clear for the rest of us. The enemy fleet, being snipped into thirds, were vulnerable to broadsides. We proceeded to drive them toward their own mines, and though in the mayhem there were casualties on both sides, we knew victory for the Empire had been won.&lt;br/&gt;We thank those brave sailors who lost their lives today that we ourselves survived, and shall never forget their sacrifice. The price would have been far greater had we sworn blind obedience to the King's strategy.</Text>
