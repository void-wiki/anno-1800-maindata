          <Text>Follow the Queen to Cape Trelawney; a new session with an immense continental island. Remarkable treasures are said to be buried in these waters— the remnants of a great sea battle. You're going to need a diving bell to get them— the newest invention of Old Nate, a nearby drifter. He'll also help turn any rubbish you find into inventions to fuel the growth of your territorial capital!</Text>
