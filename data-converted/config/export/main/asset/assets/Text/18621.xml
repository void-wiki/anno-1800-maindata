          <Text>I organised an exhibition in the honour of my late husband, Gilbard Hunt, may the Lord rest his soul. He was very fond of snakes and had a great interest on the venomous species found on the New World rainforests. Now that the exhibition is over, they should be returned to their original habitat unharmed.</Text>
