          <Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;August 7th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir John speaks again. He says the &lt;b&gt;silhouette of a great wolf&lt;/b&gt; came to him in his sleep, and that he wishes to meet us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our pack is down to three. Sir John, the boy Irving and me, Remi Des Yeux. We shall remember Sargent, Little and Hodgson. We shall remember the others who tripped and fell, who froze, who fell ill, who starved, who drowned, were maimed by bears, who slipped on high, or fell through the cracks. And we remember those who, when we ran out of food, drew the short straw...in vain! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a passage exists, we did not find it.&lt;/b&gt; But though he is mad, I will accompany Sir John to the end. The ferocious ship's boy Irving is our guardian spirit, the same who with superhuman strength, was able to fend off grown men in the snow who were after his legs for supper.&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
