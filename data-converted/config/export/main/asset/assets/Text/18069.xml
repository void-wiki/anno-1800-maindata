          <Text>...me old mum used to take good care of me when I was sick too. I remember those days in me straw bed, supping on stale—ah, crusty— bread, and gobbling down spoon after spoon of fish oil. Wonderful. Perhaps if you have any of the old stuff, I could give a little something back to the sick and needy, in honour of mum.</Text>
