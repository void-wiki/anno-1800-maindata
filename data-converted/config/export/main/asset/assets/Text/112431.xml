          <Text>You were too late. The second piece of the Sceptre of Capon has fallen into the hands of Vasco Oliveira. But, unlike his cousin Vicente, Oliveira prefers to settle matters without violence. He has proposed a deal: if you are the first to recover the last piece of the Sceptre — the Eagle— he will surrender the pommel. But if he gets to it first, you will have to hand over the rod section you found.</Text>
