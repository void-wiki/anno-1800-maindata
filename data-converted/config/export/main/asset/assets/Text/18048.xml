          <Text>Vicente's battalion has been awarded a medal by the King of La Corona, unfortunately due to the ongoing war effort at home, they could not afford to manufacture the medals to present them. Disgusted, Vicente asks you to bring the materials so that he can pin them on his men himself.</Text>
