          <Text>There is going to be a small skirmish. It's unavoidable but very winnable. If you were to take part, as a mercenary of course, it might give us the extra edge over those pathetic rebels. Of course you are a mercenary, you probably don't cae who you kill, so it may as well be for La Corona! </Text>
