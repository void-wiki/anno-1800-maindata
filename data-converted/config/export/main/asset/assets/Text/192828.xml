          <Text>This folder contains all pools used at the same time for trade pools, expedition pools and for quest reward pools. Please don't change them without keeping that in mind; Don't forget the item unlock; and don't include items that are supposed to be unique rewards for certain moments in the game. They are organized per rarity, per theme, and transversal pools for specific features are in "Additional Pools".</Text>
