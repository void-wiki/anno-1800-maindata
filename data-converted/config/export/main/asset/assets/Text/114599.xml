          <Text>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;June 30th, 1848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost my best man, Cdr. Sturgeon, in the mountains. Poor man was too anxious to prove me right. Some made it, but all hungry and desperate. You need shovel-loads to fuel your belly up here, and we have no food at all. There were grunts and growls in the night. &lt;b&gt;Either we eat the resident bears or they eat us.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
