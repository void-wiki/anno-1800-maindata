          <Text>&lt;br /&gt;Isabel, dear child. You have grown so much since first I met youâ€”  ferocious jaguar cub that you were. You had lost a brother, and I, a father. I had the years on my side back then, and the bounce of a freed man in my step. But I owe it to you to tell you, the price I paid for that freedom was high. I never found courage to tell you before now, but as the ever-quickening spectre of death approaches, I believe it is time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You always knew I had to be a runaway slave. Well, in order to escape the plantation, I had to kill a man. The one holding the whip. That man was your brother. I had to kill him to set us all free, a decision I have had to live with ever since, though I have to say, at the time I never saw it as a choice. I know, I came to you soon after, bearing the gift he intended for you, your name and his on the label, and I told you the lie that he'd died fighting in the resistance. I said he'd fought bravely against La Corona. The truth is, he was just a kid who'd fallen into the slave trade like so many others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well that's all. May you find it within yourself to forgive me for depriving you of your only brother. Either way, I shall continue to support you until I draw my last breath. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours, as ever, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. George Smith. </Text>
