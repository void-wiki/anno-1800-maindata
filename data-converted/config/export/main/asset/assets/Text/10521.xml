          <Text>Dear Governor Bleakworth,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More of the traitor Samuel’s conspirators. Crimes and sentences as follows;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ernest Sterling – Use of foul language – 16 years with hard labour.&lt;br/&gt;Verity Goodheart – Impersonation – Transportation to the Antipodes.&lt;br/&gt;Elias Noble – Writing a threatening letter – Life imprisonment&lt;br/&gt;Honora Decent – Character assassination – Life imprisonment&lt;br/&gt;The judge saw very well my view, that any lack of proof they conspired with a traitor was, in itself, evidence they hide something. All things considered, his verdict could have been far worse. While I am under no obligation to explain such details, I thought that as a fellow dispenser of justice, the facts of the case may be of interest to you.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sincerely&lt;br/&gt;Edvard Goode&lt;br/&gt;(Edvard) Goode &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;</Text>
