          <Text>I have today begun the process of gathering evidence in my defence. Hannah was here, though they did not let her stay long. She gives me hope that a full and unmitigated pardon is possible. Years of loyalty count in my favour, but the very idea that I may have betrayed my Queen weighs heavily upon me. Even if the dark clouds of scandal pass, they may forever have damaged our familyâ€™s prospects.</Text>
