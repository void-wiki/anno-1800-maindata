          <Text>With daybreak comes clarity. Prosperity was sold to the infamous rebel “Sarmento” – and I must be the last to have heard of it! The Queen, the nation, is up in arms, that the jewel of the new world is lost! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guards, from whom I heard all, thought me playing some trick! Yet it is I who am tricked; duped of my island by persons unknown! Although it can only be the same persons that came to me one ominous day, masked and embroidered with eldrich symbols. They pressed me towards a sale. But I shut the door hard I tell you, and bid them good-day!</Text>
