          <Text>My baby Black Bear used to be so adorable, with his eye patch and his buccaneer bicorn. Who would have thought that tiny cub would grow into such a magnificent beast! I love him with all my heart, but there is just not enough room for him at my humble workshop... Give him the life he deserves, I beg of you.</Text>
