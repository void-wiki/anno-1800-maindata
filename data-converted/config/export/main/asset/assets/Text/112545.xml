          <Text>The King is indeed mad. He appears to care nothing for our victory, and was upset in the extreme to learn that we hadn't yet begun pursuit of the Santíssima Vitória, for he is adamant that the Sceptre of Capon is aboard.&lt;br/&gt;Having received word that the flagship was heading northeast, His Majesty ordered our Captain Richardson — of the HMS Ajax — to go after her. Under no circumstances will he permit us to accompany them. I have tried to inform the King that the Ajax is ill-equipped for the duel, but my injury leaves me weak, and I have had to retire to my quarters. Santíssima Vitória may be the largest man-of-war ever built. Richardson knows he leads his men to their deaths, but he has always been a man unswerving in his sense of duty.</Text>
