          <Text>Admiral Vicente Silva is an experienced, calculating and humourless conqueror. His noble upbringing, and education at the finest military academies has primed him for a life in power. &lt;br/&gt;A staunch traditionalist, his conviction is that the crumbling empire of La Corona in whose service he profits, will prevail against a world in rebellion.</Text>
