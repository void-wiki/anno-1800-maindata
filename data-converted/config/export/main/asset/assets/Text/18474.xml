          <Text>I want to build a public library. You know in the old days, books were the most expensive thing imaginable, accessible only to the few. Times have changed and books are cheaper now. But not cheap enough! I want them to be free, free for anyone to come and pick up as they please, to read whatever they please. </Text>
