          <Text>La Corona’s fleet is vast in size and number, but ours staffed with seamen both seasoned and loyal. We have a chance of winning a decisive victory against the enemy here at Trelawney — but not if we fixate on recovering the sceptre, as the King is insisting... I admit, taking the talisman would greatly damage La Corona's national spirit, but what of our own?— when a thousand or more sailors are sent to their deaths for a trinket! No, we must have no other thought than employing the best tactics to win the day.</Text>
