          <Text>Dr. Mercier used to be a respectable dental practitioner before he became the leader of an anarchist regime. You either see eye to eye with him, or you are an ally of his oppressors, there is no middle ground... But if he agrees to trade with us, we may get access to some very unique merchandise on his trading post.</Text>
