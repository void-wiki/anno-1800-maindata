I do miss the thrill of my old life in my moments like these.","9814":"Someone I used to know is running from authorities. She needed to get rid of a few pieces of evidence, and notified me where she left them. I am afraid I have to provide them to the authorities, she should have been more careful.

While small requests like these annoy me, take my word for it when I tell you the importance of gaining people's respect and keeping them close. ","9816":"I have always been a role-model citizen, so there is nothing to compensate for, but from time to time, I donate things I can miss so they end up with those needing them.","9817":"Friends from back home are paying me a visit. These are the type of people at the very top of society, used to nothing but the best. They surely expect a proper escort.

The kind that feels too important to travel without escort.","9819":"I have a very expensive shipment coming in soon. The value is likely beyond what you can imagine. Point is, it is the kind of shipment one does not allow to travel unguarded.","9820":"This lord claims he no longer purchases from me because he is too afraid of pirates to send his ships into the region.

managed to muddle through.","250065":"Fustilarian flea! Waste someone else's time!","250066":"No wonder your name is mud.","250067":"Dream of wide blue horizons? Apply within!","250068":"It feels special doing a good deed!","250069":"Oh really, you're as naughty as the children.","250070":"Failing is the only way we learn!","250072":"Some find it titillating to serve. Is that you?","250073":"My little errand boy, back with a happy face.","250074":"You drop from the flesh before feeding is done...","250075":"Humans are flawed.","250076":"We doubled our efforts!","250077":"Desperate to make something of yourself, I see.","250078":"On your head be it.","250079":"Your followers have nowhere to sleep, old pal!","250080":"So many are still loyal. But, will you stay loyal to them?","250081":"Wherever we've been, there was one constant: a marketplace. Where's yours?","250082":"Merchants, barter, pickpockets... The atmosphere improves already!","250083":"We've travelled often without roads, but don't deprive your people that comfort.","250084":"Much better to travel on.","250085":"If you want goods to reach their destinations, have them sprout wings! Or, lay roads.","250086":"I see you've chosen the down-to-earth approach, well done.","250087":"The railway could be a wonderful invention, if used right. Let's see how you do, old pal.","250088":"Curious, how close the distant is now.","250089":"Everything always starts with wood. Yet no production in sight here?","250090":"Saws are loud, but effective. You won't catch me near there.","250091":"I am unsure of these bags of meat, but that won't stop your people craving them.","250092":"Sausage is unsightly, but high in demand.","250093":"It's not for me, but strong drink is part of your culture. So, isn't something missing?","250094":"There is cheering on the streets. I suppose it was a good move.","250095":"Oh the stench! Won't you give your people something to wash themselves with?","250096":"A relief for my nostrils. Others feel the same, I can tell.","250097":"Have you forgotten all about life in land, old pal? Farmers need fields to sow!","250098":"CHANGE: So you do remember the basics.","250099":"It is your duty to care for the animals you keep. Why are they not given enough space?","250100":"Animals are God's creation. This should do right by them.","250101":"People here wash their clothes in wash houses, do they not? Where are those houses?","250102":"Fascinating gossip! All while meeting to wash clothes.","250103":"People here like to talk and drink. Give them a place to do it, not the streets!","250104":"Your people are lively every day of the week.","250105":"A mere spark can start a blaze! You might not want to think on that, but be at least prepared.","250106":"Let us hope it will never come to it again.","250107":"If only you had a material that could withstand storms and fires. If only!","250108":"I am proud you've figured out this secret material.","250109":"Do you want the people to go to work in their nightgowns? They need proper clothes for it!","250110":"Much better. Although the alternative would have been amusing.","250111":"Something the matter, old pal? You've almost revived your father's business, yet you hesitate.","250112":"You've come a long way.","250180":"Here's something even you can handle.","250181":"You can serve as the soot-stained stoker aboard my runaway train!","250182":"It's deeply trivial, but I dare say that won't bother you.","250183":"See how magnanimous I am, giving you work.","250184":"Don't keep me waiting.","250185":"It's an honour to serve a von Malching.","250187":"Not bad. I might use you again.","250188":"Are you sure that's everything? Very well.","250189":"Good, now scurry back to the sewer.","250190":"Now watch as I rake it all in!","250191":"Scrimshank pleb! Don't expect any favours from me.","250192":"Fluffed it? You zestless zounderkite!","250193":"Don't give me fimble-fambles, I deal in results.","250194":"What can possibly be the delay?","250195":"I'll have perished at this rate.","250196":"Where are you, dung-sifter?","250197":"Butter upon bacon, I have more for you …","250198":"There's no end to the profits in this.","250199":"I see a glimmer in this pan yet...","250200":"Surely you want to distance yourself from that simpleton?","250201":"Clearly not as distinguished a responsibility as this…","250229":"Von Malching is the name on everyone's lips at society gatherings.","250230":"I'd dress as your grandmother if it meant I could lay hands on your lovely lucre!","250231":"My business is other people's money. Your money, to be exact.","250232":"I shall capitalise on this.","250233":"Such juicy prospects.","250234":"Fizzing!","250235":"Very good for me.","250236":"The promise is ravishing!","250237":"That's good gravy!","250238":"Greatly to my advantage.","250239":"So, you can be useful.","250241":"I loathe to admit it, but you've done well.","250242":"Impressive, what's your secret? Not that I need it.","250243":"If you're happy with mediocre, then I'm happy too.","250244":"Well, bully for you!","250245":"Not entirely feeble. Not strong, but not feeble.","250246":"You might just be the best of a bad set.","250247":"I am vexed.","250248":"Confound this blasted matter.","250249":"This has upset my plans!","250250":"Absurd, I won't have it!","250251":"Nooooooooo!","250252":"Inconceivable!","250253":"What the devil?!","250257":"I expect no less, from a bluebottle.","250258":"Whenever it rains, you worm to the surface.","250262":"Your family crest is seething with rot!","250263":"You remind me of my father, spineless!","250264":"You handle this business like a guttersnipe.","250265":"You dare deny the cat his milk!","250266":"Your actions betray your commonness.","250267":"You're yet another mangy travelling circus, here today, gone tomorrow.","250269":"Don't expect me to shake your disease-ridden hand.","250272":"You, is it.","250274":"Oh I'm sorry, have we met?","250275":"Another interruption. Better be worth it.","250276":"What a deep voice I have. All the better to greet you with!","250277":"Want something, or simply admiring my realms?","250278":"Stumbling into the lion's jaws?","250279":"Good, then you know where the door is.","250280":"Don't loiter, you'll depreciate the value of this neighbourhood!","250282":"Keen to experience the dizzying razzle-dazzle of city life?","250283":"Ever seen a finer example than this? Of course you haven't.","250284":"Look upon the majesty, and weep.","250285":"Wish you had a vessel this stately do you?","250286":"I don't mind losing the odd sailor, as long as they bring in the bounty.","250287":"I associate boats with treasure.","250288":"We're looking for a deck-scrubber, since you like boats so much.","250289":"I deserve this.","250290":"Capital.","250291":"Bang up to the elephant.","250292":"Oh if I must.","250293":"Only because it suits me.","250294":"Alright.","250295":"An emphatic no!","250296":"Certainly not!","250297":"Has the world gone loopy?","250301":"The brutes are rich, and the meek impoverished, all is as it should be in the world!","250302":"My factories use every part of the pig but the squeal. Squeamish workers can be found other situations!","250303":"I sometimes feel for the little people; too busy working to earn any money.","250304":"I held a modest function for society's distinguished. A five-course dinner, a masquerade, a forty-piece orchestra, rose petals billowing from the rafters. Maybe I'll invite you next time, but then... maybe not.","250305":"Some were born, silver spoon in mouth. Once I'd wrenched it from father's feeble grasp that is.","250306":"Miss Jorgensen is an intriguing creature. Naïve, but of good blood. Once she replies to my offer of marriage, we shall breed children of ambition and status.","250307":"Since Miss Qing is rather new, I'll show her the lay of the land. Then have first dibs on her eastern fortune!","250308":"Beryl O'Mara clings to society like a leech. Her chief of police should arrest her where she stands.","250309":"Why do they celebrate that fop Gasparov at the club? All he does is blither about buttresses!","250310":"Why is it prattlers like Wibblesock are always so insistent?! Does the dratted imbecile never sleep?!","250311":"George Smith's hard life, blah-blah-blah. Haven't I had to struggle!? A name in tatters, and yet now, across everybody's lips!","250313":"Graves?! The mutation? The model of maleficence?! The ripper who robbed the barber?","250314":"Vicente Silva has had an easy life; anybody in his boots would have succeeded. I meanwhile, rise to prominence on merit!","250315":"When Lady Hunt invited me in for afternoon tea, I felt an unspoken bond between us. Sophistication!","250316":"The Queen is fond of me, and vice-versa. But her administration is a scandal! I demand a barony!","250317":"Archie Blake is a sniveller. He somehow cosied up to the Queen, and has remained an obsequious parasite ever since.","250324":"We won't shake on it, you probably spit on your hands.","250325":"I pity you, is why I indulge you.","250326":"I'm a philanthropist.","250327":"Trade can be so demeaning.","250328":"And despite a yawning gulf in status.","250329":"Noblesse oblige!","250330":"Regard my largesse!","250361":"My lavish offer.","250362":"Take it or leave it.","250363":"It's as low as I will stoop.","250364":"Read while I floss my moustache.","250365":"Me at my most generous.","250366":"You don't deserve better than this …","250367":"Don't waste my time with counter-offers!","250368":"I am a wolf, and you, a sheep come to dinner.","250369":"I'll scrape off your carapace you wood weevil!","250370":"I long to burst you like a bubo.","250371":"I have you between my fat palms ready to squish.","250372":"Quite reasonable, considering ...","250373":"Don't mind if I do.","250374":"What a steal!","250375":"See! I'm no miser!","250376":"A most favourable result.","250377":"Putrescent pinchfist!","250378":"And sign my life away?!","250379":"You stiff-neck scrooge!","250380":"A scandalous offer!","250381":"Skinflint!","250382":"I'll be the one who does the exploiting!","250383":"The fat needs trimming.","250384":"As I want it, or not at all…","250385":"You deranged rhinoceros!","250386":"This deal is good for me in any case.","250387":"Meal-mouth fitch.","250388":"I've seen scarier chipmunks.","250389":"Please, don't make me laugh!","250390":"What will you do? Pepper me with haberdasher's buttons?","250391":"You'll appreciate this.","250392":"Let me help you.","250393":"Here's charity.","250394":"No need to thank me.","250395":"And they say I'm unkind...","250396":"Well, what did you expect?!","250397":"Eat humble pie.","250398":"You pushed me to this.","250399":"You deserve even worse.","250400":"Let me put you in your place.","250401":"I wage war against you and your pigeon-liver plebs.","250402":"A war with you is a surefire investment.","250403":"House von Malching goes to war!","250404":"This war is a waste of time for both of us.","250405":"What if I were to let you off the hook?","250406":"Better let you catch your breath.","250407":"Towel off the sweat while you may.","250408":"It will help your exiguous business along.","250409":"I don't expect this favour will be repaid.","250410":"You would be joining an elite club.","250411":"You never had anything I needed.","250412":"We always throw your junk into the sea.","250413":"Why I degraded myself to your level...!","250418":"Who would decline a match with a von Malching?","250419":"A most illustrious alliance, surely?","250420":"I am so tired of pretending to care about you.","250421":"We are patently not on the same footing.","250427":"Take it. I hardly need it.","250428":"Had it coming out of my ears - wax free, of course.","250429":"Here is a token gift.","250435":"I'm here if ever you need a steady, albeit somewhat arthritic, hand to guide you.","250436":"Sir Archibald Blake, Her Majesty's moist mouthpiece!","250437":"One-piece underwear suits? Too prickly! I find singleton shorts and vests to be tried and true!","250438":"For once something you've done makes sense.","250439":"That's not a terrible idea.","250440":"Oh, yes...","250441":"Most promising.","250442":"Surprisingly shrewd ...","250443":"Vagabond!","250444":"Tatterdemalion!","250445":"A bold-faced swindle!","250446":"The impudence!","250447":"A low-life move.","250448":"By Jove, you're a maniac!","250449":"Your paper tigers will be blown to the winds.","250450":"War? All too obvious, you sneeze-lurking snake.","250451":"Finally worked out who's best?","250452":"I suppose I could spare you ...","250453":"I could have batty-fanged you to bits.","250454":"Yes, I do think you need time to recuperate.","250455":"Fine, though I doubt you have anything tradeworthy.","250456":"I keenly await your first shipment of soiled 'k'chiefs.","250457":"Trade with you? Lucky me.","250458":"No more of your junk? Say it's not true!","250459":"Finally we can be rid of your detritus!","250460":"Yes, go back to the foot of the pyramid.","250465":"Certainly I can be a friend, at least on paper.","250466":"Dry your eyes, I will be your ally.","250467":"Weaselling your way out?","250468":"Sloping your shoulders?","250475":"More money is always good.","250476":"Never look a gift donkey in the chops.","250479":"Weird and wonderful!","250482":"I'm sure ma'am shall be delighted!","250483":"Superlative!","250484":"Suitably regal!","250485":"Her Majesty might approve!","250486":"Comforting as a moist and springy sponge!","250487":"Well that certainly settles the stomach!","250489":"You're a credit to the Empire!","250490":"You're constant, and that is key!","250491":"Perhaps a peerage is on the cards?","250492":"Majesty will soon be mentioning you.","250493":"I knew you'd come through!","250494":"You're flourishing!","250495":"You're a national treasure!","250496":"Her Majesty will be discomfited…","250497":"There's an unpleasant waft in the air.","250498":"Heavens, what shall I tell her majesty?","250499":"Oh, horsefeathers.","250500":"This brings on my indigestion.","250501":"I'm suddenly hot under the collar.","250502":"Pshaw, I shan't sleep at all.","250503":"You put me in a difficult position…","250504":"I wouldn't wish to accuse you of disloyalty…","250505":"Perhaps think again on the situation?","250506":"I fear you've made things awkward…","250507":"Might I advise against your current course?","250508":"Now we don't want to have a contretemps.","250509":"It's not that we don't trust you entirely…","250511":"I present my humble duty to you, and am confident you'll transcend your present circumstance!","250512":"I am a humble servant of Her Majesty, called upon for delicate occasions such as these.","250513":"Taking the initiative - excellent!","250514":"What a jolly jolly surprise.","250515":"Ah yes, the bright young sapling!","250516":"I present my humble duty to you.","250517":"Don't tell me I've missed another appointment?","250518":"Sir Archibald Blake, how may I serve?","250519":"Anyone for croquet?","250520":"I've always dreamed of being loathed!","250521":"Au contraire! There is nothing more in fashion than the monocle!","250522":"Your guttural babble sloshes like water off a duck's back!","250523":"The wayward jabs of your sabre are foiled by your lack of poise.","250524":"What sticky drippy honey goop!","250525":"Damn liberal! Control your peculiar thoughts!","250526":"What a fawning cod you have turned out to be.","250527":"Your toadyism is thoroughly nauseating!","250528":"Lies and slander! My wife died in a curricle accident!","250529":"I am nothing like my idiot father! You calumniating imp!","250530":"What's wrong with my moustache?!","250531":"Oh, yes. Couldn't have said it better myself.","250532":"Thank you! Pleasingly round isn't it?","250533":"Very true! They are extremely shiny.","250534":"I know your game of billiards, but don't let me stop you.","250538":"I'm glad of our trade, most are too dazzled by me to even approach.","250539":"I rarely circulate among minnows, yet we've done a few deals.","250540":"The little piglet that keeps coming back to the teat, its adorable.","250541":"We prepare for the worst but hope for the best.","250542":"Our humble little Empire.","250543":"The King is dead, long live the Queen!","250544":"The street layout was positively Byzantine until recent times.","250545":"I AM a real baron, I tell you!","250546":"Her Majesty's finest!","250547":"A lustrous jewel in the crown!","250548":"Every ship needs a stiff rudder!","250549":"An Empire covers both land AND sea!","250550":"Ma'am and I are much obliged!","250551":"A royal acknowledgement is due!","250552":"Sir Archibald gives his thanks.","250553":"Naturally!","250557":"But of course!","250559":"Oh, most assuredly!","250572":"I bought some of your island. The door was open, and I ambled through.","250573":"Hardly worth investing in your island, but then, it won't be yours for long.","250574":"A delicious morsel. Soon I shall have the lion's share.","250575":"It can be mine now. All mine.","250576":"I have so many grand plans for it…","250577":"A completely insignificant island, no wonder you're so keen to buy!","250578":"You can afford to tussle for my island? Perhaps I underestimated you.","250579":"Only a fastidious cove thinks they can buy their way in!","250580":"You think you've outmanoeuvred me!","250581":"Defraud me of an entire island?!","250582":"Sad you lack the acumen to see the potential of this land.","250583":"What kind of apple-polisher gives up an island?","250586":"You only have it because I let you have it!","250587":"You do the hard work developing it, and then I'll take it back.","250590":"You philistine! All my hard work gone from that island.","250591":"You erased every trace of von Malching from it?! Savage!","250592":"Razed every brick I laid? You are possessed by sadistic demons!","250593":"I fear that may be impossible.","250594":"The thought makes me wince!","250595":"Oh my aching organs, no.","250596":"As a boy, I was chased through the palace by a disgruntled goose, honking and hissing! I had its egg, you see. Once I'd given it back, the goose and I became firm friends.","250597":"Tolerance, sympathy, understanding. Supreme qualities in a monarch wishing for a happy reign.","250598":"Her Majesty rarely needs guidance - ah, a little here and there - I think she simply likes to have my company.","250599":"Ever carved a lovespoon from walnut? I did have an amour once, but matters of state drew us apart.","250600":"As Her Majesty's adjutant, I must be quietly attentive. The merest smile on her face is enough!","250601":"Viscount Guffington-Hawkmoth, wounded at his own estate. It brings to light Her Majesty's very present vulnerability.","250602":"Bless Her Majesty, she eats so fast, but when she stops, so must we!","250605":"Her Majesty's rare gift is a soft heart and a hard mind. With monarchs, it is too often the reverse!","250606":"Anne Harlow's fall from grace was stormy and unpleasant, a bit like my bowels.","250607":"George Smith has a marvellous walking cane of alder, with tasteful silver flourishes.","250608":"Aha...Jean La Fortune. We'd like to have helped, but it's rather gone beyond that now.","250609":"Isabel Sarmento? You should probably be careful where you speak that name.","250610":"Mr. Bleakworth may seem a blinkered horse, but is very well-suited to his task at the prison.","250611":"When running errands for Her Majesty, I often find myself in Madame Kahina's exquisite company.","250612":"Miss Jorgensen is a far relation of Her Majesty, if I'm not mistaken. They do both share a certain boldness...","250613":"We have made every conceivable dispensation for Princess Qing, as we are compelled to do with visiting royalty!","250614":"We auditioned this Wibblesock for Her Majesty's fifteenth birthday, sadly the rabbit didn't survive the hat.","250615":"Beryl O'Mara has flies on the wall, as I only dream our own discrete services might.","250616":"Her Majesty wearies of Mr. von Malching's pinguid claims to a non-existent barony.","250617":"I worry Artur Gasparov might one day appear at the palace better-dressed than her majesty.","250620":"I'll smithereen you!","250621":"Lowly cur!","250622":"Have at you, devil-dog!","250623":"I'm positively bristling!","250624":"I am suddenly violent!","250625":"You wild beast!","250626":"You vindictive menace!","250627":"Your fleet is a rabble!","250628":"Plebs are not at liberty to joust!","250629":"Knave!","250630":"Oh dear, did your stock plummet?","250631":"I shall sweep your wreck for treasure!","250632":"Your tin-pot tars left clinging to driftwood!","250633":"That ship cost me an arm and a leg!","250634":"My ship! You electric eel!","250635":"Where did you find such firepower?","250636":"I should have charged the spectators!","250637":"It gave way so easily!","250638":"Have you any idea how much that cost?","250639":"That will be sickeningly expensive to replace!","250640":"Look at my winning smile!","250641":"It's my island now. Time to exploit the dissidents!","250642":"Oh no. Looks like I've trampled over you on my way to the top of the pile.","250643":"Nowhere left to run for the von Malching line. Be my surrogate, show them all... how to run a cut-throat business.","250644":"They were a valued business associate!","250645":"Don't rub out my allies! They could be useful!","250646":"You take care of my enemies, and I'll make mountains.","250647":"Yes, you create a distraction while I fill my pockets.","250648":"I had you down as a lily-livered waif.","250649":"Rash. You almost have my respect.","250650":"A military gambit now?","250651":"Yes. Better to send your plebs to war.","250652":"I hear your officers call you 'pipsqueak'.","250653":"Playing tin soldiers?","250654":"You polish your blunderbuss like a pimpled cadet.","250655":"The bluster of a shoe-laced ruffian.","250656":"Honour our agreement, drive back these scoundrels!","250657":"You would not dare renege on our pact!?","250658":"Come at the drop of a hat? Only if I get a share of the spoils.","250659":"This feels like a first for me; honouring a deal I made.","250660":"Foxed your way into my hole!? Where's my rifle?","250661":"You'll soon be back here before a firing squad!","250662":"Enough meaningless talk, let's see how rich you are in a duel!","250663":"My slick sailors will string yours from their sails!","250664":"One fish in the vast school that will bring you to your patchwork knees!","250665":"These majestic cannons will shred your rag-tag sails.","250666":"Pure pleasure …","250667":"All in Her Majesty's name.","250668":"More flexible than you imagined!","250669":"The royal seal upon it!","250670":"I can finally let go that pent-up gas!","250671":"Customs and excise, eh!","250672":"Duty done, time for a kip!","250673":"Pull up your braces, and thrust into the unknown!","250674":"If you pop off now, you'll be back in time for tennis!","250675":"Know that any assistance may influence Her Majesty's sphere!","250676":"Alas, my bowels churn afresh and I must beg your expertise...","250677":"Now here is a vital matter, of Queen and country!","250678":"Brute force?! A fearful determination.","250679":"You didn't play fair! This wretched life is never fair.","250680":"Righty-ho!","250681":"Jolly Roger!","250682":"Buckaroo!","250683":"That really is first-rate.","250684":"I am quite penetrated by your kindness.","250685":"Bish-bang-bibbly, there she blows!","250686":"Ideally, one should keep one's promises.","250687":"Now, now. You oughtn't waste people's time.","250688":"Didn't finish? Ah. Um…hmmn…","250689":"Failed? I feel a ghastly surge coming on.","250690":"Caught trousers down? Happens to the best of us!","250708":"Her Majesty has little patience, I'd skip to it if I were you!","250709":"Have you heard the expression, 'a stitch in time saves nine' …","250710":"Resting? Perhaps you'd like my latest; male torso in rosewood!","250711":"Much has moved since we spoke, but I can still count on you?","250712":"I fear I must call upon you again, in spite of your good work.","250713":"I confess these unseemly troubles gurgle on, hope you don't mind?","250714":"Loyalty to the crown really should come above all else …","250715":"Only Her Majesty has your best interests at heart.","250829":"(WIP) Please do something! Many houses are already burning!","250830":"(WIP) Aarhant is happy about having additional fire station.","250978":"(WIP) Please do something! Many people are rioting in the streets!","250979":"(WIP) Well done! The streets should be more secure now!","250980":"(WIP) Please do something! Many people are ill!","250981":"(WIP) Well done! The doctors are already on their way!","250988":"Perhaps it'll mean journeying to the centre of the earth!","250989":"I just know you'll give for a worthy cause!","250990":"There's fun to be found in everything, even quests!","250991":"Exploooooore this!","250992":"I feel better already!","250993":"You are too kind!","250994":"What can I say but thank you!","250995":"Upon my stars, I never doubted you!","250996":"The happiest possible thing!","250997":"The Jorgensen Trust couldn't be more grateful!","250998":"It's every person's right to change their mind!","250999":"A lost world! Oh well.","251000":"Next time will be more than perfect!","251001":"If the whole business is too much, just say!","251002":"We should never give up, even when things are really bad!","251003":"Don't worry, I know you have a fine conscience!","251004":"I know which summit we can scale next!","251005":"Such sublime co-operation merits further exploration!","251006":"So many more miracles to be weaved!","251007":"There's always another way!","251008":"It's so nice to have a choice!","251009":"A new world!? I will turn every stone in every stream!","251010":"Oh yes pick me! We'll explore distant lands, sing songs and press singular flowers!","251011":"Aren't you just itching to leap into the beyond?","251012":"A magic carpet ride!","251013":"I'm over the sky, moon and stars!","251014":"I am inconceivably excited!","251015":"Dashed wonderful!","251016":"Quite Extraordinary!","251017":"Splendiferous!","251018":"Magnifico!","251019":"You are incomparable!","251020":"You're wonderful, magical!","251021":"You're the example to us all!","251022":"How I knew I could trust you!","251023":"I want to be exactly like you!","251024":"You can always be relied upon to do the right thing!","251025":"You're positively positive!","251026":"Oh no, how unspeakably awful!","251027":"A sunny disposition can see me through.","251028":"It only seems gloomy.","251029":"This is still a dreadful shock.","251030":"Only good can come of this, surely.","251031":"I shouldn't feel bad when there are orphans in the world.","251032":"I'm sure I can explain this to the trustees.","251090":"I could never be angry with you.","251091":"You... old fossil.","251092":"You... dinosaur.","251093":"I promise I'm not at all cross with you.","251094":"I'm quite certain you don't mean to offend.","251095":"I'm trying to put myself in your shoes.","251096":"You had no choice, I'm absolutely sure.","251097":"Nice to meet you! I've just returned from my expedition. I'm Bente Jorgensen, chairlady of the Jorgensen Foundation.","251098":"I'm delighted to meet you! I'm Bente Jorgensen, chairlady of the Jorgensen Foundation. I can't wait to work with you!","251099":"Oh isn't it a wonderful day?!","251100":"By Jove hello you!","251101":"Just finished cataloguing the little butterflies!","251102":"You simply must want tea!","251103":"Oh do tell of your adventures!","251104":"We are so lucky to have a visitor!","251105":"Funny, I just this minute came through the door myself!","251106":"The trustees are only too happy to help with town planning!","251107":"You've unearthed one of my buildings, how fascinating!","251108":"There's always room for all at my inn!","251109":"The Jorgensen Trust gives the people the means to help themselves!","251110":"I'm so grateful to the charitable donations that made this ship possible.","251111":"What a thrill to adventure upon the open sea!","251112":"I shall never take the wonder of discovery for granted!","251113":"Tremendous fun to dispense with dignity, and become a sailor!","251114":"Bless, bless, bless!","251115":"I am utterly humbled!","251116":"Profound thanks on behalf of the Jorgensen Trust.","251117":"Oh I can't wait!","251118":"Oh yes, how marvellous!","251119":"By all means!","251120":"I wish I could but I can't.","251121":"Usually I would!","251122":"Only my advisors disagree!","251123":"How can display cabinets do justice to the four corners? From Ammonites to Zooplankton we must fire the imagination!","251124":"I travelled the world with my father. He may be gone, but he'd be glad to see my curiosity remains.","251125":"The Jorgensen Trust only doubt my ability, because they've not see the proposal in full! Profit is no longer the mission, only joy!","251126":"The Jorgensen dynasty dates back at least as far as the early 15th century. Evidence suggests we are a warm-hearted clan!","251127":"Read boustrophedon in the dark on a stormy sea, and then tell me anything isn't possible!","251128":"Oh? I've never seen George grumpy, he's such a caring man with so many remarkable stories!","251129":"If I could only paint in words like Princess Qing! But we're such good friends I get to hear every poem!","251130":"You just saved my next excursion!","251131":"Never mind silly money, it's for friendship!","251132":"See, I can be a good trader!","251133":"Thank you gentle merchant.","251134":"I hope that's really helpful!","251135":"I'm so glad you never cheat me.","251136":"Wonderful how trade brings people together!","251268":"If this goes zigzag, just remember, you put Wibbly here - you'd better get Wibbly out!","251269":"I'll probably get a terrible start; islands riddled with snakes, or pirates - that'd be ruddy typical.","251270":"Only wibblyists call me a soft target! And I've suffered enough Wibblyism to bow to it now.","251272":"Here's the sort of caper I had, when first starting out…","251273":"Finally, a smidge of lady luck!","251274":"I'm gonna burst like balloon-juice!","251275":"That's proper tidy!","251276":"Now we're parlaying!","251277":"Abracadabrangles!","251278":"The legend of Wibblesock lives on!","251279":"Then there was nothing to be afraid of!","251280":"You're learnin'!","251281":"You've only gone and done it!","251282":"You've wowed Wibbly, you 'ave.","251283":"Hey now, don't be sad, you've come a long way.","251284":"Takes a lot to impress me, y'know.","251285":"My board send their thanks - did you do summat good?","251286":"We need talents like you on the stage!","251287":"King's codpiece, what now?!","251288":"I've had nought but knocks all my life.","251289":"My luck just goes from bad to worse.","251290":"This is bloomin' unfair!","251291":"It's the worst kind of wibblyism!","251292":"This is giving me the morbs.","251293":"No! Oh come off it!","251294":"I hope this agreement agreeable!","251295":"Ought really to have asked my advisors first!","251296":"I'm bursting with ideas!","251297":"This has to be the start of something special!","251298":"Isn't negotiation thrilling!","251299":"A wonderful opportunity for change!","251300":"A proposal!","251301":"Oh come on, not you as well!","251302":"Don't forget it was me what put you on the map!","251303":"You're a blatant wibblyist!","251304":"Ingratitude, that’s your vice!","251305":"Why d'you have to be like that?!","251306":"The board told me to get angry with you.","251307":"You've let yerself, yer family, and worst of all, me down.","251308":"Willie Wibblesock, self-made man — no shame in it. Wibbly if you like —  how it'll be in the fairy tales.","251309":"Nouveaus arrivees' like wise old Wibbly here? Stick by me and you'll come good!","251310":"What cheer with you?","251311":"Hello me old chuckaboo.","251312":"Don't startle me like that!","251313":"I get enough rapping at my window at night!","251314":"A wibbly-wobbly welcome!","251315":"Here you is!","251316":"Who summons the Grand Panjandrum?!","251317":"Seasonal felicitations, Guv'nor.","251318":"Alright old bean?","251319":"Welcome to the inner sanctum!","251320":"Look at that majestic building, whatever it is!","251321":"I built that with my own hands, in a way.","251322":"Never knew that was there until now!","251323":"Ooh is that mine too?","251324":"I was wondering where that naughty ship'd got to!","251325":"Hang on a minute, isn't that one of mine?","251326":"The sea breeze. Can't you feel the shrimps?","251327":"They say it's bad luck if I'm aboard, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.","251328":"I'm actually quite cross.","251329":"My advisors don't appear to like you.","251330":"I learned intimidation from camels.","251331":"Are you ready for my haka dance?!","251332":"Thank me lucky stars.","251333":"You beauty!","251334":"Well I never, thank baub!","251335":"Willie's willing!","251336":"Me arm's been twisted, though!","251337":"This gets the Wibblesock seal of approval.","251338":"Oh how fabulous!","251339":"Not in a month of Sundays.","251340":"No! It's a nasty trick!","251341":"Nah! Get out of town!","251342":"Extremely generous terms.","251343":"I mean, if you're absolutely sure…!","251344":"You've even convinced the board!","251345":"Ideal for the Jorgensen Trust!","251346":"Only if it can be Wibblesock Ltd!' I told 'em, cheeky lad, they must have thought, but a talent!","251347":"A lot of it is pure Wibblyism, just ignore it. Unless you're a Wibblyist as well?","251348":"I know what hard work is. Never had to do it meself...but I've an idea of it, like.","251349":"Wibble Soc is a society of trickery and legerdemain. I am its principal, everywhere and nowhere at once!","251350":"The apparition! Always there in me mind's dreams. It whispers gravely, 'give me back that money you nit.'","251351":"I see it now. I am a vessel of 'occult forces', imbued with the untold power of gold.","251353":"No shame in a name like Wibblesock. It's actually pronounced 'Wibblaysoak' though, so remember that.","251356":"No need to sell yourself short!","251357":"Too generous for me to possibly accept!","251358":"I think that's too good to be true...","251359":"For some reason my advisors won't allow it!","251360":"Oh! The board have put in a veto.","251361":"Lovely Lady Hunt reminds me of my old mum, looking down, thinking, how did he do so well?","251362":"Oooh that Malching! I've had him an' his furry door-knocker in my dreams, telling me what I ain't.","251363":"Bente I adore thee, like a rose what smells lovely. One day I'll o'erstride, the darn class divide, and we'll uncork a bottle o' bubbly.","251364":"Don't make me say Alonso's name, please! He puts the willies up old Willie.","251365":"Vicente Silva's a bit of an 'awkins, eh? Never takes time to say hello.","251366":"I'm not sure old George can hear a word anyone says.

trust you.","256446":"Do I really have conviction in you?","256447":"Something about you still gives my people hope.","256448":"Dealing with you could be a lottery.","256449":"Little fish are careful

What of it...?","258497":"We usually meet by the light of the moon.","258498":"That just makes you fair game again, right boys?","258499":"Whatsay we come for your goods just the same?","258500":"Makes no odds to us how you want to be stung.","258501":"A fellow outcast eh? I'll be the judge of that.","258502":"Ye will never last with ol' Annie.","258503":"I knew you wouldn't stick it with us for long.","258504":"We prefer our own company anyway.","258508":"None of that pity, just the laying down of arms.","258509":"I don't expect you'll show mercy.","258510":"Trade us in, and we'll box you good and proper.","258511":"We pirates have special terms.","258512":"Willing to pay the price?","258513":"From now on, you'll stay away, d'yer hear?","258514":"Deal with my men again and I'll cut you a smile.","258515":"Haven't you heard? Pirates never barter!","258516":"Not 'cos we want to, 'cos we have to.","258517":"On one condition; you're still not a pirate.","258518":"Finally got you off our backs.","258519":"Good news, we don't need you any more.","258520":"Don't think you'll be getting any more.","258521":"This is an exception!","258522":"We'll have it back soon enough.","258523":"Don't waste yer effort, we're dead already.","258524":"Then a tiny independent nation rises proudly above the sea of injustice.","258525":"I'd gamble on me too, there's a bet I know I can't lose.","258526":"Then the die is cast. Our people have everything to fight for.","258527":"Better keep a poker face.","258528":"Bondye Bon.","258529":"The odds are in our favour.","258530":"Shows we're right to be persistent.","258531":"These moments are almost worth the struggle.","258532":"Something good to tell my little girl.","258533":"Bull's eye.","258534":"Don't waste that acumen of yours.","258535":"You might be bona fide after all.","258536":"You're good!","258537":"Look at you swagger!","258538":"I know you must be a libertarian deep down.","258539":"It's easy to get drawn in by you.","258540":"Are you finally embracing a just cause?","258541":"Things are hard enough as it is!","258542":"What am I going to tell my wife and daughter?","258543":"We don't need any more misfortune!","258544":"We just going to have to endure this.","258545":"Some hands you have to live with.","258546":"We're not ones to fold, no matter what!","258547":"Only a coward would give in now.","258548":"I don't think you're genuine.","258549":"You know, I scarcely need agitating.","258550":"So snake eyes, is that how it is?","258551":"Always did have you down as a despot.","258552":"What have you done?!","258553":"I'd hate to punish you, but if that's what it takes.","258554":"I've tried everything with you…","258555":"Thank the Almighty.","258556":"I'm grateful.","258557":"Lord knows we needed it.","258558":"As you wish.","258559":"Wi.","258560":"We're fine with it.","258561":"Non.","258562":"No dice.","258563":"When chicks teethe.","258570":"Let's both take a step back for a moment.","258571":"Some of us need time to regroup!","258572":"Oh, are we still fighting?","258573":"This should be a land of free and fair trade.","258574":"You can't afford to miss opportunities here.","258575":"We will be a respected trading nation like the rest.","258576":"Our terms of trade were a joke from the beginning.","258577":"There's no benefit to us in working with you.","258578":"We've got our own economy now.","258579":"No need for animosity, why don't we help each other?","258580":"I promise not to back out at the crucial moment.","258581":"I don't think you have my people's interests at heart.","258582":"You know, we do pretty well on our own.","258583":"A token of my people's good will.","258584":"Share and share alike, I say.","258585":"What can I say, I'm the giving type.","258587":"You're right, we need some perspective.","258588":"I also have my wife and children to think about.","258589":"Of course, we're always interested in commerce.","258590":"Well why wouldn't you trade with us?","258591":"What could possibly go wrong!","258592":"It's ok, we don't have to deal.","258593":"Strike out alone, I won't be a hypocrite.","258594":"Maybe its better we do our own thing.","258595":"I look forward to working with you.","258596":"An alliance built to last.","258597":"We all have our reasons, don't let me stop you.","258598":"No need to apologise, I understand.","259748":"To work with the lowest, yet answer only to God and the Queen. How many can say that?","259749":"Surely the choice is black and white, what with my clean record executing justice.","259750":"It's not my job to know their crimes, only to find a fitting punishment.","259751":"Everything seems in order.","259752":"I see no crime in this.","259753":"All running like clockwork.","259754":"Duty has its rewards.","259755":"A break from hard labour.","259756":"A light through the bars!","259757":"No less than is deserved.","259758":"Excellent.","259759":"Whatever your methods, you hide them well.","259760":"You run a tight ship.","259761":"I attest to your probity.","259762":"You execute well.","259763":"Your techniques are efficient.","259764":"Exemplary conduct.","259765":"This warrants an inquiry!","259766":"Someone will hang for this.","259767":"Criminal.","259768":"Never would have passed on my watch.","259769":"Everything, everyone, is suspect.","259770":"I will raise an injunction!","259771":"It's misery by proxy.","259772":"Your negligence is criminal.","259773":"Careful you don't end up on my island.","259774":"So you were the perpetrator!","259775":"If you aren't with me, villain…","259776":"You tread a very thin line.","259777":"Fall foul of me, and fall foul of sovereign law.","259778":"Don't expect to get off scot-free.","259779":"Justice served.","259780":"Community service is it?","259781":"That's the least I'm due for my suffering.","259782":"If we must.","259783":"I permit it.","259784":"Seems legitimate.","259787":"Not interested.","259788":"Nix to it!","259789":"I'm going to have to shut it off.","259791":"If you're after something unique, you can expect to pay for it.","259792":"The Emporium Exotique doesn't open its doors to just anyone you know.","259793":"You're looking for something, and I can help you find it.","259794":"Isn't that a curiosity.","259795":"Intriguing.","259796":"What an exciting turn.","259797":"This is turning into quite a story.","259798":"Exhilarating.","259799":"So, the secret's out.","259800":"A good outcome.","259801":"Maybe I was wrong about you.","259802":"You've got my attention.","259803":"What a killer instinct.","259804":"There's merchant in you.","259805":"You can be quite cutthroat.","259806":"You've rocked the apple cart.","259807":"I like the way you set out your stall.","259808":"What a surprise.","259809":"Just as expected.","259810":"And life once seemed so thrilling.","259811":"Typical.","259812":"What a tangle.","259813":"I anticipated that.","259814":"Disappointing.","259815":"You'll have to do better than that.","259816":"That's your best offer?","259817":"Are you wasting my time?","259818":"You need to be more ruthless.","259819":"Not much in the way of business sense.","259820":"I've seen some stupid things…","259821":"Oh you're not another one of those…","259822":"Maybe I shouldn't insist on working alone.","259823":"I'm grateful but I won't lower my prices.","259824":"This favour will repay itself in other ways.","259825":"Interesting, very well.","259826":"Sounds tempting enough.","259827":"Agreed.","259828":"I'm not interested.","259829":"My days of risk-taking are over.","259830":"I might have agreed to that once, not any more.","259831":"Of course we will take a stand beside you, if you are for freedom and justice!","259832":"Now is the time for choosing sides. Just or unjust.","259833":"We join on one condition, that like you we are free to write our own history.","259834":"We can build on this.","259835":"It is good news.","259836":"Let's take nothing for granted.","259837":"This is progress at least.","259838":"We are all the stronger for this.","259839":"A small win, but we'll take it.","259840":"A flicker of hope.","259841":"Champion of the underdog!","259842":"I wanted to believe you'd come through.","259843":"It takes courage to make a stand.","259844":"I was right to trust you.","259845":"Your heart is in the right place.","259846":"You have achieved a lot.","259847":"May there be more good news from you.","259848":"It is only a setback.","259849":"We will come back stronger.","259850":"Nothing we aren't ready for.","259851":"We can't give up.","259852":"This cannot be allowed to harm our plans.","259853":"We can find a way around this.","259854":"We've seen worse.","259855":"You should have more faith.","259856":"Are you crazy?","259857":"I thought we had trust.","259858":"You will expose us.","259859":"I don't want to cut ties with you.","259860":"Ask youself, whose side are you on?","259861":"Don't burn all your bridges.","259862":"We won't forget this.","259863":"I am so happy someone could help us.","259864":"Words can't express how grateful we are.","259865":"We could use a distraction.","259866":"We can make it work.","259867":"It is a risk worth taking.","259868":"There must be a better way.","259869":"There is no time for this.","259870":"This will not help our struggle.","259872":"It makes one feel frisky and alive!","259873":"We ARE amused!","259874":"This suits us very well.","259875":"How wonderful to have it our own way!","259876":"How mischievous one feels!","259877":"It has all gone off very satisfactorily!","259878":"All is much as it should be.","259879":"Be strong in business, and become a pillar of our nation.","259880":"You continue to be of the greatest use to us.","259881":"Your successes must be a source of pride.","259882":"We appreciate your efforts.","259883":"Parliament commends you exceedingly.","259884":"You slide easily about the board like the rook!","259885":"You are a very able servant of the realm.","259886":"We are not amused!","259887":"The Queen regrets this distressing affair.","259888":"Another Queen may have turned to execution by now.","259889":"It is gravely injurious to our nation.","259890":"One wants prompt action against such outrage.","259891":"It is a time of discord for those of my station.","259892":"One of the many threats to my position.","259893":"The Queen finds your conduct inexcusable!","259894":"My father would have had you executed!","259895":"You WILL do better!","259896":"What a perilously selfish subject you are!","259897":"Your Queen is displeased with you.","259898":"Parliament will discuss what shall be done with you.","259899":"Tantamount to treason!","259900":"Then we owe our gratitude.","259901":"It is much admired.","259902":"Sincere thanks for attending to this matter.","259903":"It would be prudent to accept.","259904":"Oh, we are only too happy to agree.","259905":"We shall be delighted.","259906":"Shame Queens can't chop heads anymore.","259907":"Heaven forbid!","259908":"If that is a joke, it is not a funny one.","259909":"Yer a canny herring!","259910":"Yer know the ropes!","259911":"The crew come 'round to you.","259912":"Kelpie-blood in yer veins!","259913":"I know a sea-soul when I see one!","259914":"All at sea!","259915":"Years at sea, never sank this low.","259916":"May as well be sunk!","259917":"A most uneven keel!","259918":"The worst things happen at sea!","259919":"Yer aff yer head!","259920":"Drag us down with yer, eh?!","259921":"You'd have us piss in the wind!","259922":"You seem a loose cannon.","259923":"I won't say 'mutiny', Admiral.","259924":"I'll steer ye from here to the precipice, the edge of the world!","259925":"I'll cap'n for ye, til blood boil or freeze in my veins.","259928":"Pumping pistons!","259929":"No flies on me.","259930":"I'm over the moon.","259931":"I'm lighter than air.","259932":"I'd be blown away, if not for me ropes…","259933":"Whizbang!","259934":"Soaring like a buzzard.","259935":"You're flying!","259936":"Self-propelled, I see.","259937":"You make silk purses from sow's ears.","259938":"Sift and you will find.","259939":"You've got a spark.","259940":"Something always drops from the pipe with you.","259941":"Rubbish!","259942":"Fly-blown frass!","259943":"It unhinges me!","259944":"Soiled my day.","259945":"Bahhh!","259946":"Hollow piles o' dung.","259947":"I haven't time for this!","259948":"You're dynamite!","259949":"You're cranking my crank.","259950":"Don't ratchet me temper!","259951":"I'll 'ave yer bones!","259952":"I've a bone to pick with you.","259953":"Yer damp and dirty drape.","259954":"Yer smudge-pot.","259955":"Oily little toerag.","259956":"How touching.","259957":"I'm a grateful sackful.","259958":"Tinker very much.","259959":"I'm in.","259960":"Could be worse I s'pose.","259961":"Then what we waitin' for, let's get stuck in.","259962":"I won't be manipulated.","259963":"What's in it for me?","259964":"Gorr, take me for an idiot?","259965":"Where are my charts?","259966":"Preparation!","259967":"It's sextant time.","259968":"Let's extend the old telescope.","259969":"Time to rummage in the old sea chest.","259970":"Thank the Admiral.","259971":"Takes a lot to sway an old dog.","259972":"Me heart swells like the surf.","259973":"Aye, aye!","259974":"If the Admiral commands it!","259975":"Full steam ahead.","259976":"So be it!","259977":"Make it so!","259978":"As sure as the tide.","259979":"We do as commanded.","259980":"That we shall!","259981":"Nay, I cannae!","259982":"Enough, no more!","259983":"Damned if I will!","259984":"And all because of me.","259985":"And I was always so overlooked!","259986":"Not everyone is born for success.","259987":"They must now see it was I who turned out best.","259988":"I was always the dutiful child, the good child.","259989":"Finally, after all I've suffered.","259990":"Proof I should have been the one chosen.","259991":"You'll never be special, you know.","259992":"Heavens, you think this makes you a Goode?","259993":"Helpful or not, your presence is unwelcome.","259994":"Nothing you do will lift the cloud.","259995":"It's the least you could do.","259996":"Your father would be proud.","259997":"Perhaps now you'll leave me in peace e'gad.","259998":"Things never go without a hiccup, do they?!","259999":"This is folly!","260000":"Every time I have to play second fiddle!","260001":"What is the meaning of this!?","260002":"Why do I deserve to suffer!","260003":"It was agreed this matter would be settled!","260004":"I am more than capable of dealing with this!","260005":"Isn't it obvious? Everything is your fault.","260006":"Our family should have disowned you long ago.","260007":"Why couldn't you stay away?","260008":"This is all your doing.","260009":"Wastrel.","260010":"You always were a disappointment.","260011":"You have no inkling of this business!","260012":"Don't expect gratitude.","260013":"Oh thank heaven.","260014":"Sweet mercy.","260015":"See, I'm not afraid to take a calculated risk.","260016":"Why would there be a problem?","260017":"Why should I have compunctions about it?","260018":"I have decided otherwise!","260019":"Don't tell me what to do!","260020":"There will be no negotiation!","260021":"You do have a ship, Admiral?","260022":"Perhaps some form of sea craft?","260023":"We'll need the finest ship!","260024":"Where is she, let me see her!","260025":"What have yer christened her?","260026":"Something to keep us going, Admiral?","260027":"No provisions?!","260028":"On biscuit alone?","260029":"What of supplies?","260030":"I'd take anything I could just now.","260031":"Isn't she running a little light?!","260032":"We'll be taking a chance, Admiral.","260033":"I don't know if she's up to this!","260034":"Better hope she has spirit.","260035":"We'll have to take your word.","260036":"I suppose she'll do.","260037":"Not the worst manifest.","260038":"We're adequately stocked.","260039":"She's set fair enough.","260040":"I can't make any promises.","260041":"Ready as she'll ever be!","260042":"She's an honour to command, Admiral.","260043":"Rigged to succeed.","260044":"She's beautifully fitted.","260045":"Stacked in our favour.","260046":"Nothing to fear.","260048":"I am somewhat heartened.","260052":"High spirits.","260053":"Ready for anything.","260054":"Wind's in our sails","260055":"It'll be a breeze!","260056":"Plain sailing!","260057":"Seen better odds, and worse.","260058":"How many lives have we left?","260059":"I am more hopeful than I was.","260060":"All seems well for now.","260061":"Signs are more encouraging.","260062":"Times must be good.","260063":"I shouldn't complain at times like these.","260064":"All quite bearable.","260065":"I wouldn't like to wager.","260066":"Stick or twist?","260067":"It's your call, Admiral.","260068":"Only fate truly knows.","260069":"Only the wind can say.","260070":"Put more skulls on the pile?","260071":"A sword hangs above us.","260072":"Turn about, before it's too late.","260073":"All I can do is to warn you.","260074":"If doom it must be, we will follow.","260075":"I'm happy for you, really I am.","260076":"You might feel rather pleased with yourself.","260077":"You've kept things in good order.","260078":"No-one can begrudge your achievements.","260079":"You have not been unsuccessful!","260080":"Your dedication is commendable.","260081":"You work with reassuring method.","260082":"This grim monotony is worse than life.","260083":"I should like to be someone else.","260084":"Sigh...","260085":"I find this all so trivial.","260086":"How dull.","260087":"I want to feel something, just not irritable!","260088":"I'm tired of being tired.","260089":"You give me no comfort at present.","260090":"I worried you might be this sort of person.","260091":"You forget yourself.","260092":"A quaint interpretation of precision.","260093":"When you overlook minutiaie, things go awry.","260094":"And it's all the harder when one is alone!","260095":"It's a disordered tangle of briar.","260096":"What luxury!","260097":"Most cordial!","260098":"We feel most welcome","260099":"What a breath of fresh air.","260100":"How agreeable.","260101":"You inspire something in me.","260102":"Courteous from the moment we arrived.","260103":"Aren't you most accommodating.","260104":"You make for a charming host.","260105":"People must look up to you greatly.","260106":"This is not what was promised.","260107":"This is not as advertised!","260108":"The brochure was misleading!","260109":"We paid an awful lot to come here.","260110":"I may just catch the next boat home.","260111":"What a way for you to treat a guest.","260112":"You are a monstrous host.","260113":"Are you the manager?!","260114":"Are you responsible for this predicament?","260115":"You make things extraordinarily inconvenient!","260116":"I've finally arrived! Now to see if the journey was worth it.","260117":"Finally terra firma! I cannot wait to look around and explore.","260118":"Lovely day for seafront perambulation!","260119":"I'm writing a postcard - Ahem - just need someone to deliver it?","260120":"My portmanteau has spilled out everywhere!","260121":"Oh! Do you have a luncheon recommendation?","260122":"Good thing you caught me, we are about to take tea!","260128":"And at no additional cost?","260129":"What an unexpected treat!","260130":"Oh, much obliged!","260131":"When in Rome!","260132":"Happy to take that route.","260133":"Just the ticket!","260139":"Putting the first foot out of the door was the best decision I've ever made.","260140":"With so much out there to see, one has little time for homesickness, though I do keep pictures in my locket.","260141":"Certain gentlemen might recoil seeing ladies travel alone, but that is well, if recoiled they remain.","260142":"I notice that from altitude, it appears rather like an immense toy city!","260143":"Were the world a book, most wouldn't pass the foreword. Shame, because chapter one is just about the juiciest.","260144":"How about a parambrella, for rain or shine? Goodness knows how I could use such a thing.","260148":"We have a very fixed itinerary.","260149":"That's not in the handbook!","260150":"I won't be led from the beaten path!","260151":"Purge the filth of ego inside yourself!","260152":"You are that carefree?","260153":"Want to be a hero? Try being a human first.","260154":"Get a grip on your destiny.","260155":"I know you. This isn't you.","260156":"If you seek heaven, you have far to go.","260157":"If you go down, I'll go down with you.","260158":"I'd rather be stuck at sea.","260159":"Monsoons of bad feeling!","260160":"Dreadful.","260161":"God hates us.","260162":"Miserable.","260163":"No-one deserves this.","260164":"Why are we even here?","260165":"For once you have my respect, old pal.","260166":"You've come a long way.","260167":"You bust the world open like ripe fruit.","260168":"Good fire-breather! Thaw this frozen wasteland.","260169":"Conquer your mind, conquer the world.","260170":"You do your family honour.","260171":"Milk the willing cow!","260172":"Sweet nectar.","260173":"Cascades of good feeling.","260174":"We are blessed.","260175":"No sun, but somehow all rosy.","260176":"Better than being at sea.","260177":"God loves us.","260178":"Perfection is close.","260179":"Ah old pal, it's been a while since we adventured together.","260180":"I've been waiting for your call, old pal, wherever you go I will follow.","260181":"I'm behind you, even if no-one else is.","260182":"I feel you need my capital.","260183":"I invest in upstanding people.","260184":"Any takeover would be done ethically.","260185":"Takeovers should be founded on strong principles…","260186":"Don't you cut in, you slippery fish.","260187":"This island's not about money, it's about people.","260188":"If you want to buy into my island, you buy into my ideas.","260189":"People who just take and take til there's nothing left...","260190":"Those people will never go willingly. (moral threat)","260191":"I'm grateful my claim has been settled amicably.","260192":"You've given these people prospects, I ought to thank you.","260193":"I see you trampled every forward step I made there.","260194":"You can crush everything on that island but its soul.","260195":"I admire your transparency of conduct over the island.","260196":"The acquisition was an honourable one.","260197":"Only a heathen would try to overwrite history.","260198":"The trick is to invest in the right people.","260199":"Let old Beryl take a slice.","260200":"I like to have a finger in every pie.","260201":"Well I haven't snatched it just yet!","260202":"Islands, fame, a bit of money can buy anything.","260203":"Are you sure you want to be part of me mob?","260204":"I know what you're after, and I can't let you have it.","260205":"Ah, so you want to play that game?","260206":"My island. Don't get any funny ideas.","260207":"Take it! I'll still be there in one way or toher!","260208":"Beryl wouldn't want to take it behind yer back, now.","260209":"Nice to make a legitimate acquisition.","260210":"You can pull the strings there now.","260211":"As far as you know it's all yours.","260212":"Who cares about the past, I like to live in the present.","260213":"Everything changes, it's yer one guarantee in life.","260214":"I'd have made a clean break too.","260215":"And my critics say I don't take enough risks.","260216":"I can appreciate the art of others.","260217":"My therapist says money matters dominate middle age.","260218":"I'll make sure it has a smooth finish.","260219":"Maybe losing your island will polish you off?","260220":"Don't lurk as if I am somehow past it!","260221":"What? Not even I can afford one of my pieces!","260222":"I firmly believe art should be shared by all.","260223":"You will never fully appreciate it!","260224":"You will turn majesty into a monstrosity.","260225":"Even a featureless desert can be Eden in the right hands.","260226":"This island is clay, and I am its sculptor.","260227":"An island with too many rough edges.","260228":"A chinless island. I won't work with such materials!","260229":"You cannot rewrite the history of art!","260230":"This is the desecration of all human culture!","260231":"Such vandalism weighs heavier than a thousand lives!","260232":"Perhaps a change of fortunes.","260233":"Well, I shan't be an ingrate.","260234":"A thank you is probably in order.","260235":"Oh what does it matter either way...","260236":"What else can I do but accept...","260237":"Then it shall be so...","260238":"No indeed!","260239":"I can't let it happen.","260240":"Really this is too much.","260241":"Thank the high one.","260242":"This is a blessing.","260243":"Divine succour!","260244":"Of course.","260245":"Odd, but good.","260246":"Curious. I accept.","260247":"Hush your mouth!","260248":"Why should I!?","260249":"I will not!","260250":"A good leader uses every weapon at their disposal.","260252":"As you see I've never struggled for money.","260253":"As you see, the family wealth is considerable.","260254":"How peculiar to insist we wait at port. Is something the matter?","260255":"This island needs proper leadership…","260256":"Be honest, the responsibility is too much for you.","260257":"Only empires can assimilate!","260258":"I never agreed you could be a shareholder!","260259":"Every man and his dog has money these days.","260260":"This island is crucial, you'll ruin everything!","260261":"You can't just go waltzing in!","260262":"I'm glad you gave it up without a fight.","260263":"Thanks for giving me a view of the battlefield.","260264":"An insignificant little acreage.","260265":"I only care for strategic outposts.","260266":"Pillage marks the depraved, and the doomed.","260267":"Those who go too far always regret it.","260268":"The complete debellation of my legacy.","260269":"This city is a magnet for genius.","260270":"We're in the presence of a virtuoso!","260271":"How thrilling! A renowned personage has arrived!","260272":"I shall be a trustee.","260273":"I hope I can gradually seed change.","260274":"All my life savings.","260275":"Of course, nobody wants you to lose your island...","260276":"There comes a time when we must make way for something better.","260277":"To share in reward, you must share in pain.","260278":"Meddlesome little...","260279":"Silver will not save you.","260280":"I will not rest until it is returned to me.","260281":"It will be difficult to forgive you this act of treachery!","260282":"It's good to see you are compliant.","260283":"A modest retreat to partake in my hobbies.","260284":"The secret may be out about this place.","260285":"Enjoy life there while you may.","260286":"You seize the day, and I'll wait for night.","260287":"The forest shall soon grow again,  darker and denser.","260288":"I remember what was there, don't you fret.","260289":"Even if the place is changed, the memory remains most powerful.","260290":"A surge of interest here this season.","260291":"Always hard to keep places under one's hat.","260292":"An ever-more popular site for we pilgrims.","260293":"Coming into fashion as a destination.","260294":"Where interest wanes, there will be a reason.","260295":"Numbers seem to have dropped off.","260296":"Perhaps they're going to prettier places.","260297":"That there are fewer of us should tell you something.","260298":"Visitors are falling away.","260299":"No more or less popular than before.","260300":"Our cruise was just as full as last time.","260301":"I'm glad, at least, it is not any busier.","260302":"I see the same faces whenever I come here.","260303":"Same old holiday gang as last time.","260317":"A sensation!","260318":"Everything seems up-to-the-minute!","260319":"Oh to exit these rat tubes!","260320":"I would lick spittle for you, governor.","260321":"You teach us endlessly.","260322":"In the headlines for all the right reasons.","260323":"You are more than a silent observer.","260324":"A scandal!","260325":"Black, white, and red all over!","260326":"No, drag me through the mud.","260327":"Nothing will make me leave your side.","260328":"You do keep us on our toes...","260329":"Ignore my miserable-type face.","260330":"Left to rot with last year's pumpkins!","260331":"The place is a bloomin' hole!","260332":"We've been hung out to dry!","260333":"What a dung heap.","260334":"Rather drown in slurry, than live 'ere.","260335":"This is the last straw!","260336":"I won't 'ave my babbies in squalor!","260337":"It's a filthy pigsty!","260338":"We're livin' hand-to-mouth.","260339":"It's harrowin' livin' 'ere.","260340":"We've been lured to a vile shanty-town!","260341":"I'd rather stand behind an elephant than ever return!","260342":"I will see these slums in my nightmares.","260343":"This city is a house of horrors!","260344":"A bit municipal isn't it?","260345":"It lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.","260346":"It's everything they said it would be.","260347":"I shall remember these fine edifices for some time.","260348":"I'm in love with this living watercolour!","260349":"It's peculiar here.","260350":"What do I see here? Little piles of dog lime.","260351":"This might be a once-in-a-lifetime trip.","260352":"As a centre, it is the palest shade of mediocre.","260353":"Pleasant, despite the odd pickpocket.","260354":"I think we've seen everything there is to see.","260355":"Good, but nothing to write home about.","260356":"It's nice, though the sand is too yellow.","260357":"There's a satisfying amount to enjoy.","260358":"My impression is in the main, positive.","260359":"The streets and buildings are arranged nicely.","260360":"I have no regrets about coming here.","260361":"One wonders at the genius who built all this.","260362":"What romance dwells in these streets!","260363":"It is no façade, the charms of this city are real!","260364":"So many magnificent vistas, I've lost count.","260365":"A paradise! The pleasantest conceivable bubble!","260366":"Coming here has changed my life forever.","260367":"A city of angels, streets paved with gold!","260368":"Please tell me this visit shall never be over!","260369":"Can I interest you in this recently-polished apple?","260370":"The idiot is back. Oh heavens I...I thought you were the photographer.","260371":"We feel safe!","260372":"Barely noticed there's a war on.","260373":"There's a war, apparently.","260374":"Sounds like you need a few scarecrows.","260375":"Keep them foreign rabbits off our lettuce!","260376":"The enemy's clutching at straws.","260383":"I found a sheep skull, is it a sign?","260384":"Our way o' life's under threat.","260385":"Cracks are appearing everywhere.","260395":"The first? Ooh, am I to receive a prize?","260396":"I could be the first to bring a new gem to light!","260397":"Do I have the whole place to myself!?","260398":"I beg you, no.","260399":"Surely you don't expect us to wade ashore?","260400":"Where is the welcome party?","260401":"I'm really much better at self-editing on paper...","260402":"We'll come flooding in now, I'm sure.","260403":"A gateway to imagination!","260422":"We're out of things to do but wait for the ferry.","260423":"We're bored now, so we're leaving.","260426":"You can't treat us like this!","260427":"My heart's filled with hatred!","260428":"I could smash the walls!","260429":"Hear the plea of the multitude!","260430":"A matter o' time before we explode!","260431":"Ruddy feudal system!","260432":"Petitions and signat'ries is all we need.","260433":"We're one angry voice!","260434":"I'm thinkin' of joining the chartists!","260435":"If you don't listen, things are gonna get dangerous!","260466":"If war is what it takes!","260467":"You'd hardly call it a war yet.","260468":"We're all behind you.","260469":"A civilian can voice his support.","260470":"From conflict come bold futures.","260471":"We're a united front.","260477":"An overwhelmingly positive edition!","260478":"We'll be alright.","260479":"If there's danger, tell us.","260480":"Should we be worried now?","260488":"A glowing review, absolutely no need to change it!","260489":"Ah! Good news!","260490":"We could hardly dig anything up! A-haha.","260491":"Your conscience must be spotless!","260492":"You'll want to leave this one as it is, won't you?","260493":"Too harsh?","260494":"Does it go too far?","260495":"It's as kind as we could make it.","260496":"I tried sweetening it.","260497":"We all have to swallow bitter pills sometimes.","260498":"We have done our best.","260499":"Once bright blossom now rotting stench!","260500":"I care not even for my craft.","260501":"We are a dying dream!","260502":"Bound in poison ivy!","260503":"Despair, may it all end soon.","260504":"My soul to the devil, or anyone!","260505":"If god exists, he is too cruel!","260506":"Piteous hole, a sickness of the soul.","260507":"All of my life, for nothing!","260508":"Like Persephone, I count my days in hell.","260519":"Are you sur— Of course you're sure.","260520":"Mum's the word.","260521":"I'm certain they won't read between the lines.","260522":"Call it a white lie.","260523":"The subtext is totally imperceptible.","260524":"Poetic licence.","260525":"It took minimal revision.","260526":"Something like this?","260527":"It is but a passing tempest!","260528":"Beyond the field of battle, beds of sweet lavender.","260529":"If we must have war, we shall win!","260530":"After all, papers are for drumming-up support.","260531":"You certainly have us by the leash!","260532":"It is possible to survive on scraps.","260533":"Diverting.","260534":"What glad news.","260535":"Sound the trumpets!","260536":"You are always uniquely diplomatic.","260537":"We will all be absolutely behind you.","260538":"Nobody would dare challenge your authority!","260539":"Frightening stuff!","260540":"You won't hear a peep from me.","260544":"It can only do them good, I'm sure.","260545":"Austerity, very wise.","260546":"I don't think it too severe, not at all.","260547":"Sometimes nice to have tangential news.","260548":"I don't think it's misleading.","260549":"There may be the odd unchecked fact.","260550":"Should keep them flicking through pages.","260551":"That should draw attention away from...hm.","260552":"Please, don't let them hurt me!","260553":"I am terribly, terribly afraid.","260554":"We will soon be grieving over the dead!","260555":"Candlepower ain't enough for this job.","260556":"We need 'lectricity to even start!","260557":"This place needs jolting into life!","260558":"It's important to be happy.","260559":"I think they'll swallow it.","260560":"It's a different perspective.","260564":"There's no electric!","260565":"Oi! Who turned off the lights?","260566":"We've run out of juice!","260567":"We shall not weary, but fight the eagle's grasp!","260568":"Will another glorious field be won this day?","260569":"I can already feel the swell of triumph!","260572":"Do you not see I'm incandescent?!","260573":"These conditions are an insult!","260574":"Not even the balustrades are burnished!","260575":"Just plain rude!","260576":"You will improve my situation at once!","260577":"It's tattier here than a pauper's trouser!","260578":"Of course I'm going to say what I think!","260579":"This city is an abomination!","260580":"The service is ruddy despicable!","260581":"I demand every appurtenance of my station!","260582":"The enemy has no chance of crashing our economy!","260583":"The enemy won't rock our boat, eh!","260584":"We're as safe as my nest egg.","260585":"I'm confident this island is impregnable!","260586":"Trust me, this rock is absolutely secure!","260587":"A war might even boost the markets.","260594":"For god's sake keep us safe can't you!?","260595":"The invaders will know who I am!","260596":"I will not be a prisoner in my own home!","260603":"We're quite out of energy!","260604":"We feel powerless!","260605":"There is simply no spark!","260612":"On the brink of eruption!","260613":"Who neglects their affairs in this way!","260614":"Absolute zero!","260615":"My reaction is not remotely extreme!","260616":"I am positively indignant!","260617":"Categorically unacceptable!","260618":"A failed experiment!","260619":"A place where ignorance abounds!","260620":"I am one negative particle!","260621":"Life must improve by a factor of 1000!","260622":"Perhaps war will spur scientific growth.","260623":"Conflict can sometimes be a catalyst.","260624":"War is always a litmus test.","260625":"Our chances look good on paper.","260626":"Unless the situation changes, I'll keep to my work.","260627":"Calculations show we are quite safe for the moment.","260633":"I'm sorry I'm no military engineer.","260634":"If I could only fashion a grenado…","260635":"I wish I'd studied military science.","260822":"Electricity is essential!","260823":"Did you forget to flick the switch?","260824":"Direct current now!","260838":"I am certain Alonso can be a majestic butterfly, once he emerges from his alarmingly spiny cocoon!","260839":"Mr Malching sent me a forward proposal. I myself then forwarded it to the fireplace.","260840":"I'm sure Mr Gasparov's people are as much in love with his designs as he is.","260841":"I often take tea with Beryl to see how her funny little urchins are getting along.","260842":"We all know Willie 's silly, but I won't  be the one to say he can't get his act together.","260843":"I admire how tranquil Lady Margaret is, and after all that has happened to her family.","260844":"Admiral Vicente does have a very cold sort of laugh.","260845":"It is emboldening to be among Jean La Fortune's young and aspiring people!","260846":"I still believe the Jorgensen Trust would be of interest to Her Majesty the Queen.","260847":"If ever you lack inspiration, seek Sir Archie, he is ever so happy to help!","260848":"Poor Anne Harlow. It does distress me to see how her star has fallen.","260849":"Old Nate has a lovely time up in that balloon. Perhaps he could make one for me!","260850":"I wish I were Isabel. Clever and cunning, and fighting for freedom!","260851":"I simply love Madame Kahina's shop, I hope it doesn't bother her I never buy anything.","260852":"I'm sure like so many others, Edvard could have been a good person.","260853":"Mr. Bleakworth does isolate himself, he should really try and take some fresh air.","260854":"I always adored the rambling talk of travelling ambassadors - be careful what you wish for.","260855":"My mother the Empress would have me carry out her orders instead. But I cannot, I cannot...","260862":"I'd be more modest about my eight treaties on equality, if they weren't still so goddamn necessary!","260863":"At school, they said I'd make a fine preacher. That's one thing I made sure I never did do.","260864":"The perfect society IS possible, if all spring in the same direction, like an arrow from the bowstring.","260865":"I found medicine very tedious, you need a lot of patients.","260866":"Time and struggle right wrong, but I've not much of either left to give.","260867":"Eli Bleakworth's small mind follows duty blind.","260868":"Artur and I became good friends, in spite of our contradictions.","260869":"Looking for my little regulars? Ah you won't spot 'em so easy.","260870":"Give 'em work and education, and they'll forgive yer the rest.","260871":"I pride meself on what I've built, for the urchins.","260872":"People should love yer, and if they don't, should fear yer.","260873":"What's down in the hold is my concern not yours, dear.","260874":"She may look sweet, but she'll hit below the belt if she has to.","260875":"If you want to get ahead, keep on the move.","260876":"They know not to be followed, they do.","260877":"We all have our little superstitions. I like to keep a knife in me satin boots.","260878":"Careful who you call friends. I'd rather have a bar of gold than a hundred of silver.","260879":"Keep your cards close to your chest, dearie. Check every dice thrice.","260880":"They call me a saint! Bless their little hearts, they don't know I'm a sinner!","260881":"I'll let you in on a secret, I'll always try to be nice. Life's too short.","260882":"I think we all know Willie's a numbskull. That's why we love him.","260883":"Bente is lovely; she knows absolutely nothing about the world, and the way things are.","260884":"Princess Qing enjoys forgeries like they're masterworks, and y'know, I agree with her.","260885":"God knows I'm not perfect, but Alonso might consider going to confession once in a while.","260886":"I reckon George Smith could've made a lot of money if he weren't such a stickler.","260887":"Last time Gasparov gave me a lecture, I pocketed a drawer of his silverware.","260888":"Carl is a disgusting, downright shameful creature, and I can't stop thinking about him.","260889":"You'd have to be pretty gullible to believe Lady Margaret's what she seems.","260890":"I've played chess with Silva; when he saw he was losing, he tried to upset the board.","260892":"Turning her back on the beau monde, Miss Harlow brings shame upon her family name.","260893":"Damn those pirates. Damn their greed!","260894":"Isabel Sarmento shakes the foundations of society! They should feed her to the lions!","260895":"I don't know where Kahina gets her prices!","260896":"I don't know that a bust chiselled in my image could ever really capture my true spirit!","260897":"I've been seeing Dr. Fraud for some time now. I'd recommend probing psychoanalysis to anyone.","260898":"Sacrifices must be made for us to have harmony here.","260899":"Call me old-fashioned, but I like to keep order.","260900":"Everything in its right place, and to everything its due.","260901":"I am a fossil, I won't pretend to understand modern ways.","260902":"My fleet are as unswerving as I, in their obligations.","260903":"I have ships in many harbours.","260904":"Humble trade ships, nothing more.","260905":"The face that launched a thousand ships.","260906":"I'd rather count heads than have four-poster beds.","260907":"I don't need to dress like Pope Joan to rule these reprobates.","260908":"Yeah life here's miserable, spare me the requiem.","260909":"Father'd've hated to see me live like this, but I don't care.","260910":"Yeah, I stole this ship. Start as you mean to go on!","260911":"No coward man is Annie's match at sea.","260912":"The ship it was their coffin, and their grave it was the sea","260913":"We pirates may not rule the waves, but we make them bloody choppy.","260914":"Sherwood forest, where the merry men hide out.","260915":"Our code may be strict, but it keeps our feet on the ground.","260916":"We're our own masters now, and we're building something here.","260917":"Little by little, the bird builds its nest.","260918":"Now we've a taste of freedom, we're not going to let go.","260919":"If only people listened, we'd lay down our guns.","260920":"We've had to fight to keep ourselves afloat.","260921":"I hope there comes a time we can stop fighting.","260922":"All the punishments you see are more than justified!","260923":"Too late to recover these sinners from Satan.","260924":"No way out, and no way in. Well, except through the door.","260925":"Look at them. Sickening specimens.","260926":"Don't try and rock the boat.","260927":"Meticulously drilled, and loyal to the crown.","260928":"Transportation worse than prison? Don't be so sure!","260929":"The antithesis of Noah's Ark.","260930":"I hope you aren't looking for life here.","260931":"I used to dangle from the eaves of buildings like these.","260932":"My customers appreciate the tranquillity.","260933":"After everything, I can forgive some peace and quiet.","260934":"It's wise to be ready to move on, to take change in your stride.","260935":"My routes crisscross the globe, to ensure I have the best to offer.","260936":"You don't always need to run a tight ship.","260937":"Ships don't really interest me.","260938":"This is where liberation starts.","260939":"We make do with what we have.","260940":"I hope they'll remember this as the birthplace of a revolution.","260941":"This is our new home now, we should be happy for that.","260942":"We've got to be agile, ready to move at the drop of a hat.","260943":"We can load up in a day, and be gone in a night.","260944":"It's hard to get ships. We are lucky to have friends to help us.","260945":"We never sink a ship if we can take it.","260946":"A discretionary fleet for national emergencies.","260947":"I want to be a spearhead not a figurehead.","260948":"We do not solicit violence, yet under my rule it seems as constant as the crashing waves.","260949":"I do not forget the sacrifice of these sailors on my account.","260950":"Should hold together for a time.","260951":"Soldiers had no use for the iron, all frozen such as they were.","260952":"I scratched and scraped for this.","260953":"I always dreamed of a little shack to call my own.","260954":"She used to be a wreck, but you'd never guess.","260955":"I put a lot o' graft into fixing her up.","260956":"The bow's made o' hodgepodge.","260957":"Made of sterner stuff— like boiled hooves.","260958":"Keep out! None of your business!","260959":"If your father had only let me in, we could have built this together...","260960":"This city will be a credit to our family, you'll see.","260961":"Commerce and industry can haul Goode and Sons back from the grave.","260962":"I modernised the trade fleet the moment I took control.","260963":"The sea is in my blood, just as much as it was in your father's.","260964":"I have routes all planned out, they're perfect! Perfect!","260965":"Of course I have enough experience handling sailors!","260970":"Too soon to head home?","260971":"Have we enough biscuit to last us?","260972":"We better let you decide, admiral.","260973":"What are our chances?","260974":"Do you think we can make it?","260983":"I've recently discovered hypnosis— works wonders on the sleepless.","260984":"Natural history helps us understand why the crocodile mother defends its brood, or the scorpion keeps a sting in its tail.","260985":"I prefer coffee of late. One learns to embrace the bitterness.","260986":"I retired from the spotlight when I remarried. But being part of the royal council is a pleasing distraction.","260987":"Though I've been a Hunt  for a long time, it's as my dead brother used to say; once a Harlow, always a Harlow.","260988":"I would not leave this life, until I felt I'd achieved a sense of peace.","260989":"If people want something to get behind, we have to encourage them!","260990":"Wibblesock is a small boy, with the temerity to believe life is some schoolyard game.","260992":"I have had the misfortune to take tea with Beryl, her piggled cakes and sugary tea.","260993":"Artur's own reflection will swallow him up soon enough.","260994":"Her Majesty honours me with a position on the council, but I prefer to stay out of the light.","260995":"Testing times for the monarchy, but I'm sure balance will be restored soon.","260996":"Silva is from a rival empire. You should think about eliminating him.","260997":"Poor Anne. She is my niece you know—our ways are so different I often forget.","260998":"The unpredictable, like Graves, develop no power to predict.","260999":"George Smith wants a better world? Well.. don't we all!","261000":"Von Malching keeps things to himself, I like that.","261001":"Proud to be exactly what my father wasn't - a traitor! God save the Queen!","261002":"A thousand privateers who would die to live, and me, who lives only to die.","261003":"We are wronged, all of us. The Empire shall feel the wrath of scimitar, spear and cutlass!","261004":"My whole house gone to hell, but for I, the last swish of its flaming tail.","261005":"If execution was good enough for my brother, it'll be good enough for Her Majesty.","261006":"Any pirate not flying my flag is a dead man - you hear me La Fortune?!","261007":"Even I don't completely hate Bente.","261008":"Aunt Maggie doesn't approve of barefaced vengeance.","261009":"I'll jam the crown down over her ears, for my father 'Ben Harlow!'","261010":"I'll rip off Blake's toupee, and make him eat it like a dog.","261011":"Graves has it right, only death can wash away the pain!","261012":"If Aunt Maggie won't fight tooth and nail for our blood, then I'll have to go it alone.","261014":"Independence works two ways - rely on no-one, and no-one relies on you.","261015":"I have a young family whose hopes rest on a roll of the dice. But at least we have dice to roll.","261016":"Who will benefit from our defiance? All that are human.","261017":"I'm pretty good at talking my way out,  but I rarely get that luxury.","261018":"If we're such small fish, why can't they just let us swim?","261020":"I'm sure the Empire's just as bad as La Corona. Of course, I wouldn't tell Her Majesty that!","261021":"We may seem dissimilar, but Beryl and I are a lot alike.","261022":"George should consider practising what he preaches.","261023":"Archibald's 'constitution' is unconstitutional, just like every government ever.","261024":"Anne's got no code. She'll fight anyone and everyone.","261025":"I wouldn't wager a newt on Wibblesock, if he were the last egg in the pond.","261026":"At least Bente came here and heard us out, but I wouldn't want her to have to help us.","261027":"Eli Bleakworth's kind don't see beyond lines, it's all always black or white.","261028":"If Alonso cooperated, we'd have this place for ourselves. But he's crazy, insane!","261029":"Lady Margaret? I'd be surprised if she didn't have her moments of madness.","261030":"Gasparov's French is impressive, from the outside at least.","261031":"This rock's for the worst of the worst, you'll not find a goodly soul upon it!","261032":"All Her Majesty asks of me, is that I keep the peace.","261033":"I've got better things to do than bleat with you over H.M.'s rotten biscuits and insipid tea.","261034":"The chimpanzees can swing about as much as they like inside— good practice for the gallows.","261035":"Give 'em an inch, they take a mile. They even have their own cells now!","261036":"Do I condemn you now, or merely give you a length of rope with which to strangle yourself?","261037":"Malching must know that crime never pays.","261038":"If I could break one of Beryl's urchins, we'd have her head in the gibbet.","261039":"I don't think Sir Archibald has the stomach for my work.","261040":"I saw Benjamin Harlow drop, and will see his pirate niece Anne hang just the same!","261041":"Anne Harlow proves even the nobility can be corrupted by the Devil.","261042":"Jean LaFortune should stop gambling on his life, and hand himself in.","261043":"Is it only Madame Kahina's prices that are criminal, or is there some truth to these rumours about her past?","261044":"Sarmento is a myth, or we'd have had her in for interrogation long ago.","261045":"Admiral Silva serves a different Empire, and is therefore not in my jurisdiction.","261046":"Graves will be caught, and when he is he will pay the maximum possible penalty.","261047":"This is a new life for me, I still have luxury, without any of the danger.","261048":"I don't know if the Queen knows what a burden power over life and death becomes.","261049":"People see what they want to see. As the years pass, I've learned to play on those assumptions.","261050":"It's better to hold on to your secrets, I can tell you that for free.","261051":"I'm expecting a javelin through the back at any moment.","261052":"Can bad actions have good reasons? I try not to think about it anymore.","261053":"Archie's mind is a lot sharper than he lets on.","261054":"Isabel and her people want change, only fools aren't open to that.","261055":"For Isabel, I'd moonlight again, if only to remember how it feels.","261056":"Maybe Old Nathaniel doesn't know, but the spirit of the dead lives on in their possessions.","261057":"Eli thinks everyone has to suffer for justice to be done.","261058":"Vicente is paranoid I study the book of Judith.","261059":"I'll join them again in the fields... my brothers and sisters, once we have set this land free.","261060":"Jean is reckless like my brother was. I don't blame him. He is only trying to survive, to protect the ones he loves.","261061":"I was young when I joined the movement, I never imagined I would one day be giving the orders.","261062":"This is not about revenge, but securing our people a future free of La Corona. We have to stick together.","261063":"My brother fought back violently against La Corona. He was murdered. We have to try another way.","261064":"If we strike against La Corona, we have to make it count!","261065":"Let Admiral Silva cling to his dying dream, we hear the little birds of freedom sing!","261066":"La Corona may be our enemy, not the Queen, but to trust empire for us is impossible.","261067":"If Anne Harlow could forget the past, we could build a better future together.","261068":"Alonso is a powder keg. He threatens to destroy the delicate balance we've worked so hard for.","261069":"Madame Kahina is the best. Quick, clean, and never draws attention. How does she do it?","261070":"George dances well for an invalid, we all need to cut free sometimes.","261072":"I took this command because it has always been my destiny. Under my leadership, La Corona shall once more be victorious.","261073":"Apparently my father disliked babies. I think I shall be as decisive, but slightly less mad.","261074":"Lady Margaret Hunt, née Harlow, is a respected voice on the Royal Council.","261075":"It doesn't matter what you think of me, it is what I think of you.","261076":"Archie has been like a father to me, his company fills me with all those paternal hopes and comforts.","261077":"Archie never stops me eating jam, and will suffer the subsequent indigestion for me too!","261078":"If not for Archie, the rest would still be leading me up and down stairs like an infant.","261079":"Sarmento is a strong woman, let us hope she keeps no secrets from us.","261080":"Anne Harlow must know that no injustice can excuse her own crimes.","261081":"Jean La Fortune is a pirate whose name I too-commonly hear.","261082":"The council has agreed my prison reforms, so I hope Mr. Bleakworth will bend a little.","261083":"Miss Jorgensen is a distant relative. Although all my relatives are quite distant.","261084":"I understand we have visiting royalty in Princess Qing. She's a gentle soul.","261085":"Willie Wibblesock? A made-up name surely?!","261086":"It's Mr von Malching. I will never offer that awful man a barony.","261088":"The presence of Vicente Silva is clearly an attempt by La Corona to challenge my authority here.","261089":"Semaphore stations'll soon be disused - there's a tip for old iron.","261090":"Isabel's people are resistors, fighting for their Ohms.","261091":"Found an egg with a palace in it. Fixed the hinge and stuck it on the bow of my lady blimp.","261092":"Zeppelins'll take off, you'll see. Soon they'll all want a piece of my lady blimp.","261093":"Turn a greasy hat inside out, and it looks to 'ave been oiled purposely!","261094":"Coffins make nice boats. But make sure the lid doesn't shut on you.","261095":"I could use George Smith's bath chair, once he's gone. Can't be long now can it?","261096":"Archibald Blake commissioned the Queen a balloon, then he realised it was all a lot of hot air.","261097":"The Queen may have snatched every last bit of land and sea, but I have the skies to meself.","261098":"Alonso's good to follow at a distance; for all the leftovers.","261099":"That windsock Willie still complaining? The lad doesn't know his luck.","261100":"Don't dabble with Kahina, she's a lethal businesswoman.","261101":"I offered Bente a place on my balloon, but she guffawed and called it cheating!","261102":"I shouldn't have to play second fiddle to anyone.","261103":"I ride my Phaeton more and more often to the palace, I'm in great demand with Queen and council you see.","261104":"Goode & Sons has a future among the constellations, not in petty ship trades!","261105":"I was born for this age. With my Olympian ideas, my industry, my sacrifice, all is possible!","261106":"Why should his passion and ambition count against a man?","261107":"The responsibility could weigh heavy, but I am more than equal, much more.","261108":"Naturally I deal with Sir Archibald; it's his duty to greet Her Majesty's proudest subjects.","261109":"Isabel Sarmento? Never heard of her.","261110":"I'm watching you. Any suspicious behaviour will be reported immediately to Eli.","261111":"Samuel was always so suspicious of Lady Hunt, but she has a seat on the royal council for goodness' sake!","261112":"If only I had the invitingly empty sort of paper for writing, not lined, for accounting.","261113":"Fictions only remind me how little of my own writing I've done lately.","261114":"If ever I seem far away, remember so were you, those long years.","261115":"One should get to know one's kin, shouldn't one?","261116":"Getting things done bright and early maintains discipline for the remaining day.","261117":"After a jam scone at teatime, I feel a different person. That is to say, a sympathetic one.","261118":"I can't see how any woman finds calisthenics remotely emancipating.","261119":"I have to make do with living vicariously through your exploits.","261120":"The land of many rivers shall see me again, when all is forgiven.","261121":"Old pal, don't you find it strange they keep the recipe for sausage so secret?!","261122":"If the body is the field in which the mind works, would you farm on barren soil?","261123":"Do not incite violence. Prepare for it.","261124":"The music here is fine, but it lacks the colour of a raga.","261125":"I vowed to defend you, it requires no explanation.","261126":"Compared to what brought us together, this is nothing, old pal.","261127":"We met in war; we will find ourselves there again. We must be prepared for that moment.","261128":"Perhaps this island is as yet unclaimed?","261129":"Does this land belong to your Queen, or may I...?","261130":"I wish to found a new kingdom here.","261131":"Could this be my lucky island!?","261132":"If you don't want it, you should share it.","261133":"This one doesn't look too scary, d'you mind?","261136":"When loved ones pass away, it helps to keep yourself occupied with joyful things!","261137":"I knew the moment we met, the jolly royal council would come around to you!","261138":"I for one hope you uncover proof of your father's innocence!","261140":"If you need counsel during the trial, my door is always open.","261141":"There's been a dreadful misunderstanding, it's now I need your support most.","261142":"Perhaps you can convince them; all I want is peace!","261144":"I see. You have come home to great responsibility, and I have left home with it.","261145":"I am also keen to work with the Queen. Perhaps one day you will help arrange a meeting?","261146":"Isabel's rebellion I think, is the first I understand. But the Pyrphorian danger is greatly to be feared.","261147":"I am very curious to see your legal process in action!","261148":"Sorry your father's dead. I remember when I lost me old mum; always think of her when things are going wrong.","261149":"Like you, I'd do anything for the Queen. Reminds me of me mum. Younger et cetera, but you know, intimidating.","261150":"I hear stories about those Pyrphorians that have me tossing and turning til daybreak.","261151":"Cor, that Edvard eh? Deserves a really nasty end!","261152":"Don't let them judge you by your father's actions; you're your own person.","261153":"I hear you're building warships—arms dealer to the Empire…","261154":"Isabel remains fundamentally good. You can trust her to seek out truth.","261155":"No greater punishment exists for your Uncle Edvard than a fair trial.","261156":"Watch out. There'll be trouble on the way if you start stirring in the pond.","261157":"So you think you're high society now you're in with the Queen?","261158":"Oh, now you've stirred up the old hornet’s nest.","261159":"I always try to avoid the courtroom whenever I can.","261160":"Your family is infamous, but it's not all about you and your father, you know.","261161":"A pity, isn't it? Vulgar warships are scarcely the sort of royal commission I'd want.","261162":"The colonies are a distraction for the distracted.","261163":"Glad my bespoke silverware is finally safe.","261164":"Father failed you too, did he? You'll want to restore your family's soiled name.","261165":"Edvard's right, where is our royal fleet commission?","261166":"Of course, only a fool would have let Prosperity slip in the first place. The clue is in the name!","261167":"Family only ever hold us back.","261168":"So, your father was a traitor, eh? Sounds like my sort of fellow!","261169":"Why lose your head over a family scandal, when you could be losing it in so much more interesting ways?!","261170":"Welcome to the jungle!","261171":"Wow, your family is really messed up!","261172":"You're lucky your family's treachery is not pertinent to La Corona.","261173":"If the Empire is building a fleet, I better start building one too…","261174":"Sarmento is a sworn enemy of La Corona. One day we will deal with her rabble once and for all.","261175":"If real justice were done, Prosperity would still belong to La Corona, like back in the old days!","261176":"A terrible shame, what happened to your father, dear child.","261177":"You could be the star all of us have so long waited for.","261178":"Chasing after the past won't make you happy, my dear. Let it go—ring in the future!","261179":"I imagine the Queen naively thinks the trial might restore some of her authority.","261180":"My father gave his life to his king. Your father gave his life to his Queen. Still they're never sated.","261181":"You'd fight the crown if you knew the truth, not crawl beneath it.","261182":"Say hello to my old mate Jean, won't yer?","261183":"My father never had the privilege of a trial. Your Queen's father near strung him up himself.","261186":"Believe me, I share Isabel's cause, but I already have enough trouble with the Empire.","261188":"We can't deny it's a difficult time. The sale of Prosperity was highly destabilising for Her Majesty.","261192":"I've no doubt corruption runs in the family, and I'll be watching you closely.","261193":"Don't drag me into your conspiracy theories. Everybody knows your father was a crook.","261194":"If you weed out a single Pyrphorian you are to bring them to me first for questioning! Is that understood?","261196":"I may have known your father as a good man, but I don't know you at all.","261198":"Be careful out there. The rainforest is full of surprises.","261199":"Justice, revenge—the truth is never black and white.","261200":"If you do not fulfil our alliance, I fear it will be a humiliation.","261201":"Please aid me as you promised, and dispel this nightmare!","261202":"Were you expecting celebrations and a fatted calf on your return?","261206":"I'm in a war with your mate, but I think I know where your loyalties lie.","261208":"I'm at war with your ally. I appreciate this may be a difficult choice.","261209":"This isn't the nice sort of surprise is it?","261210":"I admit, a mafia is not very Jorgensen.","261212":"You and I share lifelong passions for discovery!","261214":"Your researches make me jump.","261231":"Started a little war with your friend, hope that won't turn the milk sour between us?","261320":"I declared war on your friend; guarantee they will be your friend no longer!","261321":"I clash with your vile acquaintance; will you follow in fashion?","261322":"I am about to hurt your friend. Wanna join in?","261323":"I have declared war on your ally, so you'd better choose carefully.","261352":"I have no choice but to punish your friend, but that is no reason for us to quarrel.","261356":"You're not involved in the mafia, are you?","261357":"It seems I had unexpected visitors!","261358":"Maybe I shouldn't go away so often…","261359":"I'm sure you knew nothing about these creeps.","261360":"It must have been the trustees.","261361":"But surely you don't think I would ever…?","261362":"Say you haven't lost trust in the Trust?","261363":"Oh why are my trustees such awful people!","261364":"You are dreaming up a brighter future!","261365":"Hurrah for science!","261366":"Your finger is very firmly on the pulse.","261367":"Isn't it all a bit sudden?","261368":"You skirt behind the curtain, knife in hand.","261369":"Shadows lift the window latch.","261370":"I found an alien bee among my flowers.","261371":"A strange fish was swimming with the shoal.","261372":"Mountains know which are the pure-hearted snowflakes.","261373":"It is my mother who pulls these strings.","261374":"I wished only to observe.","261375":"We are merely curious.","261376":"It is my mother the Empress, who embraces deception.","261377":"I feared the Empress would be displeased, if I did not send them.","261378":"I find your inventiveness fascinating.","261379":"I believe your future will blossom.","261380":"These strange concepts are inspiring.","261381":"You do not innovate, but imitate.","261382":"Technology is a form of greed.","261383":"Do not seek to improve nature.","261384":"Going behind me back, that is so naughty, that is!","261385":"I found 'em, you're in big trouble, you is!","261386":"Et tu Brute? Stab your old mate Wibbly?","261387":"Don't you start haunting me with your phantoms!","261388":"So…you're part of the mafia as well?","261389":"I am master of shadows! What do you mean you found 'em?","261390":"I honestly have no idea who they were.","261391":"Honour bright, I'll never do it again.","261392":"Means we're both as cunning as each other then, eh!","261393":"Don't reach up my sleeves, that is the first rule!","261394":"Cor science and all that? You're a braver one than I.","261395":"Nice science! Bit complicated though, innit?","261396":"Ooh, researching new tricks?","261397":"An apple fell on my head too, and it bloody hurt!","261398":"Science cheapens magic!","261399":"A magician NEVER reveals his secrets.","261400":"Your moles have always been blind.","261401":"What are all these flies on my walls?!","261402":"They may as well have had 'spy' written on their foreheads!","261403":"I prefer to have things out in the open.","261404":"I knew I didn't trust you.","261405":"You can't hide the truth forever.","261406":"Sharing ideas, nothing more.","261407":"I meant no disrespect.","261408":"You can't blame me for disbelieving.","261409":"I should know, trust works both ways.","261410":"Ah, a scholar of the sciences?","261411":"You look toward the future, as I do.","261412":"Innovation can realise our dream.","261413":"No one likes a know-it-all.","261414":"You have science, but no spirit.","261415":"Science and war often ride out together.","261416":"Now what do we have here?","261417":"I have eyes everywhere, dearie.","261418":"I know my urchins by face, and that's not one of them.","261419":"Curiosity killed the cat.","261420":"Yer a slippery snake in the pond y'are.","261421":"For every scamp you catch, there'll be three you've missed.","261422":"He can't be a spy; he's just a little boy.","261423":"One of mine? No, that can't be!","261424":"Me run a mafia? You must be mad.","261425":"Ah well, worth a sneaky try!","261426":"If yer can keep it to yerself, wonderful.","261427":"Don't let anybody sabotage yer genius.","261428":"Me regulars speak only of your advancement.","261429":"Yer think you can keep all those ideas to yerself?!","261430":"Why couldn't you give old Beryl the lowdown?","261431":"I hope you are going to share all yer fine ideas?","261432":"Seems I have a secret admirer!","261433":"I know every possible alcove.","261434":"A poor use of shadow.","261435":"I accept no imitations.","261436":"I've seen through your masquerade.","261437":"I have to keep up with trends somehow.","261438":"Virtuosos need their muses.","261439":"It's important to explore different spaces.","261440":"Great art takes inspiration where it can.","261441":"One has to stay in touch.","261442":"Science really is the art nouveau!","261443":"New techniques can freshen things up, certainly.","261444":"A scientific verticality!","261445":"I have no time for modernism.","261446":"Progress at the expense of beauty.","261447":"Buried in the future, you lose the zeitgeist.","261448":"Dabbling in disorganised crime?!","261449":"Who do you think you are, the scarlet pimple-nel?","261450":"Industrial sabotage!","261451":"Bamboozle me?!","261452":"Your blind mice have lost their tails!","261453":"How the devil did you find out!?","261454":"That is business these days.","261455":"Can't you see, everyone has spies!","261456":"Take my deception as a compliment!","261457":"No! No!! The fool was caught!","261458":"Your scientific dabbling is paying off.","261459":"Your science fixation doesn't look so freakish now!","261460":"Your ghoulish experimentations bear sublime fruit.","261461":"I should have the most fecund laboratories!","261462":"Why aren't my squares that brilliant?!","261463":"I want to profit from the scientific sphere!","261464":"Skulk in shade, guillotine blade.","261465":"Hide like a coward!","261466":"I have a sneaking suspicion…","261467":"Your emissaries curl like salted slugs.","261468":"I have blunted your dagger of espion.","261469":"Tentacles grow back.","261470":"I must be omnipresent.","261471":"They are my feelers, my antennae.","261472":"They foreshadow the coming frenzy.","261473":"Thank you for returning my cloak and dagger.","261474":"Science gives you new tools. I like new tools.","261475":"Your progress really gave me a jolt.","261476":"I also like to experiment.","261477":"I could make you my guinea pig?","261478":"Yet you fail to answer the fundamental questions.","261479":"I prefer practise to theory.","261480":"What are you hiding from?","261481":"Afraid to fight in the open?","261482":"Only cowards skulk in the shadows.","261483":"It's laughable you thought I wouldn't notice.","261484":"I've uncovered your little plot.","261485":"One of my scouts losing their way, that's all.","261486":"It was merely counter-espionage.","261487":"An inexcusable failure of my intelligence service.","261488":"Another slapdash infiltration.","261489":"It's your fault I'm suspicious in the first place.","261490":"Science can improve the economy and our quality of life.","261491":"I admire a good breakthrough.","261492":"Innovation is absolutely essential.","261493":"Your advances can't disguise your shoddy leadership.","261494":"I wait for the right moment before I advance.","261495":"Stop trying to get ahead!","261496":"So, you take pleasure in a masquerade?","261497":"There's no need for secrecy, I've nothing to hide.","261498":"So unnecessary, when all is out in the open.","261499":"Oh, then you don't trust me?","261500":"Come child, no need to hide your true feelings.","261501":"They are many and everywhere.","261502":"How silly to think I would hide something from you.","261503":"You see, we are all drawn to your remarkable aura.","261504":"I'm glad you found them, it shows you are on your guard.","261505":"How clever of you to have discovered them.","261506":"Most prudent to look to the future.","261507":"You young things with your wild ideas.","261508":"Your advances show a wisdom beyond your years.","261509":"Experiments will often go frightfully wrong.","261510":"You meddle in what you don't understand.","261511":"Stay clear of the laboratory if you want to avoid a nasty accident.","261512":"I'll smash something of yours soon enough.","261513":"I'm fighting your ally, save time and say I can drown you both.","261514":"I'd rather fight without you, but we had an agreement.","261515":"Just 'cos I fight for you, doesn't make us friends.","261516":"Come here at your peril.","261517":"I told you to stay away, or do you need you ears opening?","261518":"Not even death can make us happy.","261519":"Their blood'll beat while your heart still does.","261520":"Come on, that's an inanimate object!","261521":"Will you protect me and my family as you said you would?","261522":"It is a big risk for us, but oui, we will fight for you.","261523":"They pray morning and evening this war will end.","261524":"We desire only to defend these properties and the families that inhabit them.","261525":"War is bad for you, we have allies everywhere.","261526":"They'll lay down arms the moment you make a fair peace offer.","261527":"We are at war with your ally, let us see your true colours.","261529":"Unite! Unite!","261530":"I feel… most unwell.","261533":"Take the streets!","261534":"That's my boy in there!","261535":"My daughter… her forehead is burning!","261536":"Those poor people…","261537":"Father, who are those angry people?","261538":"A-chooo! Dear me.","261539":"This climate of instability is unsustainable…","261540":"Smoke can be seen for miles around.","261542":"This vile ague spells the end...","261551":"Fetid, festering filth.","261552":"Should've seen her face!","261553":"Fancy an ale after work?","261554":"It can never be replaced...","261555":"These daguerrotypes haven't really come out…","261556":"Gears completely corroded!","261557":"Things did seem to be moving speedily.","261558":"What a scam!","261559":"Hey, careful with that!","261561":"No slacking!","261562":"Fetch another cart boy, be quick.","261563":"A few too many weeds, but we're getting there.","261564":"No great shakes…","261565":"And it took so very long to arrive.","261566":"Where did you say you'd come from?","261567":"Oh, they're just adorable!","261568":"Rather have it with roast potatoes and a rich sauce.","261569":"A portal to a lost world!","261570":"All I can see is a fat patina of dust.","261571":"Have you heard? We're at war.","261572":"Good tidings from the front!","261573":"Sound the alarm!","261574":"No-one leaves Wormways in a hurry.","261575":"I worry for our relations with the South.","261576":"Wi! Keep it under wraps.","261577":"When will his children step from the shadow?","261578":"Is it just the wind that howls at night...?","261579":"I've got it all over my hands now!","261580":"That fish pie smells gurt lush.","261581":"Broken glass all over the blimmin linoleum.","261582":"I swear! I saw a spectre upon the stair!","261583":"Accompany me along the promenade?","261584":"Anything show up on the thermogram?","261586":"I want to know if those pianoforte lessons were money well spent.","261587":"...then he leered to one side, and dropped his snuff all over the cobbles!","261588":"..and then she popped the little fondant in her mouth!","261589":"Oh but surely you've seen it? Mesmerising!","261590":"Can't believe he forgot his shovel!","261591":"It was a sumptuous spread, it really was.","261592":"Travel always makes one a little weary.","261593":"Please don't leave your crate unattended, sir.","261594":"I thought you were keeping tally?!","261595":"I really would rather return to sunlight, sweet darling.","261596":"There's a distinct whiff of powder in the air…","261597":"The outlook is unremittingly bleak.","261598":"To arms, you fools!","261599":"Can I have your leftover gruel? I'm wasting away!","261600":"Oooh! News from the palace!","261601":"Bon chance, mon ami!","261602":"Samuel Goode, go against a lifetime of piety?!","261603":"It's brought on my lumbago.","261604":"Don't even mind the neighbours.","261605":"Dreams of nuts, bolts and washers.","261606":"Cheeky flat cap, mate. Is it new?","261607":"It's the second verse that doesn't scan!","261608":"He couldn't have been more obnoxious..","261609":"So satisfying that it performs as designed.","261610":"Yes, I bumped into her at the hatter's.","261611":"Toss me a chisel.","261612":"Stand back, I would. Looks like the tubes need a flush.","261613":"Here's a fresh seam, have a swing at that boy.","261614":"There be potholes, so watch out.","261615":"I'm not certain I want to go up that enormous hill.","261616":"We're tired, papa, we want to go home!","261617":"Hark at you, back on dry land...","261618":"Extraordinary! What a majestic animal…","261619":"And people come here for fun, you say?","261620":"History always seemed such a closed book!","261621":"The drums of war can be heard.","261622":"They say we might hold out yet.","261623":"Defend our home!","261624":"Please, me shackles are a bit tight.","261625":"Have you been invited to the Duke's soirée?","261626":"A little good angel took me away to dream of a better place...","261627":"Samuel —a traitor!?","261628":"Over millennia, the Inuit have learned to adapt.","261629":"Oh, confetti!","261630":"Barn's filled with owls. We must have dormice...","261631":"Dirty rotten vandal!","261632":"I have a fitting for new boots.","261633":"The corset is a little tight…","261634":"Duppler's postulations do encourage further study.","261635":"A surfeit of tag-rag-and-bobtail!","261636":"Fell off his yacht and drowned, hilarity ensued!","261637":"Look out below!","261638":"I mean to see every exhibit, and then see them again!","261639":"Someone bring forth a light!","261640":"The painters at their easels are spoiled by these vistas.","261641":"Relaxed, and somewhat stimulated...","261642":"Your vessel shall be subject to an inspection…","261643":"Oi! Move, lad!","261644":"All my life, I have been utterly ignorant!","261645":"Rather a lot of old hat!","261646":"Dark times ahead, I wonder?","261647":"Cheer up, we're holding out!","261648":"We're going to be blown away...","261649":"Too late! Go on without me...","261650":"You spoiling for a fight?","261651":"Canapé ma'am?","261652":"I'd rather die free…","261653":"It's Edvard now, like it or not…","261654":"Perhaps the supplies rotted?","261657":"Oh mother, look!","261659":"Who's stinking like cut cheese?","261660":"Ought worth reading in the newsrag?","261661":"She said my work was mediocre!","261662":"Oh! I must write that down!","261663":"...and blew him across the laboratory! dreadful times...","261664":"See, here? The remarkable refractions of light.","261665":"Oh! Have you not been introduced?","261666":"Us simple country folk have never seen anything like it!","261667":"Be there tonight — the Union meeting.","261668":"Maybe three, four bushels? I wouldn't like to say.","261669":"It's all the more vivid from my balcony…","261670":"The bellboy showed no emotion whatsoever…","261671":"Cut-price watches, madam?","261672":"Sorry, that's as low as I go.","261673":"(laugh) Did you see what it just did?","261674":"Oh!

Let's roll up our sleeves and make a difference.","264392":"I hope you fight for our rights.","264393":"I don't usually approve of violence, but…","264394":"Sometimes we need to take action.","264395":"We should try to win hastily!","264396":"Our enemies are the tyrants!","264397":"We shall prevail for greater good!","264403":"Could they break our spirit…?","264404":"They have no scruples!","264405":"Our future is threatened!","264408":"We require electrical power!","264409":"The dream depends on electricity!","264410":"We need to feel connected!","264419":"Hallelujah.","264420":"The dream is kept alive!","264421":"Praise be for the certainties we have!","264426":"I am eternally grateful for your support.","264427":"You have proven all is still possible.","264428":"You endure where others have not.","264433":"We cannot allow this to stop us believing.","264434":"We have let a chance pass us by.","264435":"Now I feel the wind begin to bite.","264440":"Please, don't follow the Arctic Council's example.","264441":"Perhaps you don't realise the scale of this undertaking.","264442":"You don't seem as committed as the others.","264447":"I, Lady Faithful, knock at every door to rouse the bold and the daring.","264448":"You may know of my husband, Sir John Faithful whose Arctic expedition is lost and forsaken?","264449":"Be assured, your efforts will be suitably rewarded.","264450":"We must stick together if we are to endure the chill.","264451":"It cannot be long now before we find something.","264456":"The absence of a base camp might explain why the Arctic council never sustained their rescue efforts.","264457":"This encampment must embody hope, our one comfort in the wilderness.","264460":"Until the fate of any lost ship is affirmed, our efforts should not diminish.","264461":"Many ships from many sponsors, united by a profound desire to bring back those men alive.","264464":"Just when I was beginning to lose faith.","264465":"If we pull together like this, who knows what we can achieve.","264466":"We must thank the Inuit spirits who dwell here.","264467":"We can do it.","264468":"Yes, I fear we must.","264469":"Yes, we must set our preconceptions aside.","264470":"It would only make me worry.","264471":"Something urges me not to.","264472":"It's impossible.","264496":"I'm very grateful.","264497":"You are doing marvellous work.","264498":"Your generosity won't be forgotten.","264542":"We must rally together now, if we are to find them.","264543":"I value any help I can get, from any direction.","264544":"You will be rewarded, I promise.","264547":"Good, we all are with you.","264548":"Thank you.","264550":"They said it was impossible, you proved them wrong!","264551":"You have survived the elements!","264555":"Was the reward not substantial enough?","264556":"What could have led you astray?","264557":"Seems we've not learned from the mistakes of the past.","264558":"The cold has got to us.","264560":"The Arctic summer is only a brief window.","264561":"We don't have much time.","264563":"It does not end there, we must keep going.","264564":"This must be a sustained effort.","264565":"I know it feels like going from one pole to another.","264569":"Have you something?","264570":"Something to give us hope?","264572":"I await news of our next compass heading.","264573":"The matter is out of our hands for the time being.","264578":"The most ambitious rescue I've had the honour to be part of.","264579":"I hoped and feared I might one day have the privilege of such an undertaking.","264580":"Can we do worse than the Arctic council? They're afraid of the ice in their whisky!","264581":"I will not rest while fellow seamen succumb to the cold, we are with you!","264582":"The Northwest passage is uncharted, Admiral. More than preparation, we need luck.","264583":"I don't want to join the many that tried and failed to find them.","264584":"It's a cairn o'rocks stacked by human hand! We have stumbled upon Sir John Faithful's last encampment!","264585":"We've found no trace of Sir John and his crew, let us hope there is time to try again.","264586":"We must be better prepared if we are to follow in the fateful footsteps of Sir John.","264587":"I knew another captain who ventured this far north, but I know him no more.","264588":"We all know this could be our last expedition, so may it be a fine one!","264589":"If we die in the attempt, it won't be for a lack of commitment.","264590":"It'll be the stuff of folklore if we succeed and bring back Sir John.","264591":"Bears, vicious whales and restless spirits await us, if the tales are to be believed.","264592":"It's a lot to ask, but to a seaman there's no challenge to rival the Arctic.","264593":"A wise seaman would trust the Inuits. They know their land better than we ever will.","264594":"I myself have little experience of the Arctic, but stand beside you.","264595":"Seaman's intuition tells me they came this way, but I've been wrong before.","264596":"I fear we may be as lost as the original expedition.","264597":"Let's hope we warm mother nature's frozen heart soon.","264598":"The chill already gnaws at the bones of our crew.","264599":"If I know Sir John Faithful right, I'd say he came this way.","264600":"You made a seal hole, now catch a seal!","264601":"If these men seem impervious to cold, it's Lady Faithful's fire we have to thank.","264602":"I've met few so hardy as Lady Faithful, we can't let her down now.","264603":"And I thought the Arctic Council's efforts were pathetic.","264604":"We might have turned back long ago, had the mysteries of the ice not drawn us in.","264605":"Even I have rarely seen such extremes, and worse may be yet to come.","264606":"We cannot be too thorough in our preparations, yet we must also be swift.","264607":"We must make waves, channel my John's spirit of adventure.","264608":"Because we have failed now, does not mean I shall give up hope.","264609":"We didn't even get close, and yet I sense they are there, all of them.","264610":"We will not make the same mistakes other rescuers did.","264611":"We have the chance to save what otherwise might be lost to the ice forever.","264612":"This is a matter in which I have a deep personal interest.","264614":"Among the many others, my dearest Sir John, is lost to the ice.","264615":"Signs they were there? The search may begin in earnest!","264616":"The Faithful Expedition shall be the success that no other ever was.","264617":"We must be ready for all eventualities, this shall be no small endeavour.","264618":"The Inuit will know something, I intend to seek their insight at the earliest opportunity.","264619":"We should approach these preparations with clarity of purpose.","264620":"I dream of seeing us cut through the ice like a hot knife through butter!","264621":"I will not rest until the lost expedition are fed, bathed in hot salts and tucked up in their beds.","264622":"I can neglect not one supply that may prove useful in an icy wasteland.","264623":"We cannot underinvest in provisions and equipment.","264624":"We cannot rely on Inuit knowledge alone, we must have our own expertise.","264625":"We need the best minds to have any dream of succeeding.","264626":"The least I can save is my husband's reputation, if indeed he has found a northwest passage.","264627":"Glorious it is when wandering time comes.","264628":"If you walk on thin ice, you may as well dance.","264629":"Be the lead dog, and show where to go.","264630":"Find this seal hole.","264631":"Watch out for bears.","264632":"To ignore the wisdom of the Inuit is an arrogance we cannot afford.","264633":"The Arctic Council disregarded Inuit expertise and it got them nowhere!","264634":"The strong qimmiq pulls through.","264635":"You have a good nose.","264636":"It is easy to underestimate this place.","264637":"This is a harsh land.","264638":"We should do what we can to survive.","264639":"I am relieved not all misunderstand the Inuit as you do.","264640":"We should take gifts when they are offered.","264641":"We waste no chance we have here.","264642":"Now is your time.","264643":"That was only the beginning.","264644":"The day is young, there is more to do.","264645":"Do you share with the hunting party?","264646":"Should I heat some tea?","264647":"There is nothing more to be said.","264648":"It is a time of silence.","264649":"Temperatures will not favour us for long.","264650":"The Faithful Expedition is in dire need of that Icebreaker.","264651":"The Arctic Council thought breaking the ice impossible too, yet someone has clearly managed it!","264652":"It shows we have conquered our fear.","264653":"Seems the balance is restored.","264654":"These are good signs.","264655":"Let us show the Arctic Council we do not give up on anyone.","264656":"They underestimated the power of nature, but I cannot watch them be punished for it.","264657":"We cannot all hope to best the elements, as the council themselves are always keen to point out.","264658":"There is much to be afraid of now.","264659":"You have done well, and you smell nice.","264660":"You have damaged the balance of things.","264661":"When the ice breaks, I want you there with me.","264662":"The wolf has kept you strong, caribou.","264663":"I must consult the spirit now.","264664":"It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.","264665":"You are meddling in witchcraft.","264666":"You have let many people down.","264667":"A shaman must help those in need. We will share what we know.","264668":"We were afraid you would come for them. Now you are here we must help you.","264669":"To know where you are going, you have to know where you come from.","264670":"An annuraaq should be watertight.","264671":"A fur hood would help shake the snow from your face.","264672":"We do not camp anywhere long, the season changes fast.","264673":"The igluit are made with anything we can find.","264674":"During the long dark winter, we will play games and tell stories.","264675":"Seal is important to us, we are careful to waste no part of it.","264676":"Take only the whale and bear that you need.","264678":"We still have much to learn from the Inuit, if we are to succeed the next time.","264679":"I thought together we could do it, I hope one day I can still be proven right.","264680":"May we repay this kindness.","264681":"We are thankful.","264682":"Nakurmiik; thank you.","264683":"Yes.","264684":"Ee.","264685":"Good.","264686":"Not good.","264687":"I am sorry.","264688":"Nakka.","264689":"May you have warmth in your iglu.","264690":"May you have oil in your lamp.","264691":"Go with peace in your heart.","264692":"Coming here, I realise the frightening scale of what lies ahead of us.","264693":"The ice is as old as time, and more stubborn than I'd ever have believed.","264694":"Though it is their own expedition they abandon, the Arctic Council shows no sign of contrition.","264695":"I am more worried than ever for the wellbeing of my husband's crew.","264696":"The Council's hubris coming here, expecting the unconquerable to be conquered!","264697":"How underprepared we are for mother nature! Only a seasonal lull gives us any hope at all.","264698":"My husband is a stubborn man, I only hope he was not too proud to heed the Inuit.","264699":"We have broken through ancient Ice, can I yet be hopeful?","264700":"These narrow channels will thicken solid, if we wait any longer.","264701":"How can they have survived in such a pitiless climate?","264702":"What if their provisions failed? Surely then they'd have been grateful for seals from the Inuit?","264703":"It was the Arctic Council who chose my dearest John, for all his flaws.","264704":"My husband's preparations were meticulous, I only hope he was willing to adapt them.","264705":"What snow-monsters lie in wait, I dare not speculate.","264706":"We must bridge with the Inuit. Perhaps they would trade?","264707":"Our survival hinges on partnership with the Inuit, we must reach out to them somehow.","264709":"The blinding whiteness. I hope I shall be worthy of its grandeur.","264710":"Dinner with the admiralty, is my sum experience of the Arctic, yet now here I am.","264711":"Stone cairns, and signs they camped in this very spot!","264712":"An auspicious place for us to make camp, knowing they too were here.","264713":"We must set up some chain of supply here— who knows how long a search will take.","264714":"Any provisions or equipment we can find will be beneficial to us!","264716":"Are we too late? Is it too late for us too now?","264717":"We are close, I sense them; my John - all of them.","264718":"Follow their aura, as others have done, and we can still find them.","264742":"If it takes our last breath we must find those walkers!","264743":"There is nothing more to be done now, but await the fate of the others.","264744":"That howling! They must long to be found!","264745":"We must strive onward, if it be the end of us.","264746":"This is the end, we must give ourselves to it fully.","264749":"We must trust the visions of the Inuit, and hope.","264750":"They must have been desperate to forsake the comfort of their cabins.","264751":"That John was not among them matters not, my belief has returned that he roams the ice yet.","264752":"Where are the bodies, if they are all dead?","264753":"Better to find skulls, than nothing at all.","264754":"We should dignify their memory with burial.","264755":"What madness caused them to forsake their equipment?","264756":"New life already clings to the wreckage of the old.","264757":"I can hear them, see their light everywhere!","264758":"The pole star gleams on bone.","264759":"The northland calls us through its open gate.","264760":"It's as if we are on a different plane, where souls reside.","264761":"The Inuit spoke of souls, I think I understand now.","264762":"We must hold fast, the truth will embrace us soon.","264771":"Skins can be sewn into clothing with bone needles.","264772":"You need a lot of good fat to reach the heart of ice.","264773":"So many sacrifices, but we have brought the survivors home!","264774":"That so many lives have been saved gives me hope anew.","264775":"I fear they went looking for the heart of ice. We have not seen them for a long time.","264776":"I can set you on a path, the rest is down to you.","264777":"If you tread carefully, then perhaps a way can be found.","264778":"That is the way. Their breath still hangs in the air.","264779":"Without belief, answers do not yet exist.","264780":"I don't know if your icebreaker will vanquish the ice, but we will not stand in your way.","264781":"None of us have much time.","264782":"You need to make the best of all you have.","264783":"Such strength can redeem your people.","264784":"This place is all-powerful, ever-changing, you have to adapt.","264785":"We have sighted vessels stranded in the channels. They too will be lost without help.","264786":"Better to let others learn from their own mistakes.","264787":"Your countrymen will soon become snowbound, and easy prey for Akhlut.","264788":"Those men underestimated this place, but you can show them their failings.","264789":"They will be glad to come back to light and hospitality, and think on their mistakes.","264790":"Seals are everywhere; know how to look for them.","264791":"Nanurjuk says they didn't seem right. They said little as if their tongues were cut.","264792":"They refused the seals we offered them.","264793":"They would not trade, or drink soup with us.","264794":"We built them a shelter, but they were already gone, deep into the ice.","264795":"Never have I seen beings so pale.","264796":"They went beyond the old ice, to a place of danger.","264797":"We are afraid Anguta has taken them to the underworld.","264798":"There are many ways to survive here, we have learned since childhood.","264799":"I will trade with you.","264800":"We were scared they were possessed by demons.","264801":"They brought sickness with them, and devilry.","264802":"We knew you would come for them, we have been waiting for you.","264803":"If these are indeed humans you pursue, I will do all I can to help you.","264804":"There are many things I could tell you, but I don't think they will help.","264805":"There are many sea mammals here, Sedna is their keeper.","264806":"We do not meddle in the business of others.","264807":"Don't expect to learn everything in a day.","264808":"The Council have praised our knowledge, but never respected it.","264809":"The vessels you seek are near yet far. Best prepare for terror.","264810":"If their vessels drifted to a dark place, maybe they are there still.","264811":"They could not have escaped the channels, you will find them there.","264812":"We too want answers, you are brave to keep digging.","264813":"This is a place of death. You can die here without knowing.","264814":"I will not go with you. I hope it is men you find, at the end of your journey.","264815":"When wise men die, the heavens lament.","264816":"You are on the last floe now, but the most fragile.","264817":"You have brought men back from the edge, you have earned our respect.","264818":"If you cannot save them, their souls will be trapped in the upper world to starve for eternity.","264819":"The lights in the sky cleave heads from the unworthy.","264820":"Where the ice between the dead and the living is thinnest, you float across.","264821":"I have no power to protect you, when you go to that place.","264822":"You have stirred the wrath of the moon!","264823":"Do not hunt alone, in darkness, or the wolf will take you.","264824":"This is a celestial place, be wary of taboo.","264825":"Fear this place, or it will take you smiling.","264826":"Nanook decides if you may hunt, or if you violate this place.","264827":"Inuksuk said he saw the white people carrying human meat.","264828":"I remember they were so dirty,  they had lost all humanity.","264829":"If you hear a whistling, it is their ghosts, trapped in the upper world.","264842":"I'm back from the dead, and I've brought friends.","264843":"Ain't you learned by now, I'm unkillable!","264844":"I decide when I die thank you.","264845":"This time, I'm going to get in with the right people.","264846":"We've rebuilt before, we can do it again.","264847":"The past is the past, the future is ours to protect.","264848":"You're going to need your best ship and crew, only for it to sink to the icy bottom! Hehehe.","264849":"Terrible waste of human life of course, but don't let that stop you.","264850":"And be sure to prepare for the final curtain while you're at it.","264851":"You really do have quite the desire to depart don't ya? Well it's your funeral.","264852":"Never mind, eh! At least you won't die a block of ice.","264853":"Seems a long way to go to die, but you look ready for it.","264854":"Take your time, won't make a difference to Sir John.","264855":"Congratulations! You crossed seven seas for a wasteland!","264856":"Couldn't even shoot yerself in the foot? Well I feel sorry for ya.","264857":"The whole expedition's a failure. But we all know that teamwork drivel's a myth.","264858":"See— never worth getting mixed up in other people's business.","264859":"What a waste of time! Just goes to show, you can't rely on others.","264860":"There's nothing up there but the  ruddy cold.","264861":"Hoping this will keep your head above water? Not Arctic water it won't.","264862":"Dunno why you're so desperate for your eyeballs to freeze.","264863":"At best we'll be pulling stiffs out the ice like teeth.","264864":"Like frostbite do ya? Botulism? Scurvy? Got that all to look forward to.","264865":"The Arctic's no more than a mariner's graveyard. Ooh, hang fire...","264866":"As we're here, we might ask the Inuits if they chanced upon any lost property...","264867":"The equipment won't have decomposed like the cadavers.","264868":"We've a responsibility to Sir John to gather up his valuables.","264869":"Hard to feel the cold when you see a glint, ain't it? Hehe.","264870":"Found nothing but emptiness, why isn't I surprised?","264871":"The deeper we go, the more likely we find something really juicy.","264872":"You want an Icebreaker, so we can get to the fancy stuff.","264873":"Never know what you'll find inside, if you don't crack things open.","264874":"Now we can finally see if Sir John bequeaths us summat shiny.","264875":"You need to grow yourself some tusks, my walrus-friend, or we'll never snag the goodies.","264876":"What d'you wanna help those old duffers for? Unless...you've sniffed summat out?","264877":"I've heard the Arctic Council ships are plushly furnished.","264878":"Shame they had to still be alive and we couldn't just help ourselves.","264879":"As long as their pocket watches still tick we should try afresh.","264880":"Never should o' come here, why do you think they call it a wasteland?","264881":"Looks like we'll have to dig up Sir John Faithful's army o' the dead another day.","264882":"Shame we couldn't find 'em, I was looking forward to expanding my collection of brass buttons.","264883":"Lady Faithful hopes to resurrect her marriage, but Sir John's got cold feet, hehehe.","264884":"Ice might even have helped preserve the merchandise.","264885":"I think we all know where Sir John Faithful is now, don't we? He's dead.","264886":"I know her old man’s long dead, but his lavish instruments won’t be, eh?","264887":"Don't be afraid to see the frozen look as you frisk their corpses, you’ll get used to it.","264888":"You can see a body a mile off out here, nice and exposed.","264889":"Knowing those old toffs, they'd probably skin each other before they'd skin a seal.","264890":"I 'spect there's a few nice bits and bobs suspended about the place.","264891":"Can't always wait til things are dead y'know...","264892":"No-one'll notice the odd body. If they're well-preserved, we could sell 'em for dissection.","264893":"Can't believe how much an Inuit'll give ya for a tarnished spoon, hehe.","264894":"I'd have come before, if I'd known how easy it is to fleece the locals.","264895":"If you're looking for the Hades and Styx, you're going in the right direction, hehe.","264896":"We can really milk this predicament for all it's got, as long as we're quiet.","264897":"Two years in a blizzard probably doesn't do your skin much good, does it?","264898":"Now, we don't want to look like we're only in it for the proceeds.","264899":"Now we're onto something. Let's hope for a shipwreck!","264900":"I hope those ships are stuck fast in the ice, free for the taking!","264901":"Ain't you wondering what's left of them ships?","264905":"Blimey, by foot!? This all looks very grim all of a sudden, doesn't it?!","264906":"Afraid? Never seen a real corpse?","264908":"If Lady Faithful thinks they're still alive let's humour the poor woman's delusion shall we?","264909":"Let's get to the bottom of this mystery, and what's become of 'em.","264910":"You'd think you'd seen a ghost, what's frozen yer?","264911":"Some of them live?! Brings a tear to an old man's eye.","264912":"Why d'you have to fade away before the final payoff!","264913":"Heavens what a name, no wonder their luck, eh?","264914":"You seem drawn to death, that's why I stick to you like fishglue.","264915":"This place is more indifferent to humankind than I am.","264916":"Cast your eyes about for any tidbits in the snow.","264917":"Lady Faithful's bewitched, she won't notice if we shuffle off for a bit.","264918":"A place so curious must have its curiosities…","264919":"What's all this endeavour of yours for?","264920":"A lot of furry animals out here.","264921":"These Inuit geezers are a help though, ain't they?","264922":"There are times even I give the dead their due.","264923":"Nothing but bone.","264924":"A sight to chill even someone as soulless as myself.","264925":"I think we could all use a tot of hot brandy.","264926":"Even I'd start to miss the sight of other beings out here.","264927":"We've come to a place of solitude.","264928":"I can't bear to watch you do this to yourself.","264929":"I thought you would end icebound too, but for your icebreaker.","264930":"Our planks stock reduces dangerously. We shall start producing our own construction materials now...","264931":"I love the scent of freshly cut wood, smells like a soon growing settlement. Very good.","264947":"Hello! I'm Hannah, your general advisor. I have some experience in building a company, which I'll share gracefully once you will have settled an island.","264948":"Hello! I'm Hannah, your general advisor. Welcome to your new home! This island will witness the beginning of our company, and I'll accompany you in this project.","264949":"Treading paths never trodden!","264950":"The thrill of discovering new horizons…!","264951":"Going on an adventure? Don't be scared if old Wibbly can also do it.","264952":"Going on an adventure? Don't be scared if old Wibbly can also do it.","264953":"We are in the middle of the sea right now. We need to settle an island to build our company. Find a huge island, that possesses all fertilities required for a good start.","264954":"We have our place now! Not bad, but it's only the beginning.","264955":"Yes, the island looks great, but don't waste more time. Start now with our company town. You need to build a settlement to attract some farmers. They will work in basic food and goods production.","264956":"Our small company city is buzzing. Farmers are flooding in the houses. They will keep gathering the core resources and goods we need.","264961":"I heard some complaints from the employees. They refuse to live in houses because they would not have any marketplace in the area. Please fix this situation!","264962":"Finally fixed. A market is the center of our city. Please remember it.","264963":"One of our production buildings is not able to deliver its goods anywhere. There should be a warehouse near every production area.","264964":"Organizing efficiently our production areas can bring us far. I'm glad the issue is fixed now.","264965":"The growth of our village triggers new demands from the farmers. Make sure to provide basic food and commodities to them, or they will leave us.","264966":"Fish does not smell good, but it does please our farmers. At least the view of the fish cargo delights me: it means more workforce, ultimately.","264967":"Our employees now are asking for schnapps. They would pay a lot for it, but this is no life requirement. They will just be a bit unhappy, that's all...","264970":"Help enough to demolish the larger ruins. Let's breathe some life into this place!","264971":"Father wouldn't have wanted us to sit on our hands while our one prospect was in such a state.","264972":"So let's gather our townsfolk and ask them to spruce the place up.","264973":"Mourning is eased now we have others for company sibling.","264974":"Your people are recovered, and desirous to proceed. Set them to it! We're going to need as much space as we can clear.","264976":"We must shelter the good, loyal people who have shown solidarity with our family.","264977":"We need every hand we can get if we are to expunge this debris.","264978":"It's been a hard day of labour for us all, we should cater to our tired, hungry people!","264979":"Let Uncle Edvard scoff. A modest island yes, but if you’re at all like Father, you’ll look beyond appearances.","264980":"Timber, very good. I’ll try not to think of the coffin.","264981":"He twists every article in his favour, at our and father’s expense!","264982":"It’s been a long, hard day. The people need to rest. And maybe wet their whistles.","264983":"What, still here? Establishing a rival company? On that dishevelled island?!","264984":"Do you remain here out of spite, or is this some futile attempt at competition?","264985":"Samuel's child, is it? Thank Heavens! I am so ashamed of every single word your uncle had me print.","264987":"Ah, Hannah remaining true to herself. Hello, I'm Aarhant, seems like you need an advisor for human-related issues. Don't listen to the bureaucrat, you should give your people what they want.","264988":"You have father’s fortitude! These people will follow you as they once followed him.","264989":"We have to set personal feelings aside and do as Edvard asks.","264990":"Speak to our humble cousin! He writes of a worker riot in Bright Sands.","264991":"It seems we are not alone in our contempt for Edvard.","264994":"Even I am astonished he could be this corrupt. We must put their cases before the highest authority, and hope for a retrial.","264995":"I am so relieved our legitimacy is no longer in question.","264997":"Hurry, I already smell the tar, see the masts a-swaying from father’s study!","264998":"Is there no limit to Uncle's shameless demands?","264999":"I feel sick to the stomach that Edvard could ask so much of us so soon after father's death.","265000":"That miserly, uncharitable…dastard! Picking and choosing what he inherits!","265002":"It cannot be...these names are those father trusted most; barristers, doctors, academics.","265003":"However much we despise Uncle Edvard, it's criminal to go opening his private correspondence!","265004":"He certainly knows how to silence his critics.","265005":"A letter. It bears Edvard’s seal!","265007":"As you are so desperate to appear responsible, you’ll be pleased to hear the cost of that fantastical funeral falls to you.","265008":"Your worthless rags have barely covered anything. Now bring me sails— it's not like you have any use for them!","265009":"Repay me now, or sell up!","265010":"Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, four bags full.","265011":"Good kid. Go on now, I'll let you know when I think of the next thing.","265012":"Don’t think you're finished, brat.","265013":"Well said! We have to focus on growth, not on comfort!","265014":"Your company, your policy... But be careful, angry employees may one day turn against you.","265015":"What a waste of hands... Efficient companies don't spend time on such commodities.","265016":"I totally support your decision. Making your people happy is the true sign of a good leader. Now we need to provide schnapps to these bored farmers.","265017":"Good. If you keep your employees happy, there is no way that they betray you. Oh, and it's always fun to mess up with Hannah. Remember that.","265018":"Oh you finally decided to provide this schnapps. Great. Happy employees don't think of rioting, instead they may become resourceful. We'll have an eye on it later.","265019":"Haven't seen a prison transport of mine, have you? If you do, be sure to return any salvage to me.","265021":"Don't even think about sheltering Samuel’s co-conspirators! Deliver them to prison at once, and I might lift your debt.","265022":"You have seen sense then. I suppose I shall have to inform Sir Archibald that your obligations are met.","265023":"Feels an eternity since the funeral— and the cost! Why it was extortionate!","265024":"I loathe the reek of lanolin, but if farmers smocks are all you have...","265025":"That was none of your business! And what right has the crown to meddle in my accounts? What right?!","265026":"Debt free? Spiffing, just the dib-dab. One splendid licence we shall draw up forthwith.","265027":"As to the debt my hands are tied, but it may warm her majesty's heart to see a new enterprise taking shape.","265028":"Did he really…? Oh dear, best leave these poor people with me. I will tell Edvard that the debt between you is quite settled…","265029":"If you pick me, you may have my boat! It's my poor aunt's legacy. Her second husband was a decent sailor.","265030":"Everybody on board? Good! I shiver at the thought of staying here another second…","265031":"Our city's historic first shipyard! We must document this moment in our first edition!","265032":"The perfect snapshot to illustrate history-in-the-making!","265033":"With several passionate young reporters enlisted, our publishing house is already well-underway!","265034":"Our editorial section is sure to grow along with your city. We are fine-tuning the first issue as we speak!","265035":"Think turning in sinners maketh you an angel? I know all about your family.","265036":"We’d rather die than stay. Our flags still wave for Samuel, let Edvard oppress us no more!","265037":"A life away from Edvard? We're on board! Only… we've no ship to get on board of!","265038":"We are, all of us, quite moved by your selfless actions. Your father would be proud.","265039":"Saved! Do you also then save us from a grievous injustice…?","265040":"Edvard’s charges against us are pure fabrication! The man is an impostor!","265041":"See what slander Edvard prints in Bright Sands!","265043":"The start of, if I dare presume, a most fruitful partnership!","265044":"How do you want farms to grow and raise anything? We need agricultural fields!","265045":"This scenery is so rustic. It really alters from the civilized cities. But well, our farmers have some occupation now!","265046":"I can already feel it... It's like in my dreams. Fire ravaging the city. It should not be complicated to have a fire station, or is it?","265047":"One is better than nothing, but I would feel safer if we had even more fire stations. But I should not ask too much of you...","265048":"Those houses are really too rustic... Would you mind making some renovation works?","265049":"Better housing means more qualified employees. With these workers, we will industrialize our settlement! Factory work is waiting!","265050":"Clearly Uncle's intention is to keep us from ever owning a shipyard.","265052":"Since each production building requires a specific workforce, make sure you have enough of each when you upgrade your houses. We still need some farmers.","265053":"Our dream of a shipyard is impossible without plenty of qualified hands.","265054":"Workers can handle stubborn debris on Ditchwater. If it's to be the centre of our new enterprise it needs to be immaculate.","265055":"Maybe Edvard will try to prevent us owning a shipyard, but for now let's at least house those workers.","265056":"Open the letter, he's clearly up to no good!","265061":"What is it you are bringing?","265062":"Hmm, a delivery? Dead or alive?","265063":"We are running low on timber, but there's plenty in the ruins. We should clear some to stock up.","265064":"Where are my sails!?","265093":"Our delivery driver complained that he can't access the Trading Post.","265094":"A good infrastructure is crucial to our success. Good that you improved it.","265125":"Done.","265127":"Screenshot taken.","265129":"Seriously? You're cheating?","265130":"For your information.","265131":"Game saved.","265133":"Praise checksum nine! Today is Anno day!","265134":"Will you be my Valentine?","265135":"Happy Easter!","265136":"Happy Holidays!","265137":"Merry Christmas!","265138":"Happy Halloween! Woooooo!","265139":"ANNO 1800 wishes you a happy new year.","265140":"Happy new year!","265141":"You earned a reward!","265142":"Warning!","265143":"You lost connection.","265144":"How about a cup of coffee? You have been playing for two hours.","265145":"It's four hours in a row! Time to strech your legs!","265146":"You've been playing for six hours already! Bet your empire will be fine without you for a moment or two.","265147":"You've been playing for eight hours now. You do know you can turn this off, don't you?","265148":"Time flies! It's been ten hours! And there is no time-based achievement to await you, honestly.","265149":"Twelve hours. Seriously? Turn the machine off this minute!","265150":"Twenty-four hours and the game is still running. You've reached the end of line. No more play time warnings. Let's hope you pressed fast forward and left for bed, so I am merely talking to myself right now.","265151":"Someone's cheating.","265152":"Decision required!","265153":"Player joined.","265154":"Player left.","265159":"You reached a new milestone!","265161":"Session unlocked.","265162":"New region unlocked!","265163":"New World unlocked!","265180":"The fire has been vanquished.","265181":"Your streets are safe again.","265182":"Your people are healthy again.","265189":"The strike has ended!","265190":"A fire broke out!","265191":"The fire is out of control!","265192":"The fire left ruins behind.","265193":"Your people are rioting!","265194":"This is turning into a revolution!","265195":"The revolt left your city in ruins.","265196":"Your people are starting to get sick.","265197":"The epidemic spreads across your city!","265198":"The epidemic left buildings abandoned.","265199":"People lay down their tools.","265200":"A general strike has been called on your island!","265201":"The strike left some buildings damaged.","265204":"The people celebrate your leadership!","265205":"The festival has ended!","265206":"A fire consumes one of your factories!","265207":"Illness grips one of your factories!","265208":"An explosion in one of your factories!","265210":"Ship under attack!","265211":"Your harbour is under attack!","265212":"Your city is under attack!","265213":"A ship was destroyed!","265215":"A building was destroyed!","265218":"Your island is under attack!","265220":"Your people can't hold out much longer!","265223":"Your enemy's resistance is crumbling!","265224":"Resume the attack or your siege will end!","265226":"A competitor's island is under siege.","265227":"A competitor's island withstood an

I like that!","265644":"An enemy's enemy and all that.","265645":"Skulduggery is second nature to us.","265646":"There are not many I can call friends.","265647":"If we people of principle don't support each other…","265648":"Hey, I'll play the trickster around here…","265649":"Hypocrisy is the only language the privileged speak.","265650":"Are you done kissing their feet?","265651":"Now that is a very clever thing indeed!","265652":"Do you need a lesson in manners from a pirate?","265653":"Well, that was rude.","265654":"At least try to keep your cards close to your chest!","265655":"I bet that will sting for days.","265656":"Wish I could have seen their face.","265657":"Please, don't let me stop you!","265678":"Certain traders are installed in the area. We should always have a look at what they offer for trade.","265679":"Keeping your employees happy may be highly rewarding.

All fat an sweaty in his suit!","265820":"Ah, I know, she's lovely.","265822":"Funny how endearing that dimwit can be.","265826":"Then I'm not the only one who sees something in him?","265832":"Who would go against a goddess?!","265835":"George is a man of refinement!","265838":"Show him some culture, will you?","265844":"The mother, cradling the child.","265847":"George is the second most cultured person I know.","265850":"A boorish pair of hangers-on.","265856":"How dare you assail the noble Bente!","265858":"About time someone crunched that locust!","265860":"You know, that filthy sewer rat has a mean bite.","265868":"You too would like her favour, eh?","265870":"Two feathered twits bumping around the same coop.","265872":"Her sordid dynasty is somehow worthy of credit, isn't it?","265880":"Don't think you can have her skull…","265881":"Then the prows of your ships point east.","265882":"Yes, I can't wait for him to die.","265883":"Him?

Incredible.","265935":"A feral beast to be trussed and neutered.","265936":"We cannot allow La Corona to gain influence, can we?","265938":"Don't trouble yourself with such lowly enemies.","265947":"Raise flags with a lunatic? Unthinkable!","265948":"La Corona is a rival to my poor dear Queen.","265950":"Perhaps you can help the silly pariah.","265979":"George supported me, so I support him!","265984":"Make him suffer as he made my people suffer.","265991":"George is an ally you can rely on.","265996":"If you support Silva, you support La Corona.","266021":"A war with Auntie Maggs?

I'll stay close to you just in case you need support.\"","266038":"We are in the middle of the sea right now. We need to stand on firm ground.","266039":"\"A very decent island we have! But start roll up your sleeves. Our employees won't work without a decent housing.\"","266040":"That's a good start. We can grow even further, if we provide our employees with basic needs and better housing!","266041":"Our industry is running, but the revolt starts to brew and the complaints are lining up. Security and education are our priorities now.","266111":"We are failing!","266112":"Change is very slow!","266113":"We are trying our hardest!","266114":"It's a real struggle.","266115":"We are empty-handed!","266116":"Nowhere near our goal.","266117":"We have fallen far behind.","266140":"Those houses are really too rustic... Would you mind making some renovation works?","266146":"Is not my fault, eh!","266147":"Not enough, ya sé.","266148":"One of the worst years I can remember.","266149":"Something's gone wrong!","266150":"Believe me, we're trying.","266156":"I can't blame the machines!","266157":"Calculations are severely amiss!","266158":"What is the reason for this failure?!","266159":"We must revisit the manual at once!","266160":"Operation should have been simple!","266161":"I am a failure!","266162":"May as well finish me.","266163":"Nothingness.","266164":"I'm a useless donkey.","266165":"I've always been a dunce!","266166":"This production is cat-lap!","266167":"It's a right old bag o' nails.","266168":"If nothing works, might as well have stayed at home.","266169":"I won't be the scapegoat for this.","266170":"There's a whoppin' spanner in the works.","266171":"Fields fallow and barren.","266172":"I blame the soil.","266173":"A bad 'arvest","266174":"We're scrapin' the bottom of the barrel.","266175":"It's a snail's pace.","266176":"Some sort o' blight on us!","266177":"Land must be cursed!","266178":"If this place were a racehorse, you'd shoot it.","266179":"All I produce is tears.","266180":"This place is a void!","266181":"We would be better off with cave tools!","266182":"It does not yet function well.","266183":"The earth has given up on us.","266184":"It's looking pretty slim.","266189":"The board have faith in you to pull through, here's something to keep the fires burning.","266190":"Artisans are day dreamers, but their thirst for adventures could become very lucrative!","266191":"This whole new land has plentiful of products to offer. Our artisans will soon acquire the taste and skills of high society!","266192":"Our employees mastered the craft of electricity at the university. Modernity is at our door now.","266193":"We're finally here. Our engineers can craft the most luxurious products. We would become very prosperous.","266194":"I've never seen so much luxury ever before. We could start a big project where our investors would know how to spend their money?","266195":"Our monument is glorious. Imagine how many people would come to visit a great exhibition, and what marvels we could discover!","266196":"We're at the top of the world now. Well done!","266197":"A commission for the Royal fleet! And in such quantity! A rare honour indeed!","266198":"I find myself looking up to you, as the youngest often will.","266199":"So you build ships like your father? Well, the Queen is in the direst need of ships.","266200":"Supporting her will go some way to healing the wounds of the past.","266201":"These reinforcements will please Her Majesty! Though it remains my hope no war will be necessary.","266202":"The weaponry they ask for presents a problem. I'm not even sure we have an iron lode, do we?","266203":"Still have a few sticks of dynamite! We can blow our way through!","266204":"Ah, he’s here! Try to make a good first impression, eldest; any friend of father is a friend of ours.","266205":"Father used Mr. Ticker on account of his good sense. Go on, I suggest you find him in Bright Sands.","266206":"What are you both doing! Demolition is a serious matter wanting proper expertise!","266207":"I see the iron is beyond our reach. We have no choice but to find a way through the mountain.","266208":"Mr. Ticker has opened my eyes to the world of controlled destruction!","266209":"Perhaps not refined enough for your sister, but at least your workers can start their dig.","266210":"There was a chance while yer father still lived, no use dragging it out now he's gone…","266211":"Bright Sands will never be matched, if that's what you're set on.","266212":"You are trying at least. I know Samuel wouldn't have given up.","266213":"I'm starting to wonder if you can't turn things around.","266214":"You can't bring back your father, but his spirit…","266215":"I knew all along Father could never have taken his own life. But that someone willfully took his...!","266216":"The foul scent of a killer. We cannot let him escape.","266217":"Someone supplies the murderer from Madame Kahina's harbour? We should investigate.","266218":"I don't know what you're trying to achieve here, but it won't bring Samuel back.","266219":"Mining for you, mining for Eli , what's the difference?","266220":"Your father had that same steely look.","266221":"It's no Bright Sands, but it really is something!","266222":"Your company is flourishing. You may even be the match of your father, rest his soul.","266223":"Samuel Goode’s engineer? Aye, that’s me. Who’s asking?","266224":"Iron into Steel, Steel into Arms and we shall have fulfilled our first Royal commission!","266225":"There is no shame in producing weapons if it is in defence of the realm, eldest.","266226":"So I'm a commodity now, to be bought and sold? Your father treated me like a human being.","266227":"He is ready for transportation.","266228":"The locals say that trading ship over there belongs to a stranger. Maybe that's the supplier!","266229":"I can't think why he'd be worth anything. Everyone here is beyond redemption…","266230":"I'm not going to tell you your father wasn't a traitor.","266231":"I'd do anything to dodge Mr. Bleakworth's treadmill, but no, I'm not your expert.","266232":"Forget escape - and to what, Edvard's new vision for Bright Sands?","266233":"Brought here along with Samuel, none of us knowing why.","266234":"The way Mr. Bleakworth treats us, I don't blame your father for bowing out with his dignity.","266235":"Traitor or not, Samuel wouldn't have wanted his people to suffer for it.","266236":"Demolition? I could demolish a proper breakfast.","266237":"I was made to scrub Mr. Bleakworth's scabby back once.","266238":"Mr. Bleakworth conducts every lashing himself.","266240":"He freely admits to his crime! Get him!","266241":"No, he is dead! It cannot end here, we have no answers!","266242":"It is father's diary! Quickly, what does he say!?","266243":"Of course, the island over which he was accused of treason! That is what they are after.","266246":"The diary may not be enough in itself to convince Sir Archibald, but it may give him food for thought.","266247":"No doubt father thought this symbol germane. If anyone can interpret it, Madame Kahina can.","266248":"There must be some clue among the wreckage, anything!","266249":"It's empty!","266250":"Endless cloaks and masks!","266251":"Maggot-ridden!","266252":"An assortment to make the blood curdle!","266253":"The mark of the Pyrphorians. This sign of fire is reserved for those they wish death upon.","266254":"I never knew your father was mixed up with the Pyrophorians—a grave malevolence.","266255":"You may be wild, child, but don’t go to the new world, don’t rouse the dragon from its slumber.","266256":"I had believed it would only do harm to tell you, but I have grounds to believe your father was murdered.","266257":"And the killer, his cellmate, walks free! The rumour is he's in hiding, preparing to flee to the New World.","266258":"It is believed his accomplice supplies him with goods from the Emporium Exotique!","266259":"Who do we have here?! Samuel Goode's child. Want to go down with your father, do you?","266260":"Sarmento's last location is all we have. We need to plan our expedition route carefully.","266261":"This symbol is a death threat?! But Her Majesty received one identical! Upon a plain envelope, with a stamp from the colonies!","266262":"We still don't know how your father was involved in all this, but I fear the answer lies west.","266263":"Your father sold Prosperity to the leader of the rebels Isabel Sarmento.","266264":"Ever since the deal, Isabel has been hiding from us. But you may be the one to find her.","266265":"You're too late. I was just a spark, and the touch-paper is already lit...","266271":"The horsemen are coming!","266272":"You're going to need your Sunday clothes!","266274":"I'm in a daze…","266275":"Mamá, I am hungry…","266276":"Ah the old days…","266277":"Impossible!","266278":"Is the sun getting hotter!?","266279":"El infierno…","266280":"This is more hole than it is shoe.","266281":"It's better in the shade…","266282":"Señor, señor! A letter.","266283":"Ugh, I thought it was just mud…","266284":"I'd like something cold…","266285":"¿Qué tal está usted?","266286":"We could use some rain.","266287":"Was I asleep that long?","266288":"Padre, can we go a la playa?","266290":"The world feels alive today.","266292":"It's so good to be en casa!","266293":"Canta y no llores, sing, don't you cry!","266294":"I wish mi mamá could see this.","266295":"Qué maravilla…","266296":"¡Vivan los novios!","266297":"Here, have a good drink, paca.","266302":"Spare a coin, amigo?","266303":"Your baby is so lindo!","266304":"A chick who abandons her nest!","266305":"¡Ole!","266306":"Smiles light up her chubby face!","266307":"The sea view never fails to calm me.","266308":"¡Es el paraíso…!","266309":"I hear the ocean singing…","266310":"Living like an old-world queen!","266311":"¡Bienvenidos! Makes yourselves at home!","266312":"There's the good, the bad, and the ugly…","266313":"We're in transition – you have to understand.","266314":"Niños, don't run around!","266315":"Is your tío feeling better?","266316":"Of course, you can eat some of mine.","266317":"Godspeed, mi buen señor.","266318":"Well, fool's gold is better than no gold!","266319":"The flag is full of holes you can poke your hand through.","266320":"This time, we leave at first light!","266321":"Madre, why can't we go outside?","266322":"The dream is dying.","266323":"Nobody cleans these streets?","266324":"Remember La Corona? It's almost that bad.","266325":"The past casts long shadows...","266326":"Is it… safe to be quite this close?","266327":"I admit it's charming when they nuzzle.","266328":"What can be the purpose of those markings?","266329":"Wildly exciting, but I'm starting to feel peckish.","266330":"Doesn't it look a bit emaciated to you?","266331":"I'm fortunate enough to have seen these in the wild.","266332":"Surely, if they can jump that high, they…","266333":"I expected them to be larger in the flesh.","266334":"Come on, children, it's time to go.","266335":"We could bypass these…?","266336":"It says not to touch! Gracious...","266337":"Is there a label to indicate what it is?","266338":"I feel my faculties mildly advance.","266339":"I feel a certain kinship with our forefathers...","266340":"Curious, certainly.","266341":"Could look nice in our drawing room.","266342":"They say she sold seashells by the sea shore.","266343":"Aha…! How distinctive...","266344":"Oh, is there more?","266345":"Perfect for a rainy afternoon.","266346":"And they say piracy's dying!","266347":"I'd go off the edge of the world for her.","266348":"Arrgh!","266349":"Drink up lad.","266350":"Show me that map…","266351":"Aye, scimitar's a good blade.","266352":"Live as if tomorrow will be your last!","266353":"...then she hit him so hard, he spat out his teeth.","266354":"…the jellyfish took the Queen's pardon.","266355":"We can recruit more souls down south.","266356":"Aye, a yellowed stump's all that's left of it…","266357":"Hey! I've got the curlier beard!","266358":"D'you remember doubloons?","266359":"She's no silk stocking. That world is dead to Annie now.","266360":"Stop hogging the rum, or Annie'll hear of it!","266361":"Whenever I see fire, I'm afraid.","266362":"We believe in Isabel.","266363":"An idea cannot be destroyed.","266364":"¡Esta tierra es nuestra!","266365":"Even if we are on the run…","266366":"Ever feel you're being watched?","266367":"Couldn't sleep, too sticky.","266368":"More bullets? Let's hope we don't need them.","266369":"Always be ready, eh? Good girl.","266370":"Don't question Isabel, bobo!","266371":"She is a beacon radiating hope.","266372":"My cousin still rots in a La Corona jail…","266373":"Never know who's behind those masks.","266374":"Isabel will guide us to liberation!","266375":"It's our principles that set us apart, sister.","266376":"Isabel will never surrender.","266377":"It's better to know if something is wrong.","266378":"You never know if, or when they'll come for you.","266379":"Not all cults are creepy, but the Pyrphorians...!","266380":"Sometimes I see torches on the move at night.","266382":"Dynamite fishing?! You're serious? Well, the village north is always short on food.","266383":"Remember when we escaped the pits back in the day? Still some dynamite left.","266384":"I hid it next to the abandoned lighthouse. Go fetch it!","266385":"Here it is! Just get plenty of distance on the throw.","266386":"The dynamite is at the lighthouse, old pal.","266387":"They're not expecting Queen Parrotfish; anything with fins will do.","266388":"All the blistered fish they could ever want.","266389":"A long sea journey won't make me give up my vow to stick by you.","266390":"I owe my life to you. You go, I follow, until I decide the debt is paid.","266391":"You never told me you had a sister, what else haven't you told me about?","266392":"Sometimes you have to face the past to have a future.","266393":"A bird with a spear would be faster.","266394":"You’re just destroying coral, you clown.","266395":"You couldn’t hit an cow’s arse with a sitar.","266396":"Even more roasted fish!","266397":"Still trying to get used to that smell of char.","266398":"You do have an eye for opportunity. After all, it’s not TNT the locals are short of.","266399":"Are we leaving on a packet ship, or has the wind blown through your ears again?","266400":"If it's you lighting the fuse, I'm going to keep well back.","266401":"Must be plenty of fish in this bay.","266402":"Don't look at me—dynamite was your idea.","266404":"With that first bang I knew it was you! So come show me what you got this time!","266405":"Ah! That burnt reek! Ugh! Hand over whatever it is and I'll help you get rid of it.","266406":"Here are your tickets. Hurry, drifters! The boat is leaving soon. And nobody wants you to miss it.","266407":"Fuera! I told you drifters before, rum don’t grow on trees.","266408":"When are you layabouts going to get a job?","266409":"What the chimichurri was that boom?","266410":"So loud the church bell is ringing!","266415":"Of course there is! I told you, we’re late!","266416":"No, only in 2D! They went and splurged the entire emergency budget on sausages for the Anno Union.","266417":"Are you crazy? No! We see this through! And stop calling me Tanya, I’m Bente—stay in character!","266418":"Ladies and Gentlemen! A very warm welcome to the dress rehearsal of \"\"The Jørgensens - The Musical\"\"'","266419":"Nope. I gave the libretto some welcome revision last night.","266420":"—And what, grandpa? Get with the program. The Anno series has its best moments behind it. The Jørgensens, on the other hand, are rising stars in the strategy universe. Rumour has it Ubisoft already plans a whole new franchise, with me at the helm.","266421":"How many times? It’s Bente, not Tanya, thickie!","266422":"With the teensy difference that we lack the pink tutu.","266423":"Too much info!","266424":"Shut up!","266425":"I think we get it.","266426":"We did. when archie says her majesty he means…","266427":"You are the nine / The only one / Without whom / We would feel so small","266428":"I did not believe / Thought it was a ruse / took for blasphemy / the obvious truth.","266429":"To be honest, none, your majesty.","266430":"Who, or rather what, are you?","266431":"I’m sorry Nathaniel, but in this condition it is impossible for you to take part.","266432":"No, just no.","266433":"You’re telling me! An evening of anno takes forever. Luckily most of us fast forward.","266434":"Just fast forward!","266435":"They all fast forward!","266436":"We fast forward, and forward…","266437":"Oh what now?!","266438":"No portrait, nothing, only a colour? He is not allowed to join!","266439":"You are player blue, / But no-one really gets to know you","266440":"This is getting ridiculous.","266441":"Shut it!","266442":"Damn thing!","266443":"It’s much too soon for me to be through!","266444":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266445":"How do you both look?","266446":"Oh, that! I like to wear it in private.","266447":"Poppycock! Don’t be such a prude. How do you know I haven’t been wearing a tutu all along? You only ever see my top half in-game.","266448":"What does everyone have against mein tutu? I think it’s time you all took stock... / I hereby solemnly confess: / I wear a pink tutu / From late at night till morning dew / I wear a pink tutu / I wear a pink tutu. / Yes, thank heaven above! / Avoid me, belittle me / but oh how it flatters me / And it fits like a glove. / I wear a pink tutu. / In contempt of my character rules / When I appear, It’s true / I wear most certainly / Something beneath made of tulle / I wear a pink tutu. / So before you begin to pooh-pooh / take time to scrutinise / please try to recognise / That I wear a tutu","266449":"No I refuse to be quiet / Now everything’s out in the light / If in the loading screen, the harbour, / or in the trading menu / forever I’ll wear a tutu!","266450":"Good, then we can begin.","266451":"I did not know the queen was part of this. I thought we cut that witch out?","266452":"Oh golly-gosh, the nine!","266453":"quite feeble and small","266454":"The magic lies in the checksum","266455":"I thought we looked shit!","266456":"Nothing personal chum, but you look unspeakable.","266457":"No!","266458":"A shame he has taken it so badly. He thinks anno is so boring—he was really looking forward to the musical.","266459":"He simply clicks fast forward!","266460":"Then he fasts forward!","266461":"They all fast forward!","266462":"We fast forward, and forward…","266463":"No, wait. something’s wrong. The lighting should be  different somehow. The sun should be…","266464":"Where’s the ambulance?","266465":"No name to set things straight / The concept is rather hard to relate","266466":"Anyone have a light?","266467":"No! mein tutu! / Oh horror! Oh pain! / All we see is made of paper!","266468":"All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?","266469":"All of it burns, my pink tutu!","266470":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266471":"ME! You said it worm, kneel before the one true god of anno!","266472":"/ 1800 / 1602 / In every game / I shelter you / 1701 / 1404 / Each anno game / Is just the same","266473":"Enough of your grovelling! Rise Mortals! / Now, which role do you see for me in your little drama?","266474":"Your attempts at flattery are futile. I am going to pwn a game of 1404 now. When I get back this will be “checksum 9: the musical” or you will feel my holy wrath.","266475":"The moral of the story is simple. Without me, it doesn’t work. See you in Anno 1305!","266476":"There you are. I thought you may have begun without me.","266477":"But… I’m Old Nate! don’t you recognise me?","266478":"Don’t do this to me! You know how I love musicals.","266479":"I know, / a lowly intern painted me / And he was badly paid / I know / I have no proper face / And now I look like a disgrace / I know / A lowly intern cobbled me / The team just stood and laughed. / I know / for colour there’s no money in the purse / And the midday sun / ensures I look ten times worse","266480":"Please say, that i am “in”. / My heart it breaks in twain. / And If, I cannot sing, woe! / What will I do then, oh? / Come now, shake my hand!","266481":"Yeah / I saw the whole thing coming / Now it’s time for me to go. / Dear mother she was a sketching book / And even she loathes how I look","266482":"Oh… there’s already someone out there!","266483":"How do you look? I’d presumed we would be fully rendered here…","266484":"Darnation! I always said this union business was a nonsense! And that we are to look shabby-chic because of it?! Whatever next, my dear Tanya? Shall we abandon it all?","266485":"Not \"Anno 1800 - The Musical\", then?!'","266486":"Er...I’m not sure if her Majesty would approve. Perhaps over tea at the palace we could discuss your designs and—","266487":"Oh dear Tanya, please can we stick to…","266488":"Equally as flat as you are.","266489":"But we are not in private! You are here in the role of Anno-A.I! Carl Leonard von Malching—ill-tempered industrialist!","266490":"One moment, her majesty has not arrived yet.","266491":"quite feeble and small","266492":"The magic lies in the checksum","266493":"We could never have dared hope you would participate in so irreverent a trifle.","266494":"To be honest, no…","266495":"No!","266496":"But the game is jolly boring. Half the time I’m asleep before anyone discovers my island!","266497":"When your ship has you snoring / When the waiting is boring / I click fast forward!","266498":"Is my island warehouse bare? / Is that just too hard to bear? / then I fast forward!","266499":"Simply just fast forward!","266500":"We fast forward, and forward…","266501":"I think the sun is burned-out.","266502":"You don’t recognise it? I jest not, this is how we looked in 1602.","266503":"Oh so true! It’s far too much blue!","266504":"Oh horror! Oh pain! / Who came up with this stupid play!?","266505":"All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?","266506":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266508":"Did someone call for me?","266509":"So it’s my fault again?","266510":"What should I be?! Say it! What is it this time? Should I hang lower in the sky? Should I turn with you? If I ever make it into the game without one person complaining I’ll eat my hat. Come on then you bright sparks, gift me an entry in the options menu, this wheelie-bin for half-finished features. Or even better! How about a day-night cycle, huh? Then every five minutes I can cede my throne to a rotten cheese!","266511":"Peeps, in the old days nobody needed that. The world was in 2D. Everybody was happy that they could see anything at all.","266512":"If only father were here, he'd have known what to do.","266515":"It is not nearly as moribund here as it was.","266516":"Those still loyal to Father will now turn to you.","266517":"A moving tribute to see so many loyal to father trust in you.","266518":"At such times it is good to occupy oneself with routine things.","266519":"I'm sure you know, but father was innocent.","266520":"We must behave as if father were acquitted, as one day he will be.","266521":"Aarhant is proving wise counsel. I'm glad you managed to make a friend while you were away.","266522":"In times such as these, it is good to have people around us.","266523":"I'll dream of Bright Sands until the day I can dream no more.","266524":"A cloud still hangs over this place, please make it go away!","266525":"She has you doing all those chores you tried to leave behind.","266526":"Everything depends on this enterprise for your sister, I won't watch you let her down.","266527":"You're better with humankind than I used to believe.","266528":"First the weather, now the people!","266529":"It is not rain, but wet mist! And endless! What are we doing here?!","266530":"Disrespectful chatter abounds about your father and how he died.","266531":"Sometimes feels like your sister hardly knows you.","266532":"The tin rush left this island ugly.","266533":"Funny to watch you get your hands dirty.","266534":"So serious all of a sudden. Where’s that old spirit of yours gone?","266535":"You'll not have a dribble of inheritance after all your frivolity out in god-knows-where.","266536":"Prosperity's sale is a disaster for the Empire, the Queen has said as much to me herself!","266537":"Prosperity, sold to New World rebels, can you imagine?!","266538":"Did you expected a fatted calf to be slaughtered on your return?","266539":"You must now see, no-one wants you here.","266541":"I feel as crushed and obsolete as yesterday's front page.","266542":"Nothing I say has any influence on Edvard, I am his doormat.","266543":"They're at the gates!","266545":"Take cover!","266546":"Over there, in the undergrowth!","266547":"It's everywhere, there's no way through!","266549":"A tragedy! And why are we its chorus!?","266550":"We've nowhere to run!!","266551":"This way, hurry!","266552":"Our betrayers are everywhere!","266553":"Perhaps Sir John's maps were inaccurate?","266554":"What were they thinking? Sailing further in...","266555":"I shall never have had enough of this Inuit jerky!","266556":"Who's there!? ... Mind's playing tricks on me...","266557":"If it weren't for the Inuit...","266558":"The huskies seem full of gusto, at least!","266559":"The Inuit can look beyond the ice.","266560":"The arctic council are cowards...","266561":"Hurry, she's buried in the snow!","266562":"I just hope the bears stay away...","266563":"Never imagined I would fatigue of daylight.","266564":"...rope and as many axes as you can lay hands on.","266565":"If we'd gotten there just one minute later...","266566":"Wouldn't trust the artic council with my blisters...","266567":"We must prepare for everything and anything.","266568":"I only hope we find them alive...","266569":"About time we saw some chaos!","266570":"The denizens of night have returned to their crack in the wall, for now.","266571":"Don't let those Pyrphorians near my vases!","266572":"A trial? How unspeakably sordid!","266573":"Fight the Pyrphorians with love! They will beg you to stop!","266574":"I feel sorry for the Pyrphorians. What drives people to be like that?","266575":"My urchins have known for months this was coming!","266576":"Open war wasn't their style now, was it? But you know they won't be gone forever dearie!","266577":"Bring an end to this age of terror!","266578":"Two flawed men. But there was good in them, as there is in you.","266579":"Shades pour from the earth! We will be overrun!","266580":"Two tattered flowers showered with tears give life to a meadowfull.","266583":"Edvard becomes a monster inconceivably grotesque, but one we, for now must keep fed.","266584":"As this letter proves them innocent, let us hurry to Sir Archibald.","266585":"For almost the first time since he passed, eldest, my heart is lifted.","266586":"Building a shipyard is no small matter, our work is far from finsihed.","266587":"Father would be ashamed to see his brother now.","266588":"I shall not be content with any ship, until I can say it is one we ourselves have built.","266589":"The ship is another serendipity we should be grateful for.","266590":"I could hire these Pyrphorians as mercenaries—defeat that nuisance Sarmento.","266591":"Hmmn I wonder if fire could fit in with my strategy...","266592":"You unstoppered the bottle and let the menace loose!","266593":"I was worried for a while there would be no Queen to grant me my baroncy.","266594":"The Pyrphorians! Don't come for me, I'm really low class!","266595":"You must have fed off my resilient aura there, driving the P-p-pyrphorians away.","266596":"Why does everyone want a piece of the Queen now?","266597":"I'm sure I recognised something about that grandmaster.","266598":"Blow away the shadows, for all our sakes.","266599":"Ruthless when you had to be, I like that. The world is rid of a great evil.","266600":"I beg you, I don't want to live in a world of Pyrphorians. Make them go away.","266601":"Phew! That's one less threat to our survival that I have to take care of!","266603":"A shame Edvard never had a taste of real justice.","266604":"I had been looking forward to putting Edvard's head through the noose. Never mind.","266605":"Surely there is someone to punish for all of this!?","266606":"Though the burden is lifted, Edvard will keep you headlocked for life if you allow him to.","266607":"Edvard has shown his weakness as a leader. We must exploit it.","266608":"This is our chance to show Edvard who rules the waves.","266609":"Sometimes doing the wrong thing is the right thing, old pal.","266610":"Why would we need a licence to build a boat? Seems that's how it is here...","266611":"Once this shipyard is built, we can gesture rudely at Edvard, and go back to adventuring.","266612":"She says it's ''your'' shipyard? Does that mean we're going to be here forever?","266613":"All I smell on your Uncle is greed.","266614":"Don’t grovel for your Uncle. He has no power over you.","266615":"You do know Edvard has no intention of lifting that debt?","266616":"Since that day you saved my life, I have presumed I knew you. But now...","266665":"We are broke, old pal! We can’t afford passage back to the old world, back to your family! Not unless you’ve suddenly remembered what work is.","266696":"Our father is accused of high treason. Dare you to believe it? Arrested, stripped of his knighthood. We… I am terribly shaken, and the vultures are already circling.","266715":"Will you now stand by, knowing gentle father is endungeoned? It must kill him. Please come home. We need you.","266716":"Edvard registered the debt officially?!","266717":"What? Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to abducting my workers? The Queen’s ambassador himself shall hear of this.","266719":"And if I may—excuse me—a false one. We left Edvard quite willingly.","266720":"Don’t worry, that old tyrant can’t hold us back anymore!","266721":"Now that sounds like good news.","266722":"Abduction is a severe accusation...","266723":"I see nothing criminal. A bit of interfamilial bickering is only natural, and hardly a matter for the crown.","266724":"And as for you, I have quite forgotten my manners. Sir Archibald Blake, ambassador and confidant to the Queen. Despite the circumstances, Her Majesty and I were pleased to hear of your return. Your father’s death was a tragedy; we regret he never had the chance of a fair trial.","266725":"Sadly your Uncle has indeed alerted me to some floating liabilities. I fear you have no choice but to settle them if I am to grant you your crown shipping licence.","266726":"Indeed! Once my letterpress is up and running, the truth will come back to haunt Edvard! For your hospitality, please, use my ship howsoever you may wish!","266727":"Pencil-polishing popinjay! I should have been rid of you long ago!","266728":"The real tragedy here is the vast funeral bill that goes unpaid, while this brat is living the life of O'Reilly!","266729":"Boom!","266731":"A shame you can't appreciate the craft this requires. Never mind, the charges have been primed, the perimeter cleared, we are ready to detonate.","266732":"Who are all these busybodies? Blowing up rocks can't be that complicated!","266733":"Ha! My apologies, that was indeed impressive! Is there anything dynamite won't solve, I wonder?","266735":"So, you found us. Take a look around. What can the henchmen of the Empire do to us that the Pyrphorians haven't already?","266736":"Please, Miss Sarmento, we come here only to prove our father innocent—Samuel Goode.","266737":"Goode? The man that sold Her Majesty's precious island to me? He is just as guilty as I am!","266738":"So you are calling me a liar? Love is blind. Back before they left their fiery mark, the Pyrphorians told me your father would come— to sell me Prosperity.","266739":"I knew conspiring against the Empire was a bad idea. Afterwards, when I refused to work with the Pyrphorians, they came to teach us a lesson.","266740":"Now our movement drills their oil for nothing, night and day. We have lost the strength to fight.","266741":"Still we are afraid. And even though we buried the dead and found a hideaway, I cannot provide shelter for all of them.","266742":"So you won't let go? Then let's get to business. Help me shelter and protect the good people that are part of this movement. If I see you can be trusted, I will find you the contract that sealed the deal on Prosperity. Are you in?","266743":"I don't know about you, but my father would never have betrayed his Queen!","266744":"We are very sorry to hear your situation, still I must insist our father's...","266745":"How long can it take to peel a potato?","266746":"Where is my sausage!?","266747":"Are you darning the things yourself?","266748":"The longer you wait, the less inclined I shall be to write off your sizeable debt.","266749":"A few bottles of bathtub booze?","266750":"Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to theft?","266751":"I will let Edvard know that I have granted you your shipping licence.","266752":"We also hear on the grapevine, of your commendable intention to establish your own shipping company…","266753":"Her Majesty warmly invites you to trade in sovereign harbours, at your own discretion of course.","266759":"I know, it's not much of a ship, but this is no time to be picky.","266760":"Your father always saw to it that we had rights and unions and all that gubbins.","266761":"Shame what happened to your father. We'll stand by your side!","266762":"We will follow you as we followed Samuel!","266763":"Ready to leave Bright Sands behind!","266764":"If you're only half your father, you're way beyond Edvard!","266765":"Your uncle is nothing like your father! We'll follow you!","266766":"I know we look like criminals, but we were trusted associates of your father.","266767":"Granting such a prestigious commission shows the council may be willing to give us fair hearing.","266768":"The last moneys I spent on Ditchwater appear well spent, eldest—and the faith I invested in you.","266769":"This could be the start of something significant for us.","266770":"I'm sure if we have iron deposits, you can find them, eldest.","266771":"If the royal fleet is to be at the cutting edge, we must start producing steel.","266772":"Steel! How proud father would be.","266773":"You have put in as much hard work as anyone else!","266774":"To outfit our ships, we're going to need to fashion all that steel into weaponry.","266775":"Perhaps we should sell ships to partners father trusted.","266776":"I predict inexhaustible demand for our steel!","266777":"We are the beating heart of industry in the Empire.","266778":"Exactly the sort of mischief I remember you by.","266779":"Mr. Ticker has years of experience in detonations, we must secure his services.","266780":"Who would kill such a gentle man? Why?","266781":"Always dangerous, getting wrapped-up in the business of a Queen.","266795":"My bond is to you, not to your monarch.","266796":"You're part of it now, just like your father was.","266797":"Once you reach the top, there's only one way from there.","266798":"I'm still waiting for the boom!","266799":"I suppose it is better to let the experts handle it.","266800":"My sword is fashioned from Ukku steel, but to produce in these quantities!","266801":"This steel will command great value.","266802":"I never imagined a city could grow so fast.","266803":"You're a real fat cat now! Hope you remember one day how you got here…","266804":"The workers may as well start preparing for the detonation.","266805":"Admit it, you’d never have hired a demolition expert in the old days.","266806":"Fizzle, fizzle, boom! Hahaha.","266807":"The way to the iron mines is clear!","266808":"Perhaps you can help me understand who keeps a murder under their hat? Forgive me, I know we speak of your father…","266809":"I read in the papers you build ships like your father. His actions have likely led to war, so it would be strangely fitting if you were to supply the Queen's fleet.","266810":"You are doing Her Majesty a great service in these difficult times.","266811":"How are those ships coming along? Her Majesty will be pleased.","266812":"Her Majesty wants only warships. It is after all important in such times that she defends her sovereignty.","266813":"We rely more and more on captains of industry to steer us to happy futures.","266814":"You're stubborn, that's for sure. A chip off the old block.","266815":"So you're the one that fled his duties. Well you're too late, there's nothing to be done.","266816":"You realise this will be no palm-tree paradise, only hard graft?","266817":"My wife tells me I shouldn't be so hard on you.","266818":"You're brave coming back, many people blame all this on you.","266819":"Samuel always had high hopes for you. It was a great blow to him when you left.","266820":"My prison outfit remains in protest.","266821":"Edvard is the major cause of my distemper, not you.","266822":"Somehow got used to these pyjama stripes.","266823":"Dead or alive, I’ll always be Samuel’s man.","266824":"I realise I should have told you sooner.","266825":"Perhaps now you have the means to take justice into your own hands.","266826":"Ah, the prodigal child. Epitome of selfishness.","266827":"It'll take a lot to convince me you're worthy of the name Goode.","266828":"You never know what you have til it's gone, eh?","266829":"Give me a reason to forgive you.","266830":"Murdered? You are joking, surely!","266835":"There was a time when I took any opportunity that came my way, just like you.","266836":"Through all the smoke, I see a glimmer in you.","266837":"Choose your customers, don't let them choose you.","266839":"Oh do stop, Archie. Is this tiny fleet all I have to sink to get my island back?","266840":"Who are you, to speak up without permission?","266841":"So Edvard is the traitor! I certainly never authorised that silly-billy to act on my behalf. I declare the contract null and void.","266842":"Then I suppose we'll not be sinking any ships today. Not even as a deterrent?","266843":"Well in that case I hereby declare Prosperity returned to the Goode children—to compensate the dead father, thereby ensuring Miss Sarmento and co. are safe from this Pyrphorian nuisance.","266844":"I don't do favours for the children of traitors. Or does that look tell me you're willing to pay…?","266845":"I'm sure it won't be too long before Edvard contrives to have him back in prison.","266846":"I don't care why Edvard sent them here. That's his business.","266847":"Your father's death was a routine suicide. We get them all the time.","266848":"Nothing in this prison escapes my notice, if there was any funny business with your father's death I'd have known about it!","266849":"Isabel Sarmento, Her Royal Highness The Queen requires you to give up your iniquitous seizure of Prosperity, an island which, by no means...","266850":"Er… this is one of the Goode children I mentioned. A little forward, but surprisingly helpful so far!","266851":"Terribly sorry, your Majesty, but I fear not.","266853":"Then we too were betrayed. We will leave Prosperity immediately, your Majesty.","266854":"They are more than a nuisance! And they will never accept this. You must be careful!","266860":"You look into this, eldest. I'm not sure I can face it.","266874":"This is what we wanted after all. To know the truth.","266875":"What could he have meant, eldest? I fear this mystery is only just begun.","266876":"I now have more questions than answers.","266877":"Father's killer was a nobody. Something greater conspires against our family.","266878":"Oh we are swept up in something now, eldest. And I am coming with you…","266879":"I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering such mysteries.","266880":"I wonder if Sir Archibald knows of this Pyrphorian threat? I think we have enough here to beg his consideration again…","266882":"Where is the contract that would be official proof of Prosperity's sale?","266883":"Be careful, eldest.","266884":"It relates the sale of the island Prosperity—the very reason father was branded a traitor.","266885":"We cannot let the truth sink into the murk!","266886":"Father’s own hand! Now we shall know his mind, eldest.","266887":"Don’t be afraid to ask Madame Kahina, she became a good friend to father.","266888":"Kahina is acquainted with the new world, she is sure to have seen this symbol before.","266889":"All we have is Isabel’s last-known hideaway, and a world of unknowns in between.","266890":"Prosperity is the cause of all this trouble. I already despise that wretched place.","266891":"I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering mysteries.","266892":"If you are going to do this, I am coming with you.","266893":"At last the expedition has found Miss Sarmento. Let us hope she makes our journey worthwhile.","266894":"Maybe nothing need be sunk at all, majesty!","266895":"Regard here, your Majesty! The Prosperity contract and our father's diary. The signatures do not match!","266896":"And now compare with a freight document by our uncle Edvard. Do you see? He forged the signature in order to impersonate father!","266898":"We hear you Isabel, but first we return to Bright Sands and confront uncle Edvard. His wicked masquerade is over!","266899":"A tiger must stay low and close to his prey.","266914":"Still your rage. The trail may not end here.","266915":"There, that must be the villain's ship!","266916":"Keep a good distance, but don't let the wretch slip away.","266917":"Your father's testament is clear! No guilty man would write with such confidence!","266918":"He has nowhere to go.","266919":"There is the ship. Let's keep our distance, see where it goes.","266920":"His words are a warning. Whoever our nemesis is, they are many steps ahead.","266921":"He is dead?","266922":"Gather your things Edvard. For your trial.","266923":"No!","266924":"Samuel will forgive you on the other side, Edvard!","266926":"After the excellent work you are doing for the fleet, I think you're entitled to pursue the odd personal matter.","266931":"I wish as much as you that your father were innocent in this.","266932":"Those very serious accusations against your father are hard to dismiss without proof to the contrary.","266933":"The sale of Prosperity, made in Samuel's name, has weakened Her Majesty's position greatly.","266934":"You digging around in state matters isn’t ideal, but in this case may be necessary.","266935":"That these ''Pyrphorians'' may have spread their influence in the New World is grave news indeed.","266936":"The situation closer to home is already difficult. Her Majesty has come under increasing scrutiny from many sides.","266937":"Her Majesty may go to war with Isabel. That is why she is mustering a fleet.","266938":"Isabel will be cagey, but I think she with time may listen to us.","266939":"Isabel may not trust you to begin with. But remember, neither did I!","266940":"You may find Isabel fiercely independent. But I trust in you to bring her round.","266941":"I fear Her Majesty will not care to know the difference between these Pyrphorians and the local rebellion. So we'll have to leave that to you.","266942":"I wish you the best, for Queen and country!","266943":"No, child. It's too late. Judgement has already come.","266944":"I am.","266945":"No please, don't be afraid. It's time to let go. My ship has sailed...","266946":"Look! Devils from below breathing fire and flame!","266947":"We are not afraid of cowards hiding behind masks.","266948":"Their fleet is formidable. I count many ships.","266949":"Yes, Grandmaster! Gladly.","266950":"Edvard Goode. Are you ready to be reunited with your brother?","266951":"Of course you are. The heat will peel your sins from your flesh like cloth. Acolytes, purge the place!","266952":"Pathetic! But then, surely Samuel awaits you too! The whole Goode family can be reunited in the everlasting. We squeezed the life from your father's lungs, peeled your uncle's skin...You must be curious as to what we plan for you!","266953":"A new world order is at stake— the Empire already shaking to its foundations, and the Goode family helpless to prevent it! We first eradicate the offspring and then eradicate the Queen!","266954":"No surprise to hear criminals are drawn here, they go where the money goes.","266957":"A lot of strange people like to meet in my harbour. That's the nature of the business.","266958":"Too many shadows to know where one starts and another begins.","266959":"Don't be stubborn like your father. Stay away from the new world, Prosperity—it is the source of all your troubles.","266960":"Your father was one of the few honest traders.","266961":"Your father was a dear friend to me. To think the killer hid himself in my harbour…","266962":"Smoke rises on the horizon. A threat emerges.","266963":"Your father was singled out. The Queen's most trusted. I know how these schemes work.","266964":"The Pyrphorians keep themselves very secret. They may be watching your every step!","266965":"The Pyrphorians are an arcane sect. Invisible, yet everywhere.","266966":"What is that tinseled marionette talking about, Archie? We are safe here, aren't we?","266971":"As safe as the situation allows, highness.","266972":"Oh you are awfully right, old chum. I beseech you, we must protect Her Majesty at any cost!","266980":"They will come for you, for everybody!","266981":"Killing your father was easy…","266982":"Want to go down with your father, do you!","266983":"The wildfire catches… it catches!","266984":"The sixth age of man approaches!","266985":"We are the firebringers!","266986":"We mortals shall take back the earth!","266987":"Look at all those subjects! How enthusiastic they seem! Do you think they celebrate me, their royal highness?","266988":"And you are absolutely sure this Samuel Goode was innocent?","266989":"Let's heal it then, and be off.","266990":"My sincerest condolences, children of Samuel. For the loss of the father you loved, and for the tragedy caused by the unfortunate actions of your uncle.","266991":"For your unquestionable loyalty and bravery you shall be knighted, and bequeathed the island of Bright Sands from now and forevermore!","266992":"Hahaha... Forgive me, I always laugh at funerals!","266993":"In a manner of speaking, your Majesty, in a manner of speaking!","266994":"No doubt, your Majesty—mustn't worry. Your attendance at this ceremony is nothing short of sublime. A gesture of the uttermost nobility that can heal this tormented place.","266995":"I fear Majesty, it is time we were on our way...","266996":"See! Her Majesty is paying her last respects, just as Archie promised!","266997":"From now on they rest side by side in the family vault.","266998":"She is...","266999":"Bright Sands is returned to us, father's name is cleared. So, that will be all, eldest. Will you and Aarhant be leaving?","267000":"I'll do anything to know the truth, even if it mean dealing with Isabel's rogues.","267005":"I will not be fooled, Aarhant. I know that we shall one day be parted. But if my prayers be answered, today will not be that day— dearest sibling? Today is not a day for parting.","267006":"Yes, just look at her. I bet she already forgot who we are.","267007":"They are at peace now.","267008":"...the Queen. She's the Queen.","267009":"After all we've been through?","267010":"As it stands, they are an easy target for the Pyrphorians. We should help, eldest.","267011":"You have done more to protect her people than Isabel could possibly have hoped, eldest.","267012":"From what we know of the Pyrphorians, I don't think it's enough yet to deter them.","267013":"Prosperity—I want to see the island that caused all this with my own eyes.","267014":"Then the Pyrphorians wanted Prosperity for the oil. No doubt to keep their fires burning.","267015":"I think we can ask anything of Isabel with her people sheltered, defended and now supplied.","267016":"This is about as much as she can ask for.","267017":"Isabel is showing genuine gratitude. Perhaps she isn't the sort I thought.","267018":"For the first time in my life, I know freedom.","267019":"Isabel claims to know the whereabouts of the contract, and it is the only trail we have.","267020":"I am so glad we are finally seeing the world together, eldest.","267021":"There it is— Prosperity. The source of all our troubles.","267022":"These fires cannot be due to the warm climate.","267023":"The firemen confirm it was arson! These fires were set upon us!","267024":"This monstrous fire-raising is deliberate. The Pyrphorians!","267025":"Isabel is mistaken. I won't hear these lies about father.","267026":"Why has Isabel not yet given us the Prosperity contract? She is worryingly elusive on the subject.","267027":"Isabel plays on our emotions. Still, if the sick could be carried to La Isla to convalesce…","267028":"A messenger boy has brought us a letter.","267029":"It is in Isabel's interest we find that contract! The Queen will realise Sarmento was forced into the deal.","267030":"What do you do here at the family crypt, Edvard? Do you vaunt your betrayal?","267031":"Enough! It was you who sold Prosperity for the Pyrphorians! You forged father's signature! You sentenced him to death! But now the sentence is on you, uncle!","267032":"And your guilt shall long outlive you, uncle. Look what you've done to our family.","267035":"What are you talking about, child? Only words between brothers, that's all.","267036":"From the moment I saw you, I knew it meant trouble.","267037":"I knew this would happen. I was just saying to your father, I'll never come up to him—not even having sacrificed it all.","267038":"He never understood the pain, of my life in his shadow.","267039":"I can't be scared. No more than I am already.","267040":"The Pyrphorians are pure evil. I thought I had control of this frightful arrangement, but when they murdered Samuel, I realised a day would come that they came for me too. The day they purge this decaying Empire with fire and flame.","267041":"Lo and behold, Her Majesty! Finally, I become worthy of her notice.","267042":"Yes. Guilty as charged.","267070":"Build us a haven on La Isla, and we can talk about getting you that contract.","267075":"We will help you. But first you have to help us.","267076":"The Pyrphorians would only exploit us if we tried to resettle ourselves. But with an island under your flag…","267077":"This place is more than good enough for us. We are used to living on very little.","267078":"They are mostly just civilians, hoping for somewhere they can feel safe.","267079":"This can be our fortress. A beautiful garden away from terrible things. We must protect it.","267080":"Once this is over I promise to repay you. Right now, I care about my people's safety!","267081":"We must be ready for the Pyrphorians if they come.","267082":"You could make the resistance yet! We are grateful to have such security now.","267083":"You're doing amazing work. Together we will fight them with everything we have!","267084":"Now you can focus on La Isla. Securing the future of men, women, and children!","267085":"Prosperity has been nothing but trouble for us. Go see for yourself.","267086":"My followers on that island are living in fear!","267087":"The persecuted, the diaspora, flock to La Isla. We must shelter them.","267088":"We need to be able to hold out should the Pyrphorians strike. Anything you can provide will help.","267089":"I feel bad for asking. But these people come here pockets empty.","267090":"This place, La Isla, can be a fortress of salvation to these people.","267091":"I didn't know if I could trust you. But you have given these people hope, and a future.","267092":"We must get the people what they need, before the Pyrphorians can break our supply lines.","267093":"Your father was guilty. I was with him when he signed the contract.","267094":"I wouldn't be surprised if the Pyrphorians pressured your father too.","267095":"The Pyrphorians took Prosperity from us the moment that deal was signed.","267096":"Helping you is too risky right now. My people need shelter from the Pyrphorian menace.","267097":"We had no choice. The Pyrphorians coerced us into buying Prosperity from your father.","267098":"Prosperity is so rich in natural resources. No wonder it is the source of all this conflict.","267099":"We want to forge something new, break away from the old.","267100":"I trust your Empire no more than the Pyrphorians. We are just pawns in their game.","267101":"Break free of La Corona, only to land in the lap of these Pyrphorian devils.","267102":"They will torch the whole city, if you try to meddle. I suggest setting up routine patrols!","267103":"Then the fires begin. It is their warning. You must find these masks who walk with the devil!","267104":"The scars the fire leaves behind do not heal fast.","267105":"We need a dedicated team to police the arsonists.","267106":"I don't think your sister likes me. But I have to keep fighting for what I believe in.","267107":"With your patrols, we can catch the arsonists in the act.","267108":"Catch the Pyrphorian arsonists!","267109":"It is these arsonists’ turn to be afraid!","267110":"The Pyrphorians work the weak to collapse. La Isla is their only hope of recovery.","267111":"Have sympathy for the many who are sick. Exhausted from the mines and the oil pumps.","267112":"There are many who struggle even to walk, cruelly made to work.","267113":"This is becoming a crisis. I worry the sick will die if we do not give them beds and clean linen.","267114":"Their homes were taken from them. Help them dream again.","267115":"First La Corona, now the Pyrphorians. If we come through this with our lives, we'll be lucky.","267116":"Take the sick and the weak from Prosperity to La Isla. Save them from a life of exploitation.","267117":"I cannot watch my people struggling under the Pyrphorian yoke.","267118":"We cannot rely on the old guard, they have given so much of their lives already.","267119":"This shall be the moment our movement truly begins! New ideas, new energy!","267120":"The young ones dream of something better. Better homes and a better life.","267121":"Without somewhere to call home, it is over for them.","267122":"These refugees, they have nowhere else to go.","267123":"You have to learn to make what friends you can out here.","267124":"I hate knowing the Empire or La Corona could just come here and crush us.","267125":"I'm sure your Queen wants to go charging in like a bull in a china shop. But good people still live on Prosperity.","267126":"I don't plan to leave anyone behind.","267127":"Keep the people moving. Now is not the time to stop and think.","267128":"All of us sticking together. That is the best chance we have of defending ourselves.","267129":"Even a modest fleet would give us independence.","267130":"It is not on land, but on water where we are vulnerable.","267131":"Wow this ship is so beautiful!","267132":"We shall name her after my brother, and pin a lock of his hair to the mast.","267133":"Pyrphorian ships approach. I have never dealt with them face-to-face. What can they want?","267134":"It is started—there's no going back. The Pyrphorians never give up.","267135":"Everything we produce here, the Pyrphorians take.","267136":"After the Pyrphorians come for the tithe, there is nothing left for us.","267137":"The cat is out of the bag. Now they know you are involved.","267138":"The Pyrphorian attack frightens them. Please, there must be room!","267139":"My island too must be evacuated, it is no longer safe there.","267140":"Many of my best were kidnapped. We have no hope of surviving without them.","267141":"What if these people grow sick? They're going to need a hospital!","267142":"Liar! You are the picture of regret!","267143":"You don't understand pain. Real pain.","267144":"But another tiresome prophet of doom, Archie. How dreary!","267145":"Well, momentarily, at least! Mr. Edvard Goode, you are to be placed under house arrest in Bright Sands until the time of your trial.","267147":"After the picket protests, many fine men left Bright Sands to join you.","267148":"Then Edvard struck back! He imprisoned all who were close to your father, including my beloved Thomas.","267149":"My husband and the others were deported to Wormways Prison and I've heard nothing from him ever since. If you do find him unharmed, prithee tell him his wife yearns for his return.","267150":"We're nearing the place your father died. Whatever happens, stay calm!","267151":"We didn't come here to be insulted, we came to strike a bargain. The demolitions man Thomas, we want him.","267152":"So there you are, the traitor's children!","267153":"Oh spare me the nauseating drivel! Flogging Queenie's peachy island in the New World to some rebel upstarts?! Traitor is too generous a word!","267154":"He hung himself in one of my cells. I'd call that a rather conclusive admission of guilt.","267155":"Oh I vaguely remember him. Stubborn, with a loose mouth, just as innocent as all the others.","267156":"He is small fry, a bail has been set.","267157":"Pay every penny of his money and I will place him immediately at your disposal.","267158":"How dare you...","267159":"Father would never have! He was the Queen's stalwart, a member of the Royal Council, he...","267178":"Burn. Burn!","267183":"When a limb is severed, a new one grows.","267184":"This kingdom shall fall with the dawn's first rays!","267185":"Drones build the nest. The Queen shall come.","267186":"It takes just a spark!","267187":"We are many.","267188":"The head of the Empire must come off.","267189":"Primal fire burns eternal!","267190":"You have no influence here!","267191":"Interfere with our thralls at your peril!","267192":"You are in dangerous waters!","267193":"These penitents work for us!","267194":"We only kept them alive to do our bidding.","267195":"The thralls will serve our master.","267196":"Isabel and her allies have trangressed for the last time! Die well!","267197":"Now we must inflict what we might have saved for later.","267198":"Isabel has forgotten what we do to those who disobey.","267199":"Fire prolongs the agony of death!","267200":"I reach out to all ship's captains, adventurers, luminaries, and merchant traders the length and breadth of the Empire! Heed my call! The life of many a good sailor is on the line.","267201":"It has been three years since the Arctic Council sent its two best ships in search of the legendary north-west passage, led by my dear husband, Sir John Faithful.","267202":"We've not heard from them since. The Arctic Council are sending rescue parties north, but their fleet is too thin to cover that vast territory before the arctic winter kicks in.","267203":"Are you decent and courageous enough to join this sole woman's cause? Worry not! Your combined efforts will be generously recompensed!","267204":"You can count on that, heheh! The noble old dame belongs to one of the most prosperous families there is.","267205":"Most likely all those poor mugs indulging her husband are drowned or chewing on their own bones, but like I said, where that much lucre's rolling in, I'll never be far behind! How's about you?","267206":"I can't believe you left me to look after shop.","267211":"This is not what I was born to do.","267212":"Our bond is being seriously tested. What are all these papers?","267213":"Admit it, you've forgotten about me.","267214":"How did Hannah do this all these years? I'm beginning to feel her pain.","267215":"I've got people asking me which palette of what needs to go where!","267216":"What are you up to overseas?","267221":"I bring grave news from our ice pilots. The pack ice becomes too thick. We'd be risking our ships if we were to continue our rescue.","267222":"So with a heavy heart, I have ordered the Arctic council fleet to return southwards to our winter haven. But do not lose hope! We will gather ourselves and return next year.","267223":"Can it be, the Arctic Council retreating just as we arrive? I mean the chairman is nonetheless correct, the pack ice grows stronger every day. Still, I have no intention of giving up as they have done.","267224":"I have assembled many of the finest-known craftsmen and ship-builders at our outpost. Presently they are preparing the shipyards to house our impressive icebreakers—vessels that will help carve a way through this frozen world.","267225":"I know it is a lot to ask, but will you endure and help me to create the fleet we need?","267226":"Yeah, go on and help the old dame send even more ships to be lost in the nothingness. Looks like you finally found your captain Ahab.","267227":"Meanwhile, I will set up me own little camp nearby. Just in case you need anything, Ishmael!","267229":"When will you give up pursuing the past and look to your future as my charge?","267230":"Gallivanting off again? People will call you irresponsible!","267231":"Sir Archibald sent you, did he?","267232":"You worked so hard to defy me! Then you run away again!","267233":"Have you met with any difficulty out there?","267234":"I promise not to ask any more of you, if you were to spend more time here.","267235":"I had the strangest dream last evening. I saw my John floating above his quarterdeck. He was waving and shouting but could not make himself heard. The silence prevailed as I approached him, when a giant wolf appeared between us.","267236":"And have we gone too far also, my friend?","267237":"Then let us be swift and brave. If only I knew what awaited us upon this eternal expanse.","267238":"You know not with whom you meddle. Leave, if you value your life, else all shall burn.","267239":"You saw Amarok. He preys upon those that stray too far from the path.","267240":"I cannot say. The spirits become restless when strangers enter their realm. If we stay too long, they will never let us leave.","267241":"So you're off to the icy marrow with the old dame, brrr. Don't get lost will yer, guv? You're me best customer!","267242":"I'm no more experienced in espionage than you, eldest. But this is our one chance to uncover the truth.","267263":"All those ships transmuting into ghosts. And then... silence.","267264":"We have to make this count. That contract will reveal all.","267265":"You have it! I never knew you had the ingenuity!","267266":"It is father's signature, but in Edvard's hand! Edvard was behind this!","267267":"I believe Sir Archibald when he says Her Majesty may do something drastic.","267268":"Well done Eldest! You have served both Isabel and the Empire greatly.","267269":"If this is the only way to get to the truth, then we must follow it.","267270":"I know it's only paperwork, but the Pyrphorians cannot operate if The Empire owns Prosperity again.","267271":"Isabel was true to her word in the end. You have to admire her shrewdness.","267272":"I realise Isabel means well.","267273":"If Aarhant were here, I'm sure he'd have some good advice.","267274":"To forge father's signature! Edvard must have been possessed!","267275":"I would have been right to strike Edvard's cheek, the many times I had the inclination!","267276":"I will not rest until Edvard sees justice, even if I must escort him to the gallows myself!","267277":"As Edvard is paraded to the town square, I want to be there in the front row.","267278":"Finally all those sailors may rejoice with their loved ones. I know what you are thinking. But don't worry. I feel no bitterness.","267280":"I know the rest are alive out there, and Sir John's broad shoulders shelter them from wind and snow.","267281":"All the stories being shared about my husband give me the strength to return next summer, with an even bigger fleet. Can I count on you again then? I dare hope so, my friend! I dare hope.","267282":"Let's not beat around the bush! We found nothing but endless white, not a single soul saved.","267283":"And yet I know that my husband and his men are out there somewhere. Frozen cold, but alive! Still alive.","267284":"I will fund another rescue attempt, come back next year, better prepared, with more ships and allies with even greater determination. Will you sail beside me again then? I dare to hope, my friend. I dare to hope!","267285":"My people's future is secure. They have you to thank for this.","267353":"The contract… it is gone! The Pyrphorians must have stolen it during the attack. How did I fall for such a simple diversion!?","267354":"You are going to have to inflitrate the Pyrphorians if you want to find that contract. I'm sorry.","267355":"You beat the Pyrphorians at their own game!","267356":"If you can convince the Queen to listen, we can explain to her.","267357":"I would give you that stupid island, if only I had the contract to tear to pieces.","267358":"We cannot thank you enough for preventing this war.","267359":"With that contract, we are taking the Pyrphorians down from the inside.","267360":"Prosperity is yours, take it! We have a new home now.","267361":"Near Prosperity, the Pyrphorians would kill us on sight.","267362":"At first I thought you were a spy of the Queen. Now I know your heart is in the right place.","267363":"I can tell you where the contract is. After that it's down to you.","267364":"Stay hidden, and you will succeed.","267365":"The man I met was your Uncle? I thought he was a creep!","267366":"I am sorry you had to go through all this just to have justice.","267367":"Her Majesty will soon go to war with Isabel over Prosperity. Any other solution would be preferable.","267389":"You would be doing a great service for Queen and country.","267390":"With that document we can still reverse the original deal.","267391":"Then it was Edvard that sold Prosperity. I didn't want to believe it, but I had my suspicions.","267392":"Her Majesty is very quick on the trigger. We must some how avoid her coming to blows.","267393":"Her Majesty will soon arrive upon her charger, sword aloft.","267394":"You have averted war most delicately! Her Majesty may thank you, in time.","267395":"Good, but there's little time. Her Majesty has her campaign chart out on the table!","267396":"A whole nation is behind you, though they do not know it.","267397":"Our Empire is spread too thin to countenance another war at this time.","267398":"Now war has been averted, an alliance with Isabel might even be of mutual benefit…","267399":"With the Pyrphorian presence on Prosperity neutralised, the island can be freely returned to its rightful keeper.","267400":"The Pyrphorians will no doubt regroup elsewhere.","267401":"Isabel needn't be an enemy to us, now Prosperity is back in safe hands.","267435":"These rebels, whoever they are, will pay the penalty for challenging my sovereignty!","267449":"The time has come to take that territory back by force.","267450":"Funny, ending a war over a bit of paper!","267451":"I must admit, I am too fond of my sailors.","267452":"I understand this means the end of a rebellion on the island, very good.","267453":"So is it Isabel who is nice, or the Pyrphorians?","267454":"As long as we have Prosperity back, that business with your father can be forgotten.","267455":"So Edvard was the nasty one, and Samuel was the one with the dandruff?","267456":"Fancy forging a signature. People can be terrible, can't they?","267457":"I'm surprised that Isabel gave it back without a fight.","267458":"If you'd taken me with you, I could have helped!","267464":"I hear you ducked out of a war. Not for the first time, eh, old pal?","267465":"Now is no time for boldness, but caution.","267466":"Don't distract me, old pal. I'm getting better at accounting!","267467":"Edvard! I told you he was rotten as a fig.","267468":"Edvard is behind this? He's pathetic.","267469":"There's a space between revenge and forgiveness.","267470":"You don't know what it is you do.","267477":"That island was signed off in Samuel's name!","267478":"Do not speak to me.","267479":"Igne Natura Renovatur","267498":"In lumine tuo videbimus lumen","267499":"The earth must burn before it turns.","267500":"The wheels turn and nothing can stop them.","267501":"All must bow to the flames.","267502":"This is not over.","267503":"The fire will burn forever!","267504":"Edvard was the cause of all our grief! To see his face when he discovers we know!","267519":"We confront Edvard this instant! I have so very many words for him!","267520":"Cast iron will make it very difficult for him to sidle away!","267521":"I will indulge not one of the thousand apologies I presume he has ready.","267522":"We should do what we can to get the evidence in order. No need to engage with Edvard.","267523":"The Queen wants the trial to be an occasion. We better make sure we're ready.","267524":"The evidence at such a high-profile inquiry must be absolutely watertight.","267525":"Finally we can have our revenge on Edvard for all he has done.","267526":"Leave no stone unturned. Who knows if Edvard has kept back other nasty surprises for us.","267527":"Now we are ready for Her Majesty. All the eyes of the world will be upon us.","267528":"If the Queen wants to make a big song and dance of the trial, we better see to it.","267529":"The Queen's visit, not the trial, may be the greatest occasion of your people's lives.","267530":"I don't know what I would do without you, eldest.","267531":"Everything comes under scrutiny in the presence of royalty.","267532":"Edvard is as good as dead to me.","267533":"I will not look at him at the trial.","267534":"Concentrate on securing a verdict for Edvard!","267535":"You were out there in paradise, and I dragged you into all this. I'm sorry.","267536":"You are the one positive in all of this. No sister could have asked for more.","267537":"Is this business really nearly over, eldest? I don't feel any better for all we've dug up.","267538":"I should have seen through it. Saved father while I had the chance.","267539":"Your ill tidings come as no surprise to me. Edvard's face betrays the game is up.","267546":"I pity the man.","267547":"There will be punishment. But Edvard has suffered since the day Samuel died.","267548":"Whatever the punishment, the damage to Edvard is already done.","267549":"We must prepare for a reckoning. Edvard was never the true enemy.","267550":"It is the Pyrphorians behind all of this, we cannot neglect the threat they pose.","267551":"The trial is a distraction. The real danger we are yet to face.","267552":"It is a start. But the Pyphorians are many.","267553":"Do everything to make sure the Queen is safe, old pal.","267554":"It will be an honour to have the Queen here, but it is not without risk.","267555":"Good, but the Queen may still be vulnerable.","267556":"Stay attuned. This is the perfect time for our enemy to recover.","267557":"We have seen nothing of the Pyrphorians but their minions.","267558":"Whoever is behind the Pyrphorians will take this time to weigh their options.","267559":"We cannot let this business with Edvard divert us from the real threat.","267560":"Black clouds loom, my old friend. Be ready to raise your umbrella.","267561":"I feel uneasy, and it's not the trial.","267562":"Even if we cannot forgive Edvard, we have to learn to let it go.","267563":"I have met the jury. They are idiots!","267564":"The Queen certainly speaks her mind.","267565":"Forget me, my race is run. A true devil is loose. It must be vanquished.","267568":"My defeat can still be your victory.","267569":"I know you want a villain, but this plot goes far beyond my petty greed.","267570":"Then you have all I can give you. I pray that it will be enough.","267571":"I'm sure you wish it was I who died. Well, soon you may have your wish.","267572":"Prosperity was only the beginning. These people will destroy everything and everyone if they have to.","267573":"There is a great danger to the established order. I will give you any help I can.","267574":"My life may be forfeit, but I can still do a last bit of good.","267575":"I didn't know what I was getting into, and then it was too late.","267576":"My father never loved me all these long years, only Samuel.","267577":"I sold our family down the river, no use hiding that now.","267578":"I regret everything. I know what Hannah must think of me.","267579":"I will not play the martyr, but I am ready to sacrifice myself for you and your sister's happiness.","267580":"I have been selfish, but I am not one of them, I never was. You must believe me.","267581":"I did not know they would kill Samuel for it, I had no idea!","267582":"Of course I will be a witness. After all you've done for us.","267597":"With Prosperity off our hands, the Pyrphorians will leave us alone.","267598":"Let me help you. I know I can make a difference.","267599":"I will tell them everything I know.","267600":"I don't need to take an oath to speak the truth.","267601":"I hope as witness, I can prove the Pyrphorians were behind this deal, not us.","267602":"I was certain it was your father that day, but now I know was wrong.","267603":"Your majesty. Isabel Sarmento, at your service.","267605":"I think it's better you break the bad news to Edvard. Let him know his gambit is over.","267619":"A terrible business. Edvard must be put now to trial.","267620":"It has been decided that you shall construct a new Court of Justice for the purpose of Edvard's trial.","267621":"As saviour in the New World, Her Majesty agrees that you should host this prestigious trial.","267622":"It is fitting that a new crown court be erected upon family soil for the trial.","267623":"Just like your court of justice, the case against Edvard is beginning to gather momentum.","267624":"Her Majesty has been ever so much looking forward to seeing her new Court of Justice. I hope you'll be ready.","267625":"Her Majesty is itching to visit! Have your best curtsey ready!","267626":"I hardly dare interrupt the miraculous transformation of your island, but Her Majesty is rather keen to get on with things.","267627":"This could be a good opportunity for Isabel Sarmento to come forward as a witness.","267628":"I think we have built up enough trust with Isabel to rely on her as a witness.","267629":"Her majesty was remarkably tolerant of the idea of Sarmento as a witness.","267630":"When it comes to the Pyrphorians, there's still a lot we don't know.","267631":"The Queen has taken a great interest in this trial.","267632":"Once built, your Court of Justice shall inaugurate a new era of peace and prosperity for Empire.","267642":"This trial should be a celebration! A toast to all things civilised.","267643":"I don't normally attend trials so this one must be important.","267644":"You now own the highest court in the land!","267645":"The Court of Justice, magnificent!","267646":"Is the Court of Justice finished yet? Not quite?","267647":"I can't wait to play judge and give the gavel a sharp tap!","267648":"Did Archie tell you I planned to visit? I hope there's a convenient mooring for my flagship. I don't like long walks.","267649":"Treat me as you would any other guest.","267650":"Just so you know, I am not fond of garlic or profiteroles.","267651":"One approves! And it is nice to get out and about.","267652":"It all sounds very cheery so far. Make it cheerier.","267653":"Mind you, I do like it when things are special. You can do special?","267654":"May I express my gratitude for your sterling work preserving peace on the continent.","267655":"So this is the funny little island that's hosting the trial! Jolly good.","267656":"Now I'm here, I am of course impatient for the trial to begin.","267657":"A modern Queen must show she is able to dispense mercy. The man must be given fair hearing.","267658":"Where are all the witnesses?","267659":"Now we are finally all present, let this long overdue trial commence!","267660":"And where's the defendant?","267661":"I lick my lips at the prospect of another Goode family tribunal.","267666":"People who disappoint the monarch often end up with me.","267667":"And the Queen is going to be there. What a treat.","267668":"Don't think you will get all the plaudits. Crime is my bag.","267669":"Your sister is very keen to see justice done. I will use all the tools at my disposal to ensure that is the case.","267670":"The problem with public inquiries is everything's out in the open.","267671":"Imagine serving twenty years in the system, and never getting a sniff of a trial like this.","267672":"Obviously you'll need my official authorisation of transfer if you want your prisoner brought to the dock!","267673":"Everything relating to the prison and its prisoners has to go through me!","267674":"You cannot allow Bright Sands to be subjugated! Our childhood home!","267695":"Bright Sands! You must save them!","267696":"Uncle Edvard… He’s suffered enough, eldest. I believe I can forgive him now.","267697":"Now we are all that remains, eldest. I intend to take strength from that.","267698":"We will not give in to terror! Never!","267699":"We must avenge Edvard—the only way we can, father.","267700":"Come what may, I am not afraid.","267701":"There is only one way left, eldest.","267702":"What you did goes far beyond us, dear blood. You have saved us all from a reign of terror.","267703":"It shall be a proper funeral. Let us reunite the two brothers, side-by-side. Once and for all, confine the past to the past.","267704":"We must bury them both together in the family tomb.","267705":"Let us talk once Samuel and Edvard have taken their rightful place side by side.","267706":"I do not feel any more sadness, eldest. The clouds have lifted—azure skies lie beyond.","267707":"Have joy in your heart as you make these final arrangements.","267708":"They will not have Bright Sands!","267709":"Another glimmer! Isabel fights beside us.","267710":"They will not stop you, eldest. Lead us forth!","267711":"Fires rage everywhere! We must unmask these arsonists before its too late!","267712":"The arsonists must be intercepted!","267713":"Now the fires are out of control, and the arsonists still loose!","267714":"Quickly, the civilians! I won't see them swept up in the fighting!","267715":"Bright Sands is no place for civilians! We must come to their rescue!","267716":"Find a way to extract them unnoticed!","267717":"Poor, poor Edvard!","267718":"Edvard was ready to make peace with himself at the end.","267719":"Father always wanted you to have Bright Sands. The past cannot hold you any more.","267720":"Edvard died far better than he lived. He is forgiven.","267721":"If father had but held Edvard—shown his affection.","267722":"When I come here, I bring only cattails—for peace and prosperity.","267723":"These stones are not cold, but warm. The sun is shining again.","267724":"The past may be buried but it is not forgotten.","267725":"There will be nothing left of the city if the arsonists remain on the prowl!","267727":"The Pyrphorians have seized Bright Sands. They enchain it to their foul cause!","267747":"The sky above Bright Sands glow with maleficence!","267748":"It is time, old pal. Our nemesis approaches!","267749":"It is time we stamped out this fire for good.","267750":"When they see how bright you burn, old pal, they will shrivel.","267751":"The first of many victories!","267752":"You have my blade. I am ready.","267753":"Old friend, it's over! The last Pyrphorians are sunk!","267754":"Before all this began, I owed you a debt. I may have paid it now, but I've made up my mind to stay, help you grow, at least a little longer.","267755":"We fight with you, no matter what.","267763":"We can help you, just give us the sign.","267764":"Exploit their supply lines! Small operations can have big rewards!","267765":"Sabotage their supply lines! They rely on them as much as we do.","267766":"There is no dent in their supply! We missed an opportunity!","267767":"Ha, you did it! Without their precious fire they are nothing!","267768":"You broke the chain! Now we are really somewhere.","267769":"I never thought I would take the Empire's side!","267770":"The Queen has promised to recognise our independence.","267771":"I like Sir Archibald, he is a funny man.","267772":"This is all rather unusual. We are safe here?","267792":"This is unexpected. You are taking care of those beastly malefactors, aren't you?","267793":"A few angry hoodlums can't overthrow an Empire, can they?","267794":"I thought they must be after fame or riches, but they want to kill me.","267795":"I wonder what has become of the royal fleet…","267796":"Tell me they are not attacking this island? The one we are on?","267797":"I surrender myself wholly to your security arrangements.","267798":"I suppose then, my safety is in your hands.","267799":"Another player has had their island seized!","267800":"When we get out of this I promise you a whole duchy. Although, no, I can't actually promise that.","267801":"We are so happy to be finally allowed to leave this island. And for your heroism of course.","267802":"Under different circumstances, you might have called it a pleasant visit!","267803":"I'm sure we can make Isabel's tiny little chunk a protectorate of some sort.","267804":"A rival might take over your island!","267805":"The Pyrphorians must fall or civilisation will!","267819":"Under no circumstances must the Queen's safety be compromised!","267820":"You have won the day!","267821":"How shall I explain to her majesty that we are under siege…","267822":"This must be the Pyrphorian mothership!","267823":"My giddy aunt, that is no normal naval craft!","267824":"Without supplies, I'm not absolutely sure we can hold out…","267825":"The Queen must be saved at all costs!","267826":"Those supplies could be crucial in gaining the upper hand over our foes.","267827":"Reinforcements are coming! Our royal supply ships must pass unscathed!","267828":"We cannot afford to lose many more ships to our foe.","267829":"Perhaps this will bring their ringleader out of the woodwork.","267830":"Such reinforcements are going to be vital.","267831":"The Queen is saved! All thanks to your remarkable travails and hardships!","267832":"The battle for Bright Sands will decide the fate of civilisation!","267833":"The ever-increasing roar from the street will need a ruler as capable and wise as Her Majesty.","267835":"First Samuel, now Edvard! Soon I will be rid of your dreary family once and for all.","267848":"Goode & Sons. Favourites of the Royal Council. How I've enjoyed watching your family's slow and ignoble demise.","267849":"What a fool Edvard was to trust us!","267850":"Behold my solar barque!","267851":"Chivalry died with the monarchy! Your family of goodie-goodies was always likely to be first on my list.","267852":"Nothing can stop the turning of the wheel, or meek mice from crushing beneath!","267853":"Goode and Sons are the thorn in my side. Without it, the Queen shall come quietly!","267854":"The Empire has no hope of survival without its vassals!","267855":"You will die along with your goodie-goodie father!","267856":"Fools!

But trickery cannot match the power of a modern seaship!</b> Summarily demolished, a few of them are left clinging to wreckage. They beg to join your cause - unpaid. Such are the dwindling prospects of piracy in this day! The crew will jibe at them, but secretly all must be elated to have acquired such sea-wisdom for free.","800275":"<b>A pirate nuisance!</b> Though their scurvy deception gives them advantage, they are like many of their creed, rather jaded. By the time their ship is sunk, it has cost you a few good men. Yet the recovery of precious drinking water in among the flotsam, assuages the grief of your crew.","800276":"<b>Bloody pirates! A terrible menace even in this day and age!</b> Your crew are outmanoeuvred, outsmarted, and your ship is reeled-in for boarding. Many are killed in valiant defence of the company, but to no avail. Your vessel is duly ransacked for supplies, before the villains are again on their way.","800277":"The Ghost Ship","800279":"The Predator","800280":"<b>'A fearsome predator stalks us!'</b> the cabin-boy whispers. Perhaps he is right, for this resupply has not been as uneventful as hoped. Only the first evening moored in this bay, and a man goes missing - tracks up the beach into jungle. Many wonder how work can be expected to continue...","800281":"Bait the creature","800282":"Send hunters to track it","800283":"Speak with locals","800284":"Lay a trap","800285":"Leave the island","800286":"<b>With the perfect lure</b> placed enticingly in the crook of a tree, there is an inevitability about a capture. Sure enough, yellow eyes pierce the darkness, and a mighty beast pads softly over to the bait. A net is hurriedly cast about it and secured, thus leaving the expedition free to resupply unthreatened.","800287":"<b>Your huntmasters are expert,</b> and trace with great care, the soft hollows imprinted by feline paw. Led to a clearing, they correctly judge this to be a lair, where they stand ready with a net. When the cat returns, heaving hot breath, the hunters pounce. With net secure, the expedition is free to resupply unthreatened.","800288":"<b>At least one hunter did the right thing,</b> and kept his eyes open while they traced the beast's pawprints. Another was not so wise, and was heard to let out a scream. His comrades were drawn to the spot, and struck the majestic beast down. But not before the damage was done.","800289":"<b>Three days pass, and still no word.</b> There is a common feeling something must be done to save those men.","800290":"Send a rescue party","800291":"Wait a bit longer","800292":"Leave the island without them","800293":"<b>It is only something of a relief</b> when the rescue party return. It's bad news... the hunters are dead. The rescue party described the bright and long-maned beast, and how in a tussle, they slayed it. With the bodies of the hunters buried, the expedition is able to resupply in an atmosphere of respectful silence.","800294":"<b>'Horror! It's picking us off one by one!'</b> bawls a fearful sailor, for now the rescue party too, have failed to return. There is nothing for the disconsolate remainder of the crew to do, but leave this sorry place behind.","800295":"<b>Doubtful prayer brings no news</b> of the lost hunters. The men have nowhere to look for guidance, and there is a burdensome feeling that a decision must be made.","800296":"<b>Conviction in the lord is of little use here,</b> it seems. Two days later a hunter, whose leg is mangled, limps back into view. After the necessary amputation, he is heard to groan that the others perished. All must leave this savage place.","800297":"<b>'We leave them for dead,</b> when they could be right there now waiting for us!' cries a furious old tar. Like so many others, he is disgusted that good men should give their lives for nothing but impatience!","800298":"<b>'Absurd magic, but it works!'</b> say officers sent to the inland village for help. Having described the beast, they were referred to a witch. She encouraged them to ingest live scorpions, one of each colour; yellow, red and black. This they did reluctantly, but found when they confronted the animal, it took flight. All promptly follow the witch's advice, and sure enough, remain undisturbed for the remainder of the resupply.","800299":"<b>'Our plight means nothing to the locals,'</b> bemoan the officers sent as diplomats. 'Telling them beasts stalk the jungle, is as like alerting a hatter to the presence of hats on his hatstands.'","800300":"<b>'Their deity is desecrated!'</b> urges the officer sent as diplomat. All around the bay, daubed faces appear, bows raised to the expedition camp.","800301":"Teach them a lesson","800302":"Run for the ship!","800303":"<b>'A hollow victory',</b> say the men. For the locals lie dead, but the jungle beast stalks on.","800304":"<b>Odds against them, the men fight as best they can.</b> Fought back onto the sand, they deflect the rain of arrows with whatever they can lay hands on. A relay is able to return precious equipment to the ship and set sail, but not without a number of casualties, of whom some do not make it.","800305":"<b>The onslaught is deadly.</b> Few among your crew have the requisite experience to defend themselves, and so the sand reddens with their blood. Of those who make it as far as the expedition ship, a number succumb to the poison-tip arrows. It is a massacre.","800306":"<b>'Run!' comes the panicked cry.</b> The men drop their work, and tramp desperately through the shallows to the ship. A volley of arrows pierces three, squirting crimson into the clear blue. 'Dead aside, we have lost a great deal more in provisions than we have gained,' laments the quartermaster, as your ship departs that wretched bay.","800307":"<b>The ingenious powers</b> of the craftsmen among your crew have fashioned a pitfall for the beast. There is not long to wait before there is a tinkle on the handbell, and all can gather above the trap to see the monster growling at its bottom. The resupply may now happily proceed, knowing that danger is averted.","800308":"<b>The beast is too intelligent</b> to fall for makeshift traps. It is clearly evading the pitfall prepared by those supposed to be the expedition's deftest craftsmen. 'Little more we can do,' they shrug.","800309":"<b>'It's a considerable setback,'</b> say senior officers. Fresh water, wood for burning, plants for medicine - it does no good to list what myriad opportunities are missed in bypassing the bay. And all for the sake of fears over one measly wild animal.","800312":"Opera House in the Jungle","800313":"<b>'It's too narrow and shallow this far upriver!'</b> warns the steersman. Escorting Mr. Cardinale to the site of his rainforest opera house now seems all the more preposterous! The great patron of the arts twizzles his moustache in frustration! Apart from braving the difficulty ahead, only traversing a nearby hill might reconnect the expedition with the upper river.","800314":"Use your gunboat to navigate the shallows","800315":"Have the ship transported over the hill to rejoin the river further up","800316":"Attempt to carefully navigate the narrow passage","800317":"Decline to proceed any further and return to sea","800318":"<b>The design of the gunboat is vital to your success.</b> Being of moderate size, and yet possessing the manoeuvring capabilities of a much smaller ship, the gunboat is able to navigate the awkward river shallows with ease. Mr. Cardinale is delighted that you have delivered him to the site of his proposed Opera House, and promises to talk favourably of each and every man when he returns to civilisation.","800319":"<b>'What a champion performance!' squeals Mr. Cardinale,</b> from the comfort of his cushioned chair. The great ship seems to swim up and over the hill. The long timbers on which it rolls, and corkscrew winches at intervals up the slope work perfectly. 'I shall put in a good word for you all at the club,' promises Cardinale, as the ship splashes down safely on the other side. The men are immensely proud of the miracle they have performed.","800320":"<b>Getting a ship over a hill is mad, but it works.</b> 'Is this absolutely necessary?' muses Mr. Cardinale having watched the crew slip for a week in mud. But the rolling timbers and makeshift winches they have crafted prove adequate, and the ship finally scrapes down the other side, into the upper river. Mr. Cardinale barely offers a word of thanks, perturbed perhaps, by the indignity of it all.","800321":"<b>There simply aren't enough materials</b> to conduct such an elaborate enterprise. The crew think with a few extra bits and bobs, dragging the ship up the hill might be possible.","800322":"<b>'I think it's going to give way!' cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale.</b> The feet of your men slip and slide on the mudstrewn slope, as the great weight of the ship plummets it back down the hill. Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. A hideous accident caused by inadequate materials, that signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800323":"Proceed uphill without materials, belief will guide us through","800324":"Ask the locals gathered around the scene if they are able to help","800325":"<b>The men have the conviction</b> to safely hoist the ship up and over the hill. It is a fatiguing week, but belief in making the impossible possible possesses them. When the ship finally splashes into the water, Mr. Cardinale has barely a Christian word of thanks for the crew. It has taken a long enough after all.","800326":"<b>It is all going so well,</b> this mad idea, with winches and cables scarcely sufficient for the task. But exertion eventually tells. As the ship rocks over the crest of the hill, there is not enough to keep it there, and it hurtles wildly down the other side. It is lucky the ship is not swept away in the river current. Still, it sustains significant damage from impact with the trees.","800327":"<b>'I think it's going to give way!'</b> cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale. The feet of your men slip and slide on the slope, as the unholy weight of the ship overcomes the winches, and it plummets back down the hill. Men try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800328":"<b>The locals are willing to provide help and materials.</b> While it takes the crew time to incorporate the materials into their winch design, the locals are happy to wait. Good relations make the feat of hoisting a ship over a hill less painful than it might have been. The boat finally clatters down into the water of the upper river. All are most grateful to the locals, without whom none of this would have been possible.","800329":"<b>A few locals vaguely offer to help,</b> but their lukewarm efforts do little to relieve the exhausted crew. The ridiculous hill-climb takes more than a week. When the ship finally slips into the water over the other side, not even Mr. Cardinale has energy enough to care.","800330":"<b>The locals have absolutely no interest in helping you,</b> and fade into the trees. Beleaguered by shouts from Mr. Cardinale, the men meekly follow orders. The mad persistence has disastrous consequences. The ship plummets back down the hill! Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800331":"<b>Competent navigation</b> rescues your ship from the mother of all rivers. Mr. Cardinale is tremulous throughout, believing his dreams may beach like a river dolphin at any time. But over the course of three tricky days, information is relayed quickly enough between wheel and forecastle to avoid any harmful collisions. There is relief all around when the corner is made and the river broadens again.","800332":"<b>'Rapids?!' exhales Mr. Cardinale crossly.</b> Ahead white water churns. There is nothing for it but to push on. As the ship strains against the current, there are dreadful noises from rocks on the keel. The crew wince at each and every thump and screech. Finally, after a week, the river broadens again, and the crew can inspect the damage - it doesn't look good.","800333":"<b>It is a heart-breaking experience.</b> Days go by in the effort to lever the ship out of the sandy shallows, where it does not belong. It is battered by rocks and rapids, and leaks like a rusted bucket. Mr. Cardinale kicks up and awful fuss. Finally when it feels like progress is being made, the next bend reveals a harrowing sight - an insurmountable waterfall! Never have the crew felt more hopeless.","800334":"<b>Mr. Cardinale is incensed</b> that his grand plans for the rainforest Opera House have been thwarted. Some of the men find his blustering funny, but the officers are horrified that such an influential figure has been rebuffed, and are afraid to show their faces in society ever again.","800336":"The Minefield","800337":"<b>At the cry of 'mines!', all rush to the prow.</b> Sure enough, several of the conical terrors bob seductively below. 'Who knows how many of these infernal machines have passed us by, or yet await us. A false move, and this sea shall be a lake of fire! What the devil do we do?'","800338":"Use dynamite to start a chain reaction","800339":"<b>'The way ahead is clear as the eye can see!'</b> says the delighted officer, folding up his telescope. As the last motes of fire trail down into the waves and fizzle, the crew can but admire such brave use of dynamite. 'Better than fireworks!' says another, 'The men have never been so entertained!'","800340":"Try to navigate the minefield","800341":"<b>'We are masters of the sea!'</b> sing the triumphant crew, as the ship weaves easily beyond the last line of mines. 'Even Odysseus, when faced with Scylla and Charybdis, lost men. We have lost none of our company, and our bonds only strengthen!' Soon, a special bottle is being uncorked, and toasts raised to the continued success of the expedition!","800342":"<b>'What was that noise?' gulps the helmsman,</b> but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess.","800343":"<b>While at first plain sailing, the minefield is now gooey with danger.</b> A line of densely-packed mines stand between the ship and freedom. 'With some makeshift device, we can clear the path ahead,' explains the officer, 'I'm afraid to say, it is the only way we shall get out of this in one piece.'","800344":"<b>The awfulness has barely begun.</b> Restless waves conceal a thickening of the mines, and the ship's haphazard path makes impact inevitable. 'Brace!' scream port-side, just prior to a portion of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who have lost many good sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.","800348":"Build that device","800349":"<b>'She survived! It worked!' calls the lookout,</b> as makeshift grapples trailing behind the little dinghy are able to hook the mines aside. Relief only comes, of course, once the expedition ship is clear of this last line of mines. 'How did we get in such a pickle?' says one. 'At least we're out of it,' says another.","800350":"<b>A nervous sailor rows towards the line of mines.</b> The makeshift grappling hooks trailing behind his dinghy are intended to drag mines out of the path of the expedition ship. Unfortunately the sailor is a sacrificial goat. A grapple shatters the horns of a nearby mine, and the boat and its sailor explode in plume. Safe passage means nothing to those from whom a good friend was taken.","800351":"<b>The idea is a terrible one from the start.</b> The lengthy poles, comprised of other poles, are unwieldy and inaccurate, even in the hands of a several strong men. The crew's attempt to poke mines away when they draw near is suicide. Two booms come in succession, and a few feeble cheers at escape are drowned by the deafening wails. Few are left to bail water, when so many lie dead or injured.","800352":"Go through diplomatic papers in search of any clues","800353":"<b>The search is a fruitful one.</b> The well-organised diplomatic library includes a comprehensive folio of papers on nearby mine positions. This enables the navigators to chart a safe course through the waters. The very same paper remarks that the mines were moored during the war, in order to protect a now-disused outpost. You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.","800354":"<b>The search is worthwhile.</b> After a few hours scouring the diplomatic archives, a paper on nearby mine positions is found. This gives the navigators the difficult task of charting a safe course through the waters. No-one is quite sure if the information given is up-to-the-minute, but when the last line of mines is cleared, all are suitably relieved.","800355":"<b>The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.</b> A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.","800356":"<b>Optimism makes way for abject terror,</b> as the map of mines that is found and used for navigation turns out to be completely false. Terrible detonations devastate the ship's timbers, and countless lives are lost. 'Misinformation is worse than no information,' an officer laments, as his tears bleed the ink of the erroneous chart, which as it happens, refers to a different stretch of water.","800357":"Turn around and try to escape","800358":"<b>A few saintly volunteers approach,</b> offering to scout back the way you came and ease your escape. Asked if they aren't afraid of the cone-shaped mines, they reply 'The lord will see us through.'","800359":"Allow them to go ahead","800360":"Tell them to stay on the ship","800361":"<b>The volunteers exude calm,</b> as their lone dinghy traces a path much akin to that which got you into this mess. Although their silent vigil transports you to safety, all agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.","800362":"<b>While the path the volunteers cut is a true one,</b> it does not account for the difference in size between the two ships. It only takes a narrow graze to explode one of the mines, and though no lives are lost, the damage to your ship is significant. The crew are dismayed by the situation.","800363":"<b>For the godless dinghy, doom seems inevitable</b> the moment it drops and a man slops overboard. This inauspicious beginning foreshadows the disaster to follow. Prayers unheard, steering in the rough current proves impossible. The little boat is last seen careening towards the sinister cones it sought to avoid. 'The terrible loss of life shall remain with me all my days,' says a devastated officer.","800364":"<b>It is horrifying that most significant members of the crew</b> are aboard this fragile dinghy. Of course one would not wish a mine to explode any loyal man, but when it bellows up below a collection of your finest, death stings all the more. The crew are understandably devastated at the destruction they have witnessed first-hand. Life feels as if it may never be the same again.","800365":"<b>Your faith goes untried</b> in the nervous silence, as the ship escapes the mine trap the same way it entered. All agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.","800366":"<b>Your faith does not go untried.</b> The sinister cones have moved about over time, and no matter how truly the ship follows its original course, it is inevitable a mine will burst into the hull. Luckily when the blast comes, no man dies. Still, the burdensome schedule of repair disheartens the crew.","800367":"<b>None of it is of any use.</b> Your godforsaken crew do not realise how the sinister cones move about over time. No matter how true the course, more than one mine shakes the ship's belly as it limps clear. Many lives are lost, and the damage to the ship is severe.","800391":"Reward Event","800392":"You found some mysterious item","800396":"You found a tourist that offers to trade with you.","800441":"You have found a radiant relic! The crew toast the success of your archaeological expedition. May we now better understand what it is to be human!","800448":"You have captured a wild animal! The crew toast the success of your zoological expedition. This can only aid studies of the natural world!","800454":"You have earned a reward for your altruism! The crew toast a successful rescue, with all returning to the glad comforts of home.","800460":"You have discovered pirate bounty! With the dread buccaneers blown out of the water, a search of their sunken wreck unearths a well-deserved reward!","800467":"Love Island","800468":"<b>A matter of the heart.</b> The crew have been enjoying some island hospitality, but many are now refusing to leave. They have fallen in love with the sons and daughters of the local king. Perhaps he can be convinced to allow them to come with you? You can attempt to come to an arrangement, or else wait for him to consult his copper oracle.","800470":"Offer a wedding gift","800471":"Convince the king your crew's affection is genuine","800472":"Await the verdict of the copper oracle","800473":"Leave without the crew who've fallen in love","800474":"<b>The king is not only surprised,</b> but moved to tears by the romantic composers he hears via the gramophone. He insists on a grand banquet to celebrate the union of his children and your crew. Both traditional music and a few cranks of the new-fangled gramophone accompany the beautiful ceremony, and then its bon voyage!","800475":"<b>The king is delighted to see his children wed.</b> Delicate understanding of local custom and a smattering of their language allow a message of true love to be conveyed. The king evidently thinks his children in good hands. Feasting, and to the amusement of all, terrible dancing, follows. For his departing children, it shall be the longest, most fascinating honeymoon.","800476":"<b>Something is lost in translation.</b> Yet the king smiles benignly, as if your crew still have a chance to prove themselves. 'He suggests a great hunt,' says your diplomat, 'or else we may await arcane judgment.' His eyes flick to a copper oracle on a dais.","800477":"<b>The awkward gestures and diagrams in the sand</b> prove highly offensive to the king and his people. Sensing outrage, the crew back away towards the ship. The angry locals fire arrows at their former amours. Fittingly, one is struck in the heart, and bleeds out into the brine. The rest return lovelorn, to their dreary maps and compasses.","800478":"Capture the king a prize animal","800479":"Face the verdict of the copper oracle","800480":"<b>The hunt goes quite well.</b> Beautiful boars inhabit the woods, and though tricky to catch, are little trouble for your experts. Though the king will still not allow you to leave with his children, the feast of boar brings everyone together in the moment. The lovers understand this moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.","800481":"<b>The hunt is not perfect.</b> The crew show courage in pursuit of a tiger, which draws the king's admiration. Sadly, they cannot catch it, which leaves the king wondering if your men will be able to provide once married. Thus, he decides not to let his children leave. Some of your crew remain committed to staying behind, and it is with regret you must continue without them.","800482":"<b>Your naive hunters fail the test.</b> Forest deer are everywhere, and hunting them hardly seems a challenge. Had your so-named 'hunters' any respect for nature, they'd have realised the sacred deer were not what the king was after. Instead they gather them up greedily. The king makes it perfectly clear your expedition must move on. With heavy hearts, the sailors return to the ship.","800483":"<b>The oracle predicts a reassuring fate for all.</b> Those who wish to remain for love will live fulfilling lives, but the same shall be true for those still committed to your expedition. All parties feel a sense of peace. Your voyage shall continue without any resentment towards those it leaves behind.","800484":"<b>The copper oracle is disappointingly undecided.</b> The king cannot, in good faith, allow his children to leave to an uncertain destiny. His ultimatum is that your crew become part of his extensive family or else they must leave alone. Though understandable, it is nevertheless regrettable when some decide to stay behind.","800485":"<b>The copper oracle predicts that your souls cannot be saved.</b> With your crew rotten to the core, the king makes it clear there can be no union with his children, and that you are no longer welcome. Heart-broken and bearing the burden of sin, the crew return to the triviality of duty.","800486":"<b>The copper oracle sees only purity in your crew's hearts.</b> It predicts a bounteous future for the king's children, and so with tearful pride, he gives the couples his blessing. The traditional ceremony is both spiritually uplifting and wholesome.","800487":"<b>The copper oracle reveals a little doubt in your crew's hearts.</b> The king interprets that his children will only be happy if they remain on the island., and that some of your sailors are not in love, but merely infatuated. Still, you must lose the fine crew who have formed genuine bonds.","800488":"<b>The copper oracle reveals great doubt in your crew's hearts.</b> The king does not for a minute believe that your inconstant crew are as deep in love as they claim. If they cannot demonstrate otherwise, it might be better if your people left.","800489":"<b>The copper oracle proclaims your crew's hearts sinful and wicked.</b> Arm-in-arm with their new-found amours, the sailors await some happy answer. But the moment the king's arm is raised, daggers unsheathe, plunging into the hearts of the would-be lovers. Speechless and unharmed, the rest are free to leave the island, pondering the grave cost of faithlessness.","800490":"Try to convince the king your crew is worthy","800491":"Order the crew to leave at once","800492":"<b>Careful diplomacy has him thinking twice.</b> Perhaps there is a way for the crew to prove themselves. A lean champion steps forward. Fighting him may impress the king, or else you can try and outhunt him.","800493":"<b>The king is offended by your insolence.</b> Without a word he boards a boat and heads out to sea. Some foolishly follow, believing he can be reasoned with, but they have even less knowledge of local boats than local customs. Their bodies will be dredged from the reef as your tactless expedition struggles on.","800494":"Propose a contest of champions","800495":"Propose a hunting competition","800496":"<b>You have your champions.</b> One-by-one the suitors fight the king's champion. Those who prevail, it turns out, are permitted to take their lovers to sea. Some fail, but can at least drown their sorrows during the farewell celebration that follows.","800497":"<b>It is not a pleasant sight for the faint of heart.</b> Your best champion is put forward, and subsequently knocked about the head for the entirety of the contest. At the end a cloth is needed to conceal the disfigured face. The king expresses his condolences for your loss, but all is fair in love and war.","800498":"<b>It is close but the king's champion is outfoxed.</b> By sundown your best hunter has claimed six boars to their five. The king will still not allow you to leave with his children, but the feast of boar brings everyone together in one moment. The lovers understand a moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.","800499":"<b>Lacking the skill, your hunters try to cheat.</b> Without knowledge of the island's fauna, they decide to follow the king's hunters in the hope of poaching the animal they are tracking. But they are led a merry dance. Three days pass, and your champion is missing presumed dead. The crew have no choice but to depart, tail between their legs.","800500":"<b>Paradise lost!</b> The expedition may be back underway, but the mood is abject as the beautiful island becomes but painful memory. Too painful for one, who is discovered dead, it is said, by way of a broken heart.","800501":"<b>It is a significant blow.</b> Any happiness the crew might feel at their comrades finding love is consumed by feelings of resentment. How could they have been so selfish? The expedition goes on, but those who are still a part must take on twice as much work.","800503":"The Singular Case of the Midshipman","800504":"<b>The Midshipman is found with his throat slit, knife in hand.</b> It would appear to be suicide, but appearances often prove deceptive. Understandably, the whole crew crowd the scene, debating whether he was the type to take his own life, or if someone might have gained by his passing. Needless to say, they expect some action be taken...","800506":"The Expert will have the answers","800507":"Commence an investigation","800508":"Do nothing, it's suicide - nothing more to be said","800509":"<b>There are gasps of macabre delight,</b> as the famous detective reveals the only possible solution. 'Elementary you see. Look at this tiny moth wing on the body. Moths are drawn to light, and the sole light this night past issued from... this man's LANTERN!!' The detective lunges across the deck and secures the watchman, who being as impressed with the deduction as everyone else, readily admits to having sought to gain rank by the murder.","800510":"<b>Careful analysis of the scene</b> reveals two leads. Some believe an autopsy would leave the facts of the case plain, while others reckon the little time available should be spent analysing any evidence at the scene that might establish whodunnit.","800511":"<b>This lot aren't bloodhounds that's for sure,</b> and turn up nothing even with a strong whiff of murder about it all. With the incompetent investigation ending conspicuously silent, the crew must last the remainder of the expedition in fear they are marked next on the list.","800512":"Conduct an autopsy of the body","800513":"Fashion a tool for gathering forensic evidence","800514":"<b>The autopsy is conducted very capably,</b> and confirms the midshipman took his own life. A severe tumour is also discovered on the midshipman's brain. A letter, found later, serves to explain that the fellow knew he hadn't long to live, and wished to face death in his own way. The crew are galvanised on hearing this story of bravery.","800515":"<b>The autopsy is sufficient to confirm it was murder.</b> Strangulation was the cause of death, not a slit throat - which was added post-mortem. All else remains unknown. Nevertheless, with the cause of death established, the list of suspects is narrowed down to just a few who had the means and the motive for the crime.","800516":"<b>The autopsy is dreadfully clumsy,</b> and leaves the body almost unrecognisable. The unschooled 'medic' evidently have a point to prove, and insist on defiling it further, despite being a bundle of nerves. By the end the morgue looks like a butchery, and the stricken mortician runs wildly about the ship, scalpel in hand. Several are injured trying to restrain him, but the psychological trauma of an unsolved mystery is twice as damaging.","800517":"Interrogate until someone confesses","800518":"Beat out a confession","800519":"<b>You out the grim truth.</b> The alibi of one sailor does not match his fellows, and he cracks, confessing to the midshipman's murder. It transpires the midshipman had bragged of bedding the other man's wife. The murderer expresses only remorse for his crime, and as the noose is placed around his neck, the crew regret that justice must be so severe.","800520":"<b>The interrogation is painfully haphazard.</b> Though it is clear one of the suspects must be the killer, lines of inquiry fail to produce answers. No option remains but to offload all the suspects at the next port to prevent further incident. It is a source of great shame to the crew that fine innocent sailors are certain to be among them.","800521":"<b>A brutal approach, but one delivering quick results.</b> It seems the midshipman was preparing to whistle-blow unauthorised smuggling below deck, and was killed for it. The ringleaders threatened others with a similar fate if they didn't keep quiet. The culprits are unceremoniously shot, and the vulgar matter is over.","800522":"<b>Torture seldom results in happiness.</b> Your victim screams a confession, perhaps in the hope it will end the pain. With nothing else to go on, you scapegoat the poor beggar, and he is keelhauled until dead. The crew are in no doubt that this was the wrong man, and hope to escape your inhuman expedition at the first opportunity.","800523":"<b>What innovation!</b> A bright young spark applies some of the latest forensic researches. The knife used to cut the midshipman's neck is placed inside an airtight box along with vapours belonging to the doctor. As if by magic, when removed, clear sets of fingerprints appear on the shaft! When the crew prints are taken, the guilty party is collared in the most satisfying modern fashion!","800524":"<b>It's complicated</b> identifying footwear and gait. Ambitious of the crew then, to attempt to solve both problems with the one device. Still the notched stick-wheel does prove footprints at the scene are suspicious, and that suspects are limited to just a few matches. But how to get to the bottom of this?","800525":"<b>Fragile justice!</b> As your craftsmen stare at an empty drawing board, gormless sailors think they help by tidying up the crime scene. With the investigation fumbled, the killer feels he has to take two more lives before he is finally caught. 'Can't believe how sloppy you are in the art of policing,' he teases, 'I could have killed ten more before you'd found me.' Caught he may be, but the damage is already done.","800526":"Let there be a trial","800527":"Put the fear of god into the suspects","800528":"Dump all the suspects at the next port, and be done with it","800529":"<b>The trial goes as well as can be expected.</b> The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was  trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.","800530":"<b>The trial is a farce.</b> Sailors bark questions from the sidelines which the suspects are quite within their rights to leave unanswered. But this obstinacy serves only to rile the shouting mob! They flood through the makeshift courtroom and carry the suspects kicking and screaming to deck, before tossing them over the side.","800532":"<b>It's almost like divine intervention.</b> The priest hears each suspect alone, and once the god-fearing killer breaks down and confesses, he is handed his rope. Still, a lack of forgiveness does not trouble the crew, who are relieved this ungodly chapter is now closed.","800533":"<b>These are not god-fearing sailors,</b> and hear the priest's weak plea for the killer to come forward with impassive expressions. Perhaps there is a different approach.","800534":"The Singular Case of the Midshipman","800537":"The Visitation","800538":"<b>An undesirable visitor haunts the ship.</b> Fleeting silhouettes, knocking and screeching sounds. Each morning the ship appears in utter disarray. 'A night fiend,' gulps the hardiest of old crewmen, as he sweeps debris from the deck. As night draws in again, you realise something must be done.","800539":"Listen to your expert","800540":"Perform an exorcism","800541":"Find the culprit","800542":"Ignore the menace","800543":"<b>Every right to a little joke.</b> 'These claw marks!' the naturalist feigns horror. 'Is it something terrible?!' asks a fearful sailor. But the naturalist can bite tongue no longer, and succumbs to laughter; 'No! Good heavens. We have a mother and kittens aboard!' The cat family is found in a barrel, which, it is agreed, shall serve as their home for the duration. The crew dote on the little rascals, their presence a great comfort.","800544":"<b>Each sailor strides with inner conviction,</b> as they form a procession of candles behind the smug-looking priest, flooding holy light into every heathen crevice. The priest's ritual is unfaltering, and not only are the crew rid of the night-time menace, but now believe it is god's plan the expedition will succeed.","800545":"<b>The crew has its sceptics,</b> even though the exorcism seems at first to have worked. Two days later a sailor cries, 'It had glowing yellow eyes!' upon having sighted the demon near the hold. The unholy thing must be caught.","800546":"Bait the thing with food","800547":"<b>It is nothing so savage.</b> All are concealed around the strip of meat, expecting the worst. But what descends from the rafters of the hold, silent and gentle winged, is a luminous white owl. It is an ambiguous omen, according to those that know, but the sailors are content to keep it aboard.","800548":"<b>Whatever it is, it is far too clever.</b> It avoids the bait, but continues its night raids. Rumour this is an offended Klabautermann are substantiated by several separate accounts. Little voices overheard, brief sightings, even the discovery of a miniature table and chair. Some can live with the impish nuisance, but many will jump ship at the next port..","800549":"Build a trap to catch the thing","800550":"<b>The cage-trap is well-made,</b> and daybreak reveals an unlikely specimen encaged. 'A sort of badger?' is the first analysis, which in actuality, is fairly far from the mark. The compendium of animalia in the ship's library reveals it a 'northern raccoon', also remarking that is 'quite edible.'","800551":"<b>The snapping trap is weak and flimsy.</b> The crew are excited by a sharp sound, but rush to the scene, only to find the bait gone, and the trap in disrepair. A piece of bright red felt caught in the spring explains all. 'Klabautermann!' they despair, for it is a terrible omen to offend a sea goblin as they have done.","800552":"<b>The crew don't have much belief,</b> and the priest makes a hash of the exorcism. If anything, his fragmented delivery only agitates the creature. The next night, a sailor is adamant he has sighted something 'irrefutably demonic.'","800553":"<b>The faithless crew never take any part of the exorcism seriously.</b> 'What's the point of hocus-pocus when its but greedy sailors stealing?!' yells one man. Accusations fly between conspiracy theorists, until a violent brawl breaks out. At the next mooring, the injured parties desert your godless expedition.","800554":"Gather arms and confront it","800555":"Sate the demon with a sacrificial offering","800556":"Don't anger the creature further","800557":"<b>Rather excessive.</b> The soldiery tense as strange noises draw near. Fingers itch upon triggers. The moment demon wings flap into view, the night is lit up with powder. Finally the smoke subsides, and the mangled thing is revealed to be nothing more than a bat. Troops thunder heavily about the ship, before discovering the rest of the hog-nosed critters in the hold. Everyone is left feeling utterly stupid.","800558":"<b>Your lily-livered cowards quiver like jelly!</b> Fear chokes them as they spin wildly about looking for something to shoot that they can't see. Two are so panicked they bump together, causing the other to suddenly fire. Shot hits an angelic young sailor, killing instantly. The night terror is gone, but has taken for payment the most undeserving of souls.","800559":"<b>A man's finger for a stowaway weasel!</b> In good faith, a pious sailor volunteers the pinkie of his right hand as a votive offering. But at the smell of blood, it is a slinky little mustelid that appears. With the weasel caught and caged, the night terror is over, but the sailors will not forgive or forget the loss of a good man's finger.","800560":"<b>Sacrilege!</b> A prohibited tome is consulted, the vile solicitations of its pages consuming the crew! Unspeakable acts are performed upon a man, so that the demon can be assuaged. Yet still the menace remains, and worse, the crew's sacrificial victim bleeds out from his injuries.","800561":"<b>The practical joke is ruined.</b> The bored sailors bemoan the pathetic response to their little entertainment. That the senior officers have been duped by an obvious ruse, makes all severely doubt their fitness to lead.","800563":"<b>Your sharp-nosed hunters pick up a scent.</b> Pungent droppings demarcate a perimeter, in the centre of which is a crate with a hole. A sailor reaches his arm bravely in. There is a brief struggle, and a whine like the ones at night, before the troublemaker is pulled out. It is a common garden fox. The cunning little creature becomes the crew's talisman for the remainder of the expedition.","800564":"<b>Hunters find tracks, but can't say what made them.</b> The marks are indeed strange - disturbing almost. Claw marks that go deep in the decking, as if the unspeakable thing that made them was in some frenzy.","800565":"<b>The hunters stumble guilelessly into its trap.</b> The night is unfeasibly pitch, and the hunters' lamps extinguish. Who knows why, without a breath of wind? A scratching draws near. Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence.  Just like that, the fiend  has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed.","800566":"Smoke it out of hiding","800567":"Build a trap to catch whatever it is","800568":"Pray together against the spirit","800569":"<b>Reassuringly human coughing comes from within.</b> It turns out you have a stowaway - a young girl wishing to escape a life of hardship. She is spirited., and the crew take to her quickly. She is given work to do, and food to eat. All believe she shall prove their good luck charm.","800570":"<b>Knowing its habits helps.</b> The box is made to measure, and along with its clever latch, is placed where the fiend seems most often to be. The box is found in the morning, with a gigantic rat inside it. The trap appears to have killed it, and that is the end of the matter.","800571":"<b>The ramshackle trap box is in bits the next morning.</b> While to some they appear benign, the claw marks appear more frequently. Once a man wakes with his cheeks gouged. Some are so perturbed by the night demon, that they slink off the ship at the next available harbour.","800572":"<b>A feeling of calm descends upon the crew.</b> The prayer seems to fill the spiritual void in the sailor's breasts. Approaching the world with a new perspective means even if the unexplained episodes at night persist, they pay it no mind.","800573":"<b>The communal prayer is broken by more wild shrieking.</b> It matters not that, apart from vanishing supplies, the mischievous spirit seems fairly harmless. The crew are deeply troubled, and worry their souls are lost.","800574":"<b>The menace is very persistent.</b> Restless nights, devoured food, and stolen supplies shall go unexplained and unresolved for the remainder of the expedition. The crew are at their wit's end.","800575":"Lost in the Desert","800576":"<b>The map of these endless dunes is a swindle.</b> The first officer turns to berate the guide from whom they were purchased, but the fellow is already gone, as if the sands had swallowed him up. A solitary well offers a slight dribble of consolation, but your men must otherwise come to terms with being rather lost.","800577":"Use a reflective object to signal help","800578":"Navigate by the stars","800579":"Wait for a sign of the true path","800580":"Walk stubbornly in one direction","800581":"<b>A local rider comes to the rescue.</b> He saunters over on his camel, and explains the well is part of a lost city, accessible over a small rise. The crew are enchanted by the grand quarry, swept over by the sands of time, observations of which shall no doubt bring them fame on their return. After proof of their remarkable discovery has been gathered, the rider is only too glad to lead the elated crew back to more familiar dunes.","800582":"<b>Clear desert nights are perfect for astronomers.</b> Beneath a black cloak lucid with the constellations, your expert navigators school the remainder in mankind's relation to the heavenly bodies. It is a moment of realisation for many. Enlightened, the crew return to the ship filled with the wonder of the desert and their place in the universe.","800583":"<b>Something of a path appears</b>, though as much by luck as star-gazing. A little way along it, a silhouette crenellates the night - an imposing fortress. Too tired for trouble, you wonder if it is worth knocking at the grand door.","800584":"<b>The \"stars are fickle\", say your officers by way of excuse.</b> After traveling for a while, the familiar shape of the well appears in the darkness. Your men have been walking in a circle.","800585":"<b>The stars utterly perplex your party.</b> With romantic notions dashed, the crew look around for some landmark, but instead find a featureless wasteland. They are desperately lost. Water, food and hope are in increasingly short supply. But even in a desert, there must be a way...","800586":"Ask at the fort for help","800587":"Ignore the fort and continue along the path","800588":"<b>The occupant Sultan welcomes you in.</b> He introduces himself in his own tongue, and is impressed by your interpreters. \"You are far from what you seek. Stay, replenish for the journey ahead.\" Thus the crew enjoy the Sultan's hospitality while they can, for it will ease the last stretch of their journey.","800589":"<b>You lack the means to communicate.</b> Believing you to be an invasion force, the paranoid Sultan orders hot oil be poured from the ramparts. There is no escaping for one, eaten alive by the molten cascade. Resuming your desert path is the only option. The journey is a wearying lament for a fallen friend, meandering slowly back to civilisation.","800590":"<b>It is a long and draining journey.</b> Finally the crew limp exhausted into a settlement, from where it will no doubt be possible to procure the appropriate charts. Most would be happy never to see those grumpy old camels ever again.","800591":"Follow the local wildlife","800592":"Divine for Water","800593":"Move bravely on","800594":"<b>Desperate thanks are due to a dung beetle.</b> As it scuttles along, those less capable in coleopterology cast doubt on the value of pursuing it. There is a minor scuffle in the sand before at last the bloody-nosed experts are listened to. The jolly beetle leads to owl dung, and owls in turn to farmland. Thus the embittered and exhausted crew are saved from desiccation.","800595":"<b>A wild goose chase to desolation.</b> Though the ostrich your crew have found cannot fly, it lollops along at surprisingly high speed. They try in vain to follow, but the sun is twice its usual size, and the bird is gone. Hot sand melts soles, and feet begin to swell. The water is out. Those that make it must have some evolutionary adaptation, because for most the desert is to be their graveyard.","800596":"<b>Your reprobates have no knowledge of desert mysteries.</b> The divining rod has wasted enough of your time, and your caravan is nearly through the water.","800597":"<b>A pretty price for divine mercy.</b> The Y-shaped stick leads all on a meandering path. One insists on stopping to dig, and is left behind. It is a wasted, and fatal effort. After two days of hardship, the rest stumble over a crest to discover the wide blue sea, their mocking ship upon it.","800598":"<b>The sun is unspeakably hot.</b> As the bedraggled lumber back to civilisation, there are wiltings among them. It is too much for the others to turn their heads. Bodies slumping to ash and dust, lost to the waves of a powder sea.","800599":"<b>Star of wonder, star of light!</b> Your wise magi are stirred by an unusually bright celestial body, that is surely a sign! It foretells a spiritual pilgrimage through the desert leading to a Garden of Eden. A grove of flowing streams, orange and incense, where like-minded devotees congregate. Your crew feel blessed, and the expedition can resume with new-found devotion.","800600":"<b>Are the gods testing you?</b> You wait and wait but there is not yet a sign.","800601":"<b>The omen is a ravaging howl.</b> \"Water in the desert?! it's coming from everywhere!\" Already up to their necks in strong current, the weak swimmers flounder like ants in a bathtub. Those that do not drown must wait until morning to look upon the aftermath. \"A flood from heaven, to punish the wicked,\" say the survivors, as they trudge back to civilisation.","800602":"<b>You are extremely lucky to survive.</b> The crew whinge and whine the whole way about scattergun strategy. After a day without shade, a fight even breaks out. But sticking to the fixed heading eventually leads, not before time, back to some kind of reality.","800603":"<b>Your expedition boils.</b> Further and further it goes, into the desert's incandescent interior. Each soul more and more convinced that redemption is over the next dune. But it is not. Three days later, the party might have felt relief at the sight of a caravan, but instead end up wishing they had died with their comrades.","800605":"A Grizzly Encounter","800606":"<b>Bear attack!</b> The party ponder this very real possibility as threatening grunts stop them dead among the firs. Fifty yards ahead, a huge specimen lurches up on two legs like a totem, standing between them and escape. More grunting echoes nearby. The party stay silent, awaiting guidance.","800607":"Scare the bears away","800608":"Use hunting knowledge to get the better of the bears","800609":"Attack the bear blocking the way","800610":"Use Camouflage","800611":"<b>Boooooom!</b> The valley shudders with the sweet stench of exploded dynamite. The bears hurry away, leaving the crew thoroughly entertained at the superiority of mankind and the power of invention.","800612":"<b>Trust in the expert hunters never feels misplaced</b>, even when they recommend the party break into passionate song. For singing the shanty 'Cheerly-ay-oh' brings the crew together, whilst also dispersing the wary bears deep into the forest.","800613":"<b>The hunters lack guile.</b> They have enough to lead the crew on a route silent as a church, but not enough to stop a bear sniffing them out. It's easy to believe from its vacant eyes, that it sees you as a potentially delicious kind of threat.","800614":"<b>Call themselves hunters!</b> The tracks thought to lead away from bear territory go instead to a clearing at its heart. The bears at first seem alarmed their picnic is disturbed, until they realise your crew are on the menu. The sound of crunching bone rings in the ears of the few that manage to flee.","800615":"Attack the bear","800616":"Outmanoeuvre the bear","800617":"<b>The bear's face proves a good target.</b> Ducking the terrifying whooshes of its paws, someone manages to prime their pistol and shoot it through the eye. The bear drops dead. No-one feels particularly good about killing it, but the way ahead is now clear.","800618":"<b>Adaptation is good when a fight isn't going well.</b> The bear flinches but does not drop after the first round of gunfire. There is no time to reload, before it is upon them with its paws. Knocked down the men are smart enough to play dead. After an hour or so facing the floor, the bears lose interest and leave. The crew are able to lick their wounds, and move on.","800619":"<b>It's easy to underestimate mummy bears.</b> As the soldiers fluff the loading of their weapons, the bear nonchalantly grasps one by the wrist, and sinks her jaw into his neck. The others panic and flee with their arms in the air. She pursues a second, striking him dead against a rock. Now she and her cubs can finally be left in peace.","800620":"<b>Sometimes it helps to know your hill contours.</b> The crew carefully fall away, circumventing the bear's position, and keeping their backs to the mountainside. With the higher ground, the bear appears to lose interest. Hearts pumping, the crew hurry to safety.","800621":"<b>Stupidly the crew decide to run, and reach a dead-end.</b> The bear pursues at a leisurely speed, yet with no less menace, and the crew are forced to seek refuge in a cave, or else try climbing the trees.","800623":"Hide in the cave and pray","800624":"Climb the trees","800625":"<b>Against all anxiety, the Bear doesn't follow.</b> Still, the men in the cave are too afraid to light a fire, or sleep through the night. Shattered and hungry, they emerge the next morning, only to find their sacrifice was wholly unnecessary.","800626":"<b>Bears can see terribly well in the dark</b>, and since your crew have stumbled into its house, where its vulnerable infants sleep, it is not very happy. The crew that do manage to break for daylight have clothes ragged and torn, and cannot speak, for it is clear they were the lucky ones.","800627":"<b>The crew climb the trees well enough</b>, but the bear isn't going to make their lives easy. It is a full day and night before it gives up shaking trunks, or climbing halfway up towards the dangling crew. When it finally leaves, the exhausted crew descend, their nerves in shreds.","800628":"<b>Bears are awfully good at climbing trees</b>, and as on this occasion, it is not uncommon to see them strike their adversaries from the branches. Its hapless victim plunges from the canopy and lands like a sack of red berries on rocks below. Others injure themselves as the men drop from the trees in a desperate escape.","800629":"<b>The lone bear's haunch is picked out with expert marksmanship.</b> It staggers before bounding off into the woods. Your crew are delighted to return to the safety of the ship, whilst also having done the mighty beast no lasting harm.","800630":"<b>The first volley of shots miss</b>, and the bear attacks. A second shot finds its mark, and the wounded bear escapes into the trees, but a man lies dead. His brother cries revenge, and is already off into the woods to hunt the grisly killer.","800631":"<b>Out here, bears rule.</b> The wildly inaccurate gunfire  serves only to rile the bear into a frenzy, and draw attention to your position. Then a second, larger bear thunders from the undergrowth and mauls a man to death. A few of your piffling soldiery manage to escape with all their limbs attached.","800632":"Track the wounded bear with him","800633":"Leave the fool behind","800634":"<b>Bittersweet.</b> Your fine tracking skills allow the crew to catch up with the bear and watch it from hiding. It is a she-bear, and is now nuzzling its young cubs. 'That is why she killed him,' says the brother, gone all vitriol. 'Let us leave, and hope my brother's spirit may somehow live on in this place.'","800635":"<b>The hot-headed hunt is a success none celebrate.</b> Once found, the bear no longer has strength to defend itself. As the brother drives a stake into its heart, it gives over with a last sad sigh. In that moment a tiny cub pads into the open, crawling weakly under the limp arm of its mother. If only they had understood, the crew could have saved the heartache.","800636":"<b>Hunting is impossible with passions running this high.</b> When another man snaps a twig, the vengeful brother attacks him wildly, and the others fail to intervene. The brother's eyes glaze as he slides to the earth, bayonet in his back.","800637":"<b>The decision is unpopular.</b> 'Stubborn 'til the end,' say those in the minority. But the greater part have things to say on the subject of dishonour. 'Those brothers loved each other to the end,' remarks one old sailor, 'and what little love did we show for them...'","800638":"<b>The bears have no chance.</b> Indeed, the camouflage is so good, the crew can barely see one another! Thickly daubed in the colours of the forest, the chameleon crew bypass the bears with ease. A story of ingenuity at which their grandchildren shall marvel!","800639":"<b>Even the most hardened sailors find the smell unbearable.</b> Not to mention the indignity of covering oneself in bear excrement for longer than is perfectly necessary. Eventually though the bears depart, leaving the reeking crew free to have a much-needed wash.","800640":"<b>Dressing as pantomime trees is a bad idea</b>, and as the bears attack, the flimsy branches the crew intended to cover their faces prove no more effective in self-defence. The ensuing scene might have made for an impressive spectacle on the stage, though only as the most gruesome of tragedies.","800658":"The locals look expectant.","800659":"Deal","800660":"No Deal","800663":"The Seven-Year Itch","800664":"<b>The crew are beset by insatiable and painful itching!</b> From lieutenants down to pigeon-keepers, they twist and turn in their bunks and cannot sleep. It is affecting their capacity to carry out the most basic duties, something must be done!","800665":"Wash more often!","800666":"Analyse the symptoms","800667":"Find somewhere to stop and be rid of it","800668":"Let them itch, it's common at sea","800669":"<b>Washing a splendid idea at sea? Who knew?!</b> The itching is very soon forgotten, as the sailors cavort through rainbows of expurgating bubbles. The rich perfume below deck is a welcome reminder of family and bygone days.","800670":"<b>'Only jellyfish!' says the cultivated doctor cheerfully.</b> 'Our refreshing swim at that cove appears to be the cause. It must have been rife with their larvae!' The crew marvel at the clever diagnosis, and as the itching subsides, bask in the pioneering case-study they have performed for the benefit of humankind.","800671":"<b>The red welts seem to perplex the doctor.</b> 'There is evidence of the parasitic,' he splutters as he peers through his magnifying glass, 'but then it could be nothing at all!'","800672":"<b>The doctor is a demented quack.</b> When the condition is established correctly as crusted scabies - contagious, but hardly dangerous - the doctor's experiment is for the affected to bathe in an acid solution. Needless to say, his victims do not survive their injuries. When the expedition returns, it is entirely possible he may be stripped of his profession.","800673":"Examine the cabins for some sort of parasite","800674":"Have the afflicted bathe in holy water","800675":"<b>There are bedbugs everywhere!</b> There must be something that can be done to exterminate these disc-bodied hangers-on!","800676":"<b>They cannot see the wood for the trees!</b> Evidence of fleas would be everywhere to the right pair of eyes. Two weeks pass, and murine typhus breaks out. Rashes, fever and vomiting grip the fleas' hosts, who are never able to find the cause of their itching agony.","800677":"Refurbish the cabins","800678":"Simply change the sheets","800679":"<b>The matter is craftily 'put-to-bed'.</b> Despite the time-consuming upheaval, the crew are surprised to have their cabins so well refurbished. 'They're too soft on us,' says a jolly cove inspecting the new bunks, but my britches haven't itched all day.'","800680":"<b>What dreary decor!'</b> says the Lieutenant tartly. Matters deteriorate when some ill-fashioned bunks collapse. 'I'd rather have the itching back,' says an exhausted-looking sailor. Like others, he has to sleep out on the hard decking, until some competent craftsmen can come aboard.","800681":"<b>It is a job half-done.</b> For most the problem goes away, but  some must live with the itching. Wherever the bugs' nasty little hidey-hole is, it must still reel with lousy punters, each telling stories of the sailor blood they drained the night before.","800682":"<b>The priest's most divine bottle does the trick.</b> 'This water is indeed holy!' he says, as the fearsome muscovite vodka from 1791 is uncorked and slapped over the itches of the queuing sailors. 'Shame to use it like this, but I'd rather sleep,' he cackles.","800683":"<b>'Is nothing sacred anymore?'</b> Says the priest, who turns up his nose at the suggestion of using his water for something so humdrum. 'The lord hath bigger fish to fry,' he says pointedly. As well as the vile and incessant itching, the crew now have a parsimonious priest to contend with.","800684":"<b>Sand and sun is a panacea!</b> An acute sense of direction leads the ship to an island paradise. A freshwater lagoon relieves the itching, and the much-needed relaxation will stand all in good stead for the journey ahead.","800685":"<b>Bringing contagion to port might be a bad idea.</b> The itching is at its worst by the time the expedition reaches the bustling alien seaport, something the local authorities don't fail to notice. The harbour-master's tug escorts you to quarantine. How do you escape?","800686":"<b>It's impossible for your aimless navigators to concentrate.</b> The expedition fidgets wildly off course, with no land in sight. Meanwhile the assassin bugs continue to spread their dreadful disease. Even they'd probably make better navigators! Then there wouldn't have to be quite so much death!","800687":"Lie that the sickness isn't contagious","800688":"Threaten them into letting you go","800689":"Await quarantine","800690":"<b>The lie works like a charm.</b> A doctor promptly comes aboard to confirm this hypothesis. Although she sternly points out the condition is contagious after all, she also recognises it to be a mild complaint. 'Crabs,' the translator says, face flushing. The crew are too relieved to feel embarrassed.","800692":"<b>It is obvious you are lying,</b> and the authorities are not impressed. They allow several days to pass, without any word on your ship's release, adversely affecting the morale of your crew.","800693":"<b>They don't want any trouble.</b> A doctor comes aboard ship and goes nervously about his business. Although the atmosphere is somewhat cagey, medicines for your crew's skin conditions are provided, and the expedition can continue on its way.","800694":"<b>You underestimate them.</b> Two surprise warships hove round the landspit and close in to firing range. There is no choice but to run. As your ship crashes wildly out between jetties, the escort ship pincers, and opens fire. The effect is catastrophic. Your modest vessel flees in tatters, and many good sailors are dead or wounded. For the rest, the itching is set to continue.","800695":"<b>It's a long time before the authorities deal with you,</b> with bureaucracy seemingly a way of life here. When you finally have access to a medical professional, there is already a post-mortem to be conducted. It appears chemicals leeched into the water supply and caused the rashes and sickness. With the water changed, the others recover, but it cannot redeem the loss of a life.","800696":"<b>It is a particularly awful itch however.</b> The disgusting lice infesting the ship, and discomfort thereof has many questioning the worth of your expedition. There is only so much scratching a crew can take before they lose all appetite for the journey ahead.","800698":"<b>Widespread suspicion is the undesirable outcome.</b> Ignorance of the full circumstances surrounding the death has the crew feeling powerless.

'Why not an X?' says the captain with an air of disappointment. 'Sarmento!' says Ramón, his eyes sparkling with life, 'She is the key to everything.

'Guerrilla tubes,' says the captain with a sage nod. They match the map, leading to a promising cleft in rock. Could this be the domain of the elusive Sarmento?!

Indeed, so diverting is this new form of alcohol absorption, that even those without parasites take turns.","800882":"<b>The doctor concocts a panacea</b>, which not only purges the belly-dwelling roundworm, but more besides. Garlic, wormwood, and lemon quietly see off a myriad other complaints of your spoon-dodging sailors.","800883":"<b>The doctors disagree.</b> 'Madam! Bloodletting gives our patients only a fifty-fifty chance!' says one. 'Sir, tinctures are seldom beneficial OR effective on parasites!' says the other.","800884":"<b>It does go away, eventually.</b> 'My arm looked like a wormcake for a while,' one sailor laments, 'but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war.'","800885":"<b>Mass amputation for all?!</b> The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone!

The doctor freely admits this is more likely down to positive patient attitude, than his revolting tincture.","800890":"<b>The unpleasant medicine doesn't help.</b> Constant trips to the privy are now the only release for your bug-ridden crew. The doctor admits to the failure of the tincture, but thankfully has something for diarrhoea.","800891":"The tincture is poison! Having seen their first shipmate choke on his dose, the rest decide they'd rather live with a six-foot tapeworm in their bellies.","800892":"<b>Somehow it works</b>, and the patients are rid of the parasite. The doctor seems unsurprised, 'human physiology may be complex, but treatment need not be.' A pretty vague case summary, but who cares?!","800893":"<b>Perfect preparation for amputation!</b> At least that's what your crazed doctor would have you believe. Once her macabre experiment is concluded there is surely only one course of action for the afflicted...the crew are aghast.","800894":"<b>It does go away, eventually.</b> 'My arm looked like a wormcake for a while,' one sailor laments, 'but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war.'","800895":"<b>Mass amputation for all?!</b> The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone!

The crew look not nearly as enthusiastic as you might think however.","800902":"<b>Extraordinary that you trusted that quack!</b> She is sideshow surgeon, carving up her victims with the zeal of a ripper, and the accuracy of a pissing schoolboy. At least the screams will die away soon enough...","800903":"<b>Nothing can save them.</b> Though a mercy that they may choose their manner of death - unmolested by the ship's quack - it is death nonetheless. The parasite has sucked the life from your expedition.","800932":"The Icy Blizzard","800933":"<b>Trapped in the snow!</b> When the furious blizzard relents, the exploration party see the mountain pass ahead is blocked. Some say the rough terrain can be crossed, others say they saw a small fork in the path not too far back.","800934":"Blow up the freeze ahead.","800935":"Craft something to traverse the terrain","800936":"Take the fork you passed","800937":"Await help","800938":"<b>The crew feel happy awe</b>, at the resulting avalanche. There, as the pass beyond is revealed, they swear they see something lurching away. Giant and hirsute, it leaves no print but in the imagination.","800939":"<b>The skis are highly effective.</b> Simply fashioned, and with a clever coating of paraffin. Some prove expert skiers, glissading with a flourish to the finish line, but all make it to the bottom. The whole thing has turned out to be a good bit of fun.","800943":"<b>It is not much of a detour.</b> The going is steady and before long the warm fire of the base camp appears in view. The blizzard is something to tell the grandchildren, provided frostbite hasn't seen to that...","800944":"<b>The path is both steep and perilous.</b> A narrow ledge along a sheer cliff lies ahead. Some men are ready to give up. All the while a strange noise keens below the gnashing gale.","800945":"<b>A far more treacherous path</b>, but your crew are committed now. A steep cliff ahead must be negotiated, and your ropes are too short.","800946":"<b>Shelter is minimal.</b> Huddling cannot keep out the cold. When a rescue party arrives with equipment the next morning, they find men frostbitten and hypothermic. Not all of them will survive the journey down.","800947":"<b>Toboggans are better where it's flat.</b> Though solidly made, the going is fast. One sled veers into a ravine. A cry below: 'Officer injured', but the wind is picking up.","800948":"<b>The clumsy snowshoes fail you.</b> Whether it is in their design or construction, every step sinks the party deeper. The cold will claim lives before the storm is weathered.","800949":"Descend and help the officer","800951":"Hope they manage alone","800952":"<b>The doctor works quickly.</b> Just what is needed with another blizzard brewing. 'Temporary strapping,' he says, 'but should get us home.' The officer and rest of the party make shelter with little time left to spare.","800953":"<b>The doctor knows nothing of urgency.</b> 'Give my patient space!' he snaps at those trying to move things along. Meanwhile, a blizzard sweeps the ravine, and the onset of frostbite is enough to split the party. Neither the doctor nor his unfortunate patient are to be seen again.","800954":"<b>You knew deep down not all would make it.</b> 'They're all returned but the injured fellow,' comes the news. 'There was no saving him, the way he was. Ice stripped the meat from his bones like a chef's mandorre.'","800955":"Follow the divine voice","800956":"Urge your party to face their fears","800957":"<b>A heavenly, enlightened voice calls.</b> None stop to look down, so enchanted are they. Over a verge, appears a shrine with a great bell - the source of the sound - and beyond, a pilgrims' path to the foot of the mountain.","800958":"<b>A non-believer falls to his death.</b> 'Those lacking conviction shall be tried and judged in this place,' echoes the priest. The rest edge to safety, consoled by the apparent goodness in their hearts.","800960":"<b>Nothing but a demonic howl.</b> The blizzard rises anew. Without hope to keep them aloft, it is no surprise when a ledge gives way, damning to hell below.","800961":"<b>A song of solidarity rises through the line of snow-crusted faces.</b> Clinging to what they most cherish, they edge to safety. Had they not been reminded of such incentives, it is doubtful they would have survived.","800962":"<b>Only some take strength.</b> The rest remain in a frozen huddle. They may have lacked courage to negotiate the high ledge, but will welcome in their icy death with creditable stoicism.","800964":"Free climb","800965":"Craft longer ropes and swing down","800966":"<b>All are saved, at a cost.</b> Putting the ropes together is quite a task with frozen fingers. That the party are able to cling to the rope as they descend is a small miracle. Nevertheless, frostbite will do lasting damage to their digits.","800967":"<b>A small but critical detail is overlooked.</b> Grip. A man falls from the top of the rope with a cry, tumbling those below him into the abyss like meat from a skewer. Only a few frozen grimaces survive.","800968":"<b>It is a risky business.</b> Though the cliff isn't lacking in handholds, this is a test of individual endurance. Some were never going to be up to it. As they fall, the will to survive in the others strengthens.","800972":"Baptism of Fire","800973":"<b>Everything points towards the foreboding gate.</b> Salvation lies beyond, but the eerie blue flame that suffuses it keep the crew at a distance. Perhaps it would be safer to find a way through the surrounding jungle, but those of faith say the gate is 'an auspicious sign'.","800974":"Have the scientist look at the gate","800975":"Have faith and leap through the flames.","800976":"Wrap up before leaping through the flames.","800977":"Cut through the jungle instead","800978":"<b>The scientist banishes the illusion.</b> 'This fire that you perceive around the gate, is simply the agglomeration of azure glow-worms.' Laughter becomes delight, as the party take the pulsing creatures in hand. This is the wonder of nature.","800979":"<b>If anything the flames are cool</b>, almost like bundles of ribbons brushing the skin. This gate is, without question, an earthly manifestation of the divine. Ahead, an extremely hospitable settlement affirms the holy blessing.","800980":"<b>The doubtful crew are surprised.</b> Drawing closer to the gate, they find the flames seem to give off no heat. One leap of faith and they are through! Still they hesitate, for a perfect skeleton sits propped against it.","800981":"<b>Fire and brimstone!</b> The heat is intense, but your procession of false prophets seem numb to the pain. The others watch horrified, as fabric, skin and flesh renders before their eyes. If the expedition continues, it will only be for the mercy of god.","800982":"Determine how the person died","800983":"Order them to charge through!","800984":"<b>The doctor forms a reasonable hypothesis</b>, but cannot be absolutely sure from bone alone. 'The way they sit suggests they lacked the will to continue.' Not wishing to end the same way, the crew are astonished to discover that leaping through the gate does them no harm.","800985":"<b>The doctor's career is over.</b> As are the careers of those who heed his words. 'Came through from the other side, but it was not the fire that took him'. As they jump, flames grasp their ankles, and rapidly shoot up and over the rest.","800986":"<b>'Ouch!'</b> The men yelp, rolling in the dirt until they are sure they are no longer afire. The strange arch behind them, your brave soldiers compare their battle scars.","800987":"<b>'Cowards!'</b> Your men lack the military discipline to follow a simple order! You will have to find another way.","800988":"<b>They make it.</b> Rolled-up like carpets they skip through the flaming gate. Their worst complaint is the sweet and overwhelming pong of sweat that now follows them.","800989":"<b>'That they died as sausages!</b> or what shall we tell their families!?' Perhaps dousing their mantles in a protective layer of paraffin was a mistake! Your expedition continues to turn on its spit.","800990":"<b>The crew have no regrets</b> in plotting such a rational course. Sweaty jungles are the devil they know, crawling with tentacle limb and spider fang. But who knew what sorcery governed that strange gate?","800991":"<b>The jungle thins out to a precipice.</b> A long and shoddy-looking bridge stretches to the other side, or else you could attempt to find a way around.","800992":"<b>No way through,</b> thanks to your shambolic mapreading. The group becomes separated, and eventually lost. Hacking those ancient and contorted roots has saved no time that couldn't be saved by backtrack, and cost you several lives into the bargain.","800993":"Inspect the bridge","800994":"Circumnavigate the cliff","800995":"<b>It is in passable condition.</b> There are a few nerve-wracking moments, as the wind whips the bridge into a vigorous sway, and all are rather pleased to reach the other side. Your expedition continues.","800996":"<b>Most treacherous!</b> The confidence of your craftsmen in the rickety structure couldn't be more misplaced. Of course it is nothing if not dramatic, when the bridge cables twang, and one after the other pile into the gorge.","800997":"<b>It is a long trek</b>, that could have been much longer but for the competence of those with a compass. Yet another hiccup for the expedition log book.","800998":"<b>Imbecile orienteers!</b> There is no other way across this river valley for a hundred miles! You have covered half that distance before you realise, wasting a lot of time and provisions.","801001":"Mysterious Artefacts","801002":"<b>The discovery of several strange artefacts aboard spooks the crew.</b> Tied to the rigging, bunks, boards, and even atop the captain's desk. A warning, a threat? And who put them there? Since the nearby island is uninhabited, it is sensible only to think the perpetrator must be aboard. The crew must know or have seen something last night!","801003":"Ask the anthropologist","801004":"Ask the crew who did this","801005":"Throw them overboard and move on.","801006":"<b>'For good luck,'</b> remarks the anthropologist, inspecting the spherical red dolls, 'for the setting of goals, and perseverance in achieving them. Some people or spirit of this place believe they can help us home.' At this, your crew are beguiled.","801007":"<b>Your crew are beginning to bond.</b> Someone comes forward, not having expected to cause such a bother. 'They're for me old mum,' he sighs, 'birds - that one's a little robin. Made 'em together when she was ill. Now she's gone...I...' The others are quick to put an arm round his shoulder; they're all in this together.","801008":"<b>No one has anything to offer but the priest.</b> It is his belief that some unholy chapter has opened. The next morning, more of the eerie things have appeared. 'Cleanse the idols in holy fire!' he shrieks. 'Nonsense,' says a soldier. \"Set guards within, and we shall have this rat.\"","801009":"<b>A destructive episode.</b> No one has information, or perhaps they withhold it. Consensus tends towards the latter. Someone wants this expedition to fail, and these effigies are a threat. Paranoia festers. At the next port, a large part of the crew opts to quit.","801010":"<b>Chilling.</b> As instructed, the crew collect the dolls and throw them overboard. But relief lasts only until the following morning, when the dolls are found returned, placed exactly as they had been.","801011":"Side with the priest and prepare a holy fire","801012":"Keep guard and capture the perpetrator","801013":"<b>The priest gloats over his success.</b> With a maniacal grin, he sets the mound of idols alight. The fire consumes rapidly, shifting vermillion to viridian. Some say they hear the wood scream as it goes. 'Expurgation is God's work, and I am chosen.'","801014":"<b>The fire is chaotic</b>, and the buckets of water seem not to extinguish, but provoke. The flame leaps to the priest's cassock like spring-heeled jack, and as it sweeps up his back, he is heard to utter his last words, 'forgive me father, for I have sinned.'","801015":"<b>The teenagers are remorseful.</b> 'It was a jape, a piece o' trickery sirs, we regret t'were not received so.' The crew are forgiving - the youths merely wished to contain their homesickness - and call for just fifty strokes of the birch per bottom.","801016":"<b>That night, dire musket-shot is heard.</b> A dead boy on deck, local. A second is seen diving to blue. Next morning a rhythm comes from an armada of river boats, armed with guns. There island is inhabited, and they know what you have done.","801017":"<b>The sun is solemn that morning.</b> The bodies of the dead guards are borne to the hold for burial, but not here, upon this cursed rock. Who killed them none know but the sinister effigies. The expedition fumbles on.","801018":"Engage in battle.","801019":"Leave immediately.","801020":"<b>One warning salvo is enough.</b> The river boats cluster and slow. Though they lower their weapons and allow you to leave, the anger that your crime  goes unpunished couldn't be more marked in their faces.","801021":"<b>Your ship is a sitting duck.</b> Your crew cannot man stations fast enough to fire or manoeuvre. Enemy boats surround your ship, before scaling its sides. The blood shed on both sides will stain this ship and expedition forever.","801022":"<b>Once your ship is underway she is free.</b> Nevertheless your adversaries are excellent shots, and do damage to the sails and aft. The crew will have to make repairs in the days that follow.","801023":"<b>A traumatic escape.</b> In the hurry to leave, your ship is spun broadside and exposed to gunfire. There are injuries, but none so deep as the sight of the dead boy's accomplice below. He weeps, and clutches one of the idols - a good luck charm.","801025":"Dockyard Dupe","801026":"<b>Robbed!</b> Thanking the generous innkeeper, your ship is ready to leave. Everyone at the dock smiles and waves you off, and no wonder, valuable equipment is later discovered to be missing. You must decide now if it's worth going back for.","801027":"Have the detective investigate","801028":"Return and plunder the Harbour","801029":"Return disguised and bait the robbers","801030":"Ask the local authorities to take action","801031":"Take the loss on the chin","801032":"<b>The detective already knows.</b> 'I was waiting to see if our crew were complicit, but am satisfied they are not.' Your ship returns and lays a watertight case before the local authorities. With the guilty arrested your equipment is returned and your ship fully resupplied gratis.","801033":"<b>Swift justice.</b> Petty defences crumble in the dawn light. Your ship yawns unopposed into the smouldering harbour, and turns its guns upon the harbourmaster's office. 'Please, take anything!' he yelps.","801034":"<b>Your assault is too slow.</b> As you gain the upper hand over the harbour defences, the cavalry appear. Cannons pop from the west; local authorities come as reinforcement.","801035":"<b>An absolute shambles.</b> Couldn't even best a few locals and their primitive demi-cannon. 'What shall defeat us next?' yelp those who are not killed by the blast, 'A small, but angry gang of tortoises?'","801036":"Fight them all","801037":"<b>You put an end to corruption!</b> Brought to their knees, the local authorities admit a conspiracy in which all are involved. 'It was never meant to go this far. We vow our people shall never rob again!' Proud to have effected change, you take back your possessions and leave.","801038":"<b>The enemy force is vast.</b> 'How many are there, captain!? We must turn back.' But it is too late. Soon it is not just the western cliff lit up with cannonfire, but your ship. Many lives will be lost before you crawl out of range.","801039":"Make peace, and reason with the officials.","801040":"<b>They are wiling to listen.</b> After an exasperating few days, you are finally able to prove your losses. The authorities take in the guilty dockers, and most, but not all of your possessions are returned.","801041":"<b>The authorities stand with their own.</b> You put your case as best you can, but it's not enough. Furthermore, you must answer for the damage you've caused. Unfortunately, this means leaving one of your best behind to help with repairs.","801042":"<b>You rumble the schemers!</b> The crew set aside superstition, daubing your ship a new name. Cut-throat sailors pose as officers, with cabin curtains repurposed as sashes to mark them strangely. Taken in by it all, the innkeeper and his dockside associates are caught in the act. You make sure to relieve them of far more than they stole.","801043":"<b>It works, at first.</b> A lick of paint, and the ship differs enough to blend in at the busy port. Moustaches and clothes aren't enough for the crafty innkeeper though. 'Thought you could fool us?' he scoffs.","801044":"<b>With feeble disguises</b>, your party can't believe the inn doesn't out them. But then there's laughter, as patrons turn in unison, guns held to your heads. 'Better hope its not cold where you go!' the innkeeper says. Your crew are stripped, bound, and packed off to sea.","801045":"Take back what is yours by force","801046":"Threaten to expose their scheme","801047":"<b>Sometimes a fistfight is the only way.</b> The inn is a hurricane of chair and glass, as your crew express themselves the only way they know how. Once the locals are subdued, the innkeeper is dragged outside, his life now security against whatever plunder you please.","801048":"<b>The locals are brutal.</b> Home-made knuckles, knives and cudgels scrape open the faces of your crew. Some are to bleed out on the sticky hostelry floor, the bloody remainder, to be packed off by the authorities for disturbance of the peace.","801049":"<b>The innkeeper relents.</b> 'We've got a good thing going here, and I don't want you spoiling it,' he sniffs, 'take what's yours and leave.' The crew have back what they lost, but thoughts are spared for the scheme's next unwary victims.","801050":"<b>'Get out, before we scratch you out!'</b> growls the innkeeper, true colours plain. It seems the whole port is on his side. The expedition must take the loss of time and equipment on the chin.","801051":"<b>You make the case well.</b> 'You are quite right. Terrible corruption such as this must be put to an end!' says the governor, 'you shall have back what was taken.' His disingenuousness stinks to high heaven, but there's no time for deeper digging.","801052":"<b>They are corrupt.</b> 'What a fantastical story. I am so glad our country has fired your imagination!' smiles the governor.","801053":"Risk implicating the governor","801054":"Resort to violence","801055":"<b>'Clever. Very clever.'</b> He lights a cigar. 'How did you know the innkeeper was my brother?' Your emissary sensibly avoids the truth that it was guesswork. 'Take whatever you want,' he says gesturing to a warehouse bursting with seized goods.","801056":"<b>'That was your last mistake,'</b> chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest these fops!' Your delegation try to resist, but they are armed only with the toothpicks that came with their canapes. Your expedition must manage without them.","801057":"<b>'Alright, alright!'</b> says the amused governor, bayonet to his neck, 'take what you want. But then you leave.' Since the harbour is now well-guarded, you've done well to force a compromise.","801058":"<b>'That was a mistake,'</b> chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest them!' Your crew would rather die than be locked-up for life, so they fight their way out. At least, one or two of them do.","801059":"Give up and leave","801060":"<b>Widespread frustration among the crew.</b> 'The instruments were vital for my research!', 'You let those beggars off scot free?!', 'This expedition is an embarrassment!' Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.","801061":"<b>Widespread frustration among the crew.</b> 'The instruments were vital for my research!', 'You let those beggars off scot free?!', 'This expedition is an embarrassment!' Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.","801063":"The Arid Basin","801064":"<b>Water has dribbled almost to nothing during an inland survey</b>, en route to the rendezvous. But hope springs eternal! A muddy river strikes through the arid basin. The crew are delirious when they realise it is not completely dried-up. Do you stop for water, or press on?","801065":"Trust the Botanist's expertise.","801066":"Fashion a device to extract water from mud.","801067":"Look for the source of the river","801068":"Press on to the rendezvous","801069":"<b>The botanist foams at the mouth with thirst-quenching theories.</b> 'The best idea may be these trees. Cut them just here, and catch the drip of water beneath,' they say, as they take a knife to the bark. Before an hour has passed, there's enough water to soothe a beached humpback.","801070":"<b>'The secret is boiling the water'</b>, says one resourceful survivalist, 'and needless to say a mixture of charcoal, sand and cloth makes a fine filter.' With water drawn, filtered and boiled, the crew can be sure it is safe to drink. Time even for a mud bath - your safari brigade slopping about like happy hippo.","801071":"<b>The water still has a mighty pong</b>, despite all solids having been separated out by the rudimentary device. Several feel terribly ill after drinking. A treatment can be improvised, or the survey can try to hold out until the rendezvous.","801072":"<b>Hours under hot sun, for fatally little.</b> Countless designs in the soil, and no prototype. When something is finally cobbled together, the fools test their stupid sieve with the last of the clean supply. It will be a miracle now if anyone survives.","801073":"<b>Finding a river source is easy</b>, but turning it into a shortcut...? That takes brains. High above the dry basin, water piles blissfully into the gully. The men wouldn't miss a swim beneath a waterfall for the world!","801074":"<b>There's water, if you can get to it.</b> Hippos are gathered all along the bank. This is their territory. If you don't refill here, there's no guarantee you'll find water further on.","801075":"<b>Following a river should have been easy.</b> But your party are so focused on distant goals, they fail to look immediately ahead. Suddenly, a man shoots downward as if yanked by giant hands. There are holes everywhere - an underground system of caves, and a tomb for your unlucky crew.","801076":"<b>There was never enough water for all of them.</b> A freak mist has the crew licking air with cracked tongues, but nothing can keep the wolf from the door. Several drop dead as old bone, before the safari staggers to the rendezvous camp.","801077":"Improvise a treatment","801078":"Hurry to the rendezvous","801079":"<b>The sickness clears over time.</b> 'With dysentery the patient must rest,' the sensible doctor said, 'away from the others.' With the last of the good water, and gentle nursing, the caravan reaches the rendezvous in fair health.","801080":"<b>No-one is ready for dysentery.</b> The sick are empty and weak, no fluids to replenish all they have lost. With only vague measures in place to prevent the spread, savannah delirium reigns. The survey never reaches the rendezvous.","801081":"<b>Haste saves some, but not all.</b> Dysentery is thoroughly set in by the time the survey makes the rendezvous. Although the camp provides the sick every comfort, for many the rigours of the sickness prove too much.","801082":"Scare the hippos away","801083":"Approach the water cautiously","801084":"Shoot at the hippos","801085":"Wait for nightfall, hoping they leave","801087":"<b>Hip hip hooray!</b> The hippos run as fast as their stout legs will carry them. The serenity of the river bank is utterly destroyed, but none of your crew care, as they help themselves to bucketfuls of clean and highly quaffable drinking water.","801088":"<b>Someone knows their hippopotami.</b> A kinship with the animals allows the gentle river bank to be shared. Fresh water is relayed by the bucket. A few nervous moments as a large female rears out of the water, but she just wants a bird to pick her teeth. Satisfied, the crew resume their trek to the rendezvous.","801089":"<b>There's movement in the hippo camp</b>, as the crew approach, followed by violent evacuations of their gigantic nostrils. Mandolin jaws open wide in display, and it is pretty clear to the crew they have no choice but to back off.","801090":"<b>A game of unhappy hippos ensues!</b> The water swirls with their pudgy bodies. They snort and scream, and prepare to charge.","801091":"Fire at the charging hippo","801092":"Immediately run away and leave the area entirely","801093":"<b>Cold, but effective.</b> The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead. The other hippos falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink.","801094":"<b>The hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.</b> One is dead on impact. Others die slow, trampled or drowning, matchstick guns floating downriver like poohsticks. There's almost no-one left to make the rendezvous.","801095":"<b>Escape is more panic than anything else</b>, but the crew are spooked. Lurching through the water with hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again.","801096":"<b>Aquatic combat is a key discipline.</b> What small guilt the crew feel about driving the poor hippos from their patch is overcome by a will to survive. Out here, it is such ruthlessness that separates the living from the dead.","801097":"<b>What shot hits, barely passes through blubber.</b> The whole bloat of hippos charge, leaving them an instant to make a decision.","801098":"Fire at the hippos","801099":"Run","801100":"<b>Cold, but effective.</b> The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead. The other hippo falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink.","801101":"<b>The hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.</b> One is dead on impact.

Lurching through the water with hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again.","801103":"<b>Hardly seems worth waiting for.</b> The hippos wallow all evening, leaving only as night falls to graze. The crew have lost half a day's march on the rendezvous, for a bit of muddy water.","801104":"<b>A waste of time.</b> The hippos leave at dusk to graze. Unfortunately, their patch is just a stone's throw away. Their aqueous eyes can be seen glistening in the moonlight, and no-one wants to risk it.","801580":"You have found a radiant relic! The crew toast the success of your archaeological expedition. May we now better understand what it is to be human!","801587":"Sunken Depths","801588":"<b>Unusual debris float among the waves.</b> Mold-ridden planks of wood, strings of cloth, fragments of broken plaster, all tinted by the gray shade of time. Filled with childish excitation, the crew discusses the possibility of going underwater to uncover the debris' origin.","801589":"Send your diver into the depths","801590":"Improvise a diving bell","801591":"Ignore the beckoning junk","801592":"<b>The diver plunges into the ocean with fish-like ease.</b> He follows the trail of debris through the murky waters and almost smacks into a wall of indescribable height. Unsure whether the obstacle is natural or man-made, the diver wanders along its smooth facade until he finds an uncanny artefact and resurfaces with it. His account of the underwater mystery fascinates the crew.","801593":"<b>The diving bell looks decent and feels solid.</b> Two men climb aboard and the bell plunges into the depths while a whole group of sailors pumps air into its ventilation tube. The bell descends until it is stopped by a surface of coral. Underneath the colorful shapes, the sailors notice a silver coin on their left and a gaping, perfectly circular hole on their right.","801594":"<b>The homemade diving bell falls apart.</b> The engineers, specialized in complex ship machinery, have no idea on how to make such a simple device. Their machine departs with two men onboard, and they continue to dive while the bell itself stays afloat. When the divers emerge, the engineers take an earful and the crew is too disheartened to make a new attempt.","801595":"Hope that it will resist the dive and push the bell into the hole","801596":"Pick up the coin and resurface","801597":"<b>Their trust in the work of their comrades pays.</b> The bell slithers in a slow fall which allows the bewitched divers to take in the view. This is no sunken ship: the engraved hole was a window among a hundred more lining a hall of ridiculous proportions. A single ray of light, pouring from the hole, accompanies the bell's descent until it lands on what might have been statue alcoves. A shining green pearl lies in the lowest part of the alcove.","801598":"<b>The bell doesn't resist the fall.</b> Instead of gliding along the sides of the hole, the bell tilts, letting the water in. The men call for help and the crew immediately tries to pull them up, fighting against what rocks snare the bell, doing their best to save their mates, and unable to react when the rope snaps into their hands. They are left to mourn their sea-buried companions.","801599":"Ignore the pearl and risk the dive into darkness","801600":"Retrieve the pearl from the dead-end and resurface","801601":"<b>Call it luck or miracle, but the bell holds.</b> One of the men lights the bell's lamp and the other dives, following the glow as it illuminates the silent scene below: ghostly statues of hunting scenes, collapsed frescoes depicting plentiful gardens, and a massive throne of fractured marble on which a sword waits, covered in fluttering kelp. When the artifact is brought back to the surface and cleaned up, it reveals a weapon of exquisite quality, embedded with unknown jewels and metals.","801602":"<b>Lady Luck does not smile for the faithless.</b> As the bell descends into the dark, so does the pressure rise and press against the makeshift protection. The sailors pull the signal rope in a panic, but despite their fervent prayers, they are not pulled up in time. All that the crew manages to retrieve from the sea are the broken bell and its broken contents.","801603":"<b>The pearl is made of pure jade!</b> The crew marvels at it and all want to touch it, feel it, smell it. The pearl spreads a nostalgic fragrance of salt water, fresh moss and damp stones, and the sailors agree this might be the very smell of adventure.","801604":"<b>Low risk, low reward.</b> The diving bell emerges without a scratch and the crew enjoys the tiny silver coin, passing it around and commenting on its singular aspect. Their excitement can only survive for so long and the coin is stored in the officers' coffers while the sailors whisper what ifs leading to grander treasures.","801605":"<b>The sailors protest but understand the risk.</b> As the ship goes on its way, its wake drowns the singular ruins and their promise of adventure.","801607":"The Trial","801609":"<b>The crew faces the bloody customs of foreign lands.</b> After a night of feasting, the sailors believe that meeting the foreign prince and his sea-traveling court is the highlight of their trip. However, morning comes with news of a sudden death among the court, and your crew is immediately accused of murder. The prince demands a trial by combat and your men are left with little freedom but the choice of the challenge's nature.","801610":"Send your strongest fighter for a brawl","801611":"Send your best shot for a pistol duel","801612":"Send your brightest officer for a trial of wits","801613":"<b>What could a lord do against a sea-forged champion?</b> The prince's warrior is nothing more than a scarecrow in shiny armor, and your own cotton-clad fighter scoffs at his tacky opponent. The walking wardrobe is tripped, grabbed, and thrown overboard in a single movement. As per foreign laws, your crew receives compensation and their name is cleared.","801614":"<b>No word is brutal enough to describe your opponent.</b> If his plate armor is scaled to match the man inside, then that man is a giant. The human mountain reaches to grab your fighter and crushes his skull like he would an apple. Word of your crew's feebleness and alleged crimes is sent for all cities to know and spread.","801615":"<b>Your gunslinger shoots faster than his own shadow.</b> His opponent drops to the ground before anyone can see or even understand that a gun has been fired, and only the banging sound and fuming barrel testify to the attack. The prince wonders how lucky your sharpshooter is, then reluctantly graces the crew and presents them with compensation for his offence.","801616":"<b>Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.</b> The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen. Your best shot is dead before he even touches the handle of his gun. Judging his passing to be too low a price, the prince randomly selects men among your crew and has them hanged for good measure.","801617":"<b>The foreigners are drawn in by your officer's pace.</b> He inspects the body, noticing knife cuts of varying depths and bleeding. Through methodical questioning, the officer presses the foreigners and reveals the deception: each wound was made by a different hand, the victim was killed by all of them! The prince buys the sailors' silence and they leave wondering what could have motivated the curious murder.","801618":"<b>A mute would have pleaded better.</b> The officer engages in a battle of arguments with the prince's vizier, and each of his meager claims are met with factual evidence of their contrary. The prince cuts the exchange with exasperation and has the officer taken to be quartered till torn apart as a final judgement for the supposed crime. No scream ever matches the ones heard that day.","801620":"Wall of Ice","801621":"<b>The ship has hit an iceberg!</b> Navigating in the dark proved to be folly: what little lighting the ship provides for itself does not compensate for the absence of moonlight. A low thud shakes the entire boat, and the swinging lights of night lanterns reveal the rampart-like block of ice they have run into. A crevice splits the iceberg and the ship is stuck inside.","801622":"Destroy the iceberg with dynamite","801623":"Bombard the ice with all cannons","801624":"Build a device to push the ice away","801625":"Pray for help","801626":"<b>No obstacle can prevail before human might.</b> Sticks of dynamite are tied to the iceberg's flanks and lit in a perfect synchrony, exploding in a tidy and devastatingly efficient manner. Impressed by their own skill, the crew happily resumes the trip.","801627":"<b>The iceberg crumbles under the impressive firepower of the ship.</b> The port and starboard cannons are fired, denting the ice inch by inch until it breaks into pieces which fall into the water with huge splashes. The ship's iron prow pushes against the formidable obstacle and breaks through under the cheers of the crew.","801628":"<b>Those puny cannons cannot take down the wall of ice.</b> Frozen shards rain on the deck with each new cannon blast, and they cut and slice into the sailors - tiny wounds which make it seem like the iceberg is fighting back. The crevice surrounding the ship has gotten bigger, but still refuses to let it go.","801629":"Climb the iceberg to plant explosives inside","801630":"The iceberg is weakened, wait for it to melt","801631":"<b>A risky reward for a risky attempt.</b> Using what nails and planks they can hammer into the wall of ice, a group of sailors climbs it and manages to reach its top, where they plant a barrel of gunpowder. The explosion lights the night, pulverizes the wall, and nicks the ship's hull. The vessel can leave after light repairs.","801632":"<b>Climbing does not simply consist of walking upwards.</b> The men slip, slide, shift and totter, and their best effort resides in climbing on each other's shoulders to try and reach new heights. They don't, and the human ladder crashes onto the deck, leaving all of its rungs bent or definitively broken. The remaining crew must wait for the ice to melt by itself before they can leave.","801633":"<b>Days melt into weeks which melt into months.</b> With each passing moment, the ice grows a bit weaker, but constant observation makes it seem like nothing is changing. The wait drives the crew restless and their tension escalates into regular, if unjustified, brawls. When the ice finally lets them go, all sailors have gained their small share of madness.","801634":"<b>The crew assembles a perfect lever to free the ship.</b> Unbolting the decorative guardrail of the prow and roping it to the starboard railing, they manage to create a semblance of a pry bar which sneaks between the hull and the ice and pushes the latter away. The sailors row their way out to the cadence of a beloved song.","801635":"<b>There is a difference between imagining and actually creating.</b> The lever mechanism devised by the engineers is as unmanageable as it is ugly and the shape of the thing, which defies the very concept of aesthetics, is a testimony to its chaotic behaviour. The crew gives up any idea of building their own escape device.","801636":"<b>Patience and good faith reward the sailors' prayers.</b> The following day is devoid of clouds or wind and the perfect weather attracts fishing boats to deeper seas. The stuck ship is seen and rescued right away. The navigators hasten to warn their fellow seamen of the danger and are even offered a space in the prestigious Practical Pilot navigation guide. Such an accident will never happen again!","801637":"<b>Prayers take a long time to reach whoever is listening.</b> The crew waits, digging into their supplies and entertaining themselves however they can. Rescue finally comes after one full week in the form of a whaler which drags the ship out from its ice prison, and the sailors, relieved but tired, can't help but wonder if they could have made it out on their own.","801638":"<b>Nobody is answering these prayers.</b> After days of idling in the cold and gnawing through their supplies and patience, the crew's discontent rises to the extent that they cannot bear to wait any longer. If help does come, it will come from themselves.","801642":"Scylla and Charybdis","801643":"<b>Your crew attempts the crossing of a vicious strait.</b> Like Odysseus along the coasts of Sicily, they see a subsidiary current running counter to the main flow, its strength so wild it brings fish with deformed eyes and luminescent bellies to the surface. What creatures are not swallowed by this whirlpool end up impaled on the shore's nasty teeth.","801646":"Avoid the whirlpool and maneuver to dodge the shore","801647":"Avoid the shore and hope the whirlpool won't suck the ship in","801648":"<b>Odysseus didn't have the ability of your navigators.</b> Through a series of tight maneuvers and expert understanding of the furious currents, they drive the ship between the whirlpool and the shore, using the provided momentum to dash ahead. The moment is a brief as it is intense and the crew rejoices, laughing like children under the cold droplets of crashing waves.","801649":"<b>The maneuver is even more complicated than expected.</b> The ship is driven alongside the whirlpool and flirts with the shore, the racket of the water covering the orders shouted by officers. The current speeds up, inexorably pulling the ship towards the reef.","801650":"<b>Fear clouds the navigators' readings.</b> Unable to choose between several possible courses which could all end in disaster, they opt for a stunned silence and let the crew maneuver on their own. The ship crashes on the shore in an explosion of metal and wood which sends a dozen men overboard and straight into the rock fangs of the coast. It is more a wreck than a ship which escapes the deadly strait.","801651":"Spin the ship to take the damage on its flank","801652":"Bombard the shore in an attempt to slow the ship","801653":"<b>A frontal crash is avoided, but it is a crash nonetheless.</b> The whole ship protests against the unnatural movement, its rudder straining against the current and its hull complaining loudly against the maneuver until the impact silences it. The repairs are much lighter than they could have been.","801654":"<b>Your navigators cannot control the wild ship.</b> The maneuver sends it spinning and it plunges into the reef prow first. If it weren't for the metal cast protecting the vessel, the crew would have been crushed as well. The repairs, which take place both in the swirling waters and on the knife-like rocks, are excruciating.","801655":"<b>Power faces power in a risky but successful attempt.</b> All cannons are fired in the shore's direction, in a surprisingly efficient effort to slow the ship down. The ship lands on the devastated coast and the hull is barely grated by the remains of the broken stone spears.","801656":"<b>What did they expect, attacking nature itself?</b> The massive teeth of stone barely tremble under the cannon's fire, and the recoil is a futile strength against the voracious current. The rock jaw catches the ship and grinds the upper deck, sending several sailors to be served as the strait's daily food.","801657":"<b>The sailors' fright gives them wings.</b> The crew reacts to each order with unparalleled speed, too occupied to plead the heavens to think of discussing the risky manoeuvres that are asked of them. When at last the whirlpool is passed, their belief that the Almighty might have his eyes on this ship is stronger than ever.","801658":"<b>There are only so many disasters faith can prevent.</b> When they understand that the whirlpool is a monster none should face, the sailors fall to their knees to pray and beg, abandoning what meaningless impact they could have had on the ship's trajectory. Like Circe prophesied to Odysseus, the currents attack the ship, the men, and a hero.","801660":"Uncategorised","801662":"Expedition Morale Medium","801663":"Expedition Morale High","801664":"Pyrphorian Pursuit","801665":"<b>The Pyrphorians are escaping with the contract!</b> The smoke of battle has screened a small craft, that is now racing clear of the skirmish! The entire assault must have been a diversion to sneak them in and out with the papers! You and Hannah may never know the truth unless you get them back. They have quite a headstart, but you might catch them in a chase.

Go to the address.","801937":"After an hour several bottles have been consumed, many words exchanged, the crew is having a great time.

In panic, he explains that his whole group was slaugthered. He was lucky enough to escape and managed to follow the murderers until he found the Pyrphorians' hide, a big house outside the city. A crew is assembled at once to go there. <br /> The house and its grand French garden around it is seeable from the street but is surrounded by a high fence with two guards at the gate. Many guards are patrolling in the garden. Infiltrating the house won't be easy.

However while the guards clearly benefited from military training, the crew is more disorganized. The guards manage to hold them just long enough for the reinforcement to regroup before falling, defeated. When the crew opens the gates the bulk of the troop is waiting for them, ready to harvest them.

A few sailors are injured but now the road to the house is open.<br />Inside the house, which room to look for?","801955":"A good military strategy is only good when well executed. This move cost more lives than if the un properly trained sailors had fight like they usually do, bar fight style. The battle lasts long and many good men are killed before the crew manages to finally get the upper hand. The road to the house is free but they must clearly act fast to find the contract before the reinforcement come.<br />Inside the house, which room to look for?","801956":"Have the captain charge first, giving courage to all","801957":"Lord of the Ring style. The captain takes his swords and run toward the guards. The crew follows him and closes on the guards in a few seconds, as if animated by a divine push. The guards are defeated.

At the first blow on their captain the crew conviction that they represent a greater good and will therefore be protected shatters. The battle is a bloodshed like many, nothing heroic about it.

A lot of guards are passing by.","801972":"To be as effective as a shadow one must not simply need to move discretely but also pick the right path to do so. While discrete when climbing the fence, the man chose a too risky path and is forced to jump down in a grove. Many patrols are walking around him and it is now too dangerous to back track.","801973":"Kill one of the guards and take his uniform","801974":"The man is quick and strong. Without having the time to scream or gasp of surprise the guards is on the floor. The man hides him in a grove and take his uniform. He can know walk into the house unsuspiciously.<br />Inside the house, which room to look for?","801975":"Jumping on the guard as fast a possible, the man is not strong enough to knock him in one blow. The guard screams and alerts his companions. The poor man is taken, tortured to reveal the position of his fellow crew members. There is no more choice, they will need to fight.

Cracks pierce the hull where the cargo hit it, and trickles of water pop one after the other in the storage space.","802003":"Use the electric water pump to allow proper repairs","802004":"Improvise a water pump to allow immediate repairs","802005":"Seal the damaged section and repair it at the next harbour","802006":"<b>Specific solutions for specific situations: your preparation was on point.</b> The electric pump roars and swallows water much faster that it can infiltrate the ship, allowing the sailors to repair the damage with ease.","802007":"<b>Your crew's craftiness has a solution for everything.</b> Using communication tubes as the pump's body and spare metal sheets as paddles, the sailors manage to assemble what could pass for a proper water pump. A good dozen of men is needed to make it work, but they buy enough time for proper repairs.","802008":"<b>This joke of a pump looks like it came from the Dark Ages.</b> As the sailors battle to have their own idea of a pump prevail over the others, they assemble a monster that does nothing more than blow bubbles. One of the cracks bursts in a spray of water that silences the machine and starts flooding the hull.","802010":"Seal the overflowing section, regardless of what or who might still be inside","802011":"Make a decision, who knows what happens if you don't!","802012":"<b>The ship rises over the water, but at what cost?</b> Sailors watch their supplies drift away from the vessel, their hearts lingering after the lost items until the officers remind them of the emergency of repairs.","802013":"<b>There's nothing to be done.</b> The ship slowly sinks, pulled into the water with each new fracture in its hull. Cargo and crew are washed by the leakage and the ship vomits their remains when it crashes on the shore. The survivors contemplate the wreckage in despair before trying to put the ship back in shape.","802014":"<b>Cargo and crew are set to drown in the leakage.</b> The sailors close the hull's doors on their comrades, hushing their screams. However, there is no avoiding reopening the hull when time comes for repairs: the water flows out, carrying bodies transfixed in expressions of suffocation, terror, and betrayal.","802015":"<b>The drown cargo cannot be salvaged.</b> When the ship finally finds a harbour, its hull is so low under the waterline your crew fears the boat will sink. Although such fears are unfounded, the leakage drowned a good part of their stored food, and the repairs feel like they should have be done much earlier.","802016":"Throw supplies overboard to try and bring the crack over the waterline","802017":"Okay","802018":"Cancel","802020":"The Trial","802021":"<b>These hoodlums are asking for it.</b> To each harbour its own ill-famed tavern, and this one is no exception. While your crew enjoys a beer at the counter, the tavern's door slams open, the bartender stiffens and the volume of conversations dwindles: the newcomers are regulars of the bad kind. One of the scruffy men elbows your doctor and gasps as the alcohol splashes on his unkempt clothes. He immediately grabs your sailor by the collar and demands an apology.","802022":"They want to fight? Let them come!","802023":"Offer them a drink to ease the tension","802024":"This is a waste of time, simply apologize","802025":"<b>Your crew crushes them.</b> The collar-grabbed doctor slaps away the hand of the hoodlum, seizes his sleeve and pulls him above his shoulder, sending him to crash into a table. With a roar, the other thugs pounce on your sailors who greet them with jabs to the chin and sternum, downing the attackers with no more than two hits per man - the seconds for the pleasure of good fighting form. The tavern applauds the action and the bartender offers a round to celebrate the deserved beating.","802026":"<b>The crew overestimated themselves.</b> As he calls for the other sailors to help, the doctor gets his head smashed into the counter. His crewmates scream for revenge and look like toddlers agitating their little arms to try and hit the big bad guys. The thugs are not in the mood to play along, and one of them stabs a bawling sailor in the liver to make them shut up. They slowly die as the thugs depart, leaving the tavern in a stupor.","802027":"<b>The language of alcohol is universal.</b> The thugs take you up on your offer and eye the sailors' purses as they pass the money around to pay for the beers. As the first round arrives, one of the hoodlums speaks up and announces that they will have a drinking contest with the crew. The idea is one-sided and weirdly different from their previous aggressive attitude.","802028":"<b>Bribing them with alcohol doesn't seem to work.</b> Your crew invites the men to sit and share a beer, on them, to try and bring the tension down. The thug doesn't let go of the doctor and points at the aligned liquors behind the bartender. A glass of all of these, he says, and a bottle of your best whatever. That's way more than they can drink and way more than your sailors can afford.","802029":"Show them the drinking ability of seafarers","802030":"Drug their drinks to avoid the confrontation","802031":"<b>They call that catpiss strong?</b> There's no question regarding who wins the drinking contest: your crew is still standing and enjoying the beers long after the thugs have hit the ground, curled into whatever their stomach rejected. The pungent smell of vomit and cheap ale does not deter the sailors, who casually finish their steins, pay for them, and drag the hoodlums to the closest man of law.","802032":"<b>What kind of liquid fire do they make this with?</b> The crew is used to strong drinks and exotic ales, but the tavern's special mixture of bourbon, sugar and Ricard is way past what they can handle. The thugs are accustomed to this local horror and barely wobble while your sailors pass out one after the other. When they wake up, obviously, their purses are missing.","802033":"<b>War anaesthetics are remarkably useful against small-time thugs.</b> After a few rounds spent boasting their virile resistance to any kind of liquor, the crew notices the drop in attention of their opponents and their doctor seizes the opportunity, lacing the incoming mugs with just the right dosage of chloroform. The snoring hoodlums are delivered to the local authorities, who enjoy the unexpected present.","802034":"<b>The dosage doesn't put the thugs to sleep: it kills them.</b> The doctor sidles among the thugs, lacing their drinks and snickering in expectation. Soon the effects appear: the gang shows drowsiness, then nausea, loses control of their movements and tumbles against the counter, their faces taking on a waxy yellow color. The crew can do nothing as the hoodlums break into seizures and foam at the mouth. They win the drinking contest by default, murderers of their opponents.","802035":"If it's a fight they want, they'll get one","802036":"Pay up","802037":"<b>The crew is humiliated.</b> They empty their purses trying to pay for the excessive demands of the thugs. Ale. Stew. Liquors. Meats. When sunrise pushes the hoodlums to leave the tavern, the sailors are stuck with cooking, dishwashing and dust-wiping until the bartender considers their debt paid.","802038":"<b>Your sailors apologize through gritted teeth.</b> Pleased by their groveling, the thugs do not pester them anymore, yet the heavy stares of the other clients push your crew to leave the tavern. Next time, they will show them. Next time.","802040":"The Mutiny","802041":"<b>Clear skies, calm seas, and mutiny brewing among your sailors.</b> The strain of the expedition, the rationing of supplies, the though of danger and the constant, unnerving lack of recognition: it doesn't take much to push the crew over the brink between obedience and its opposite. They unite behind the charisma of their chaplain and drift away from the authority of the first lieutenant.","802042":"Have the lieutenant meet the unofficial leader","802043":"Offer a rise to the chaplain","802044":"Make an example out of the ring leader","802045":"Ignore the discontent and let it wane","802046":"<b>The two men reach an understanding.</b> The chaplain's demands are understandable, and the first lieutenant's limits are logical. Both agree on working to reach a better balance of power and supply repartition within the crew, and they leave satisfied with the encounter. A fair outcome for everyone.","802047":"<b>The discussion reaches an end, somehow.</b> The first mate doesn't listen to the chaplain and the chaplain doesn't hear the first mate. Their to-ing and fro-ing is exasperating even to their own allies. After an endless debate over meaningless details, the two men seem to reach an agreement and shake on it, ending the hostilities. In truth, the established innovations are nothing more than old measures with new faces: novelty, not change.","802048":"<b>There is no trust to be found in the rebel's hearts.</b> The chaplain refuses to meet your first lieutenant on the deck and invites him to join him in his own quarters instead: in short, in hostile territory.","802049":"Negotiate with the chaplain in his quarters","802050":"That's enough disobedience, arrest the chaplain","802051":"<b>The lieutenant manages to reason with the chaplain.</b> The officer comes to the ringleaders' quarters unarmed, and stands his ground while surrounded by nothing but hostile faces. He call to the faith of the chaplain and argues for a slow if deep change in the ship's line of command, offering his own position to the chaplain as long as he his kept as a close advisor. His stepping down is discouraging for the loyalists, but it was the only available option at this point.","802052":"<b>The meeting goes nowhere.</b> With each new compromise offered by the first lieutenant the chaplain adds an additional request, growing more and more assured of his dominance in the current stalemate. The officer leaves with a list of impossible demands and the ringleader's followers stop working altogether. The ship comes to a stop, waiting for a decision to be made.","802053":"<b>The discussion is one-sided and disastrous.</b> The first lieutenant barges in the chaplain's quarters and belches a series of commands, menacing the ringleader and his men of flogging, hanging, marooning and flogging again. The loyalists feel ashamed of following such a disrespectful idiot. Under the cover of the night, when the chaplain and his followers steal a long boat to desert the unbearable rule of the officers, many sailors follow. Less than half of the original crew remains.","802054":"Be subtle, send the chaplain poisoned wine","802055":"Be clear, arrest the chaplain for high treason","802056":"Be ambiguous, ignore the chaplain's demands","802057":"<b>A swift and efficient assassination.</b> Convinced of his advantage in the current situation, the chaplain gracefully accepts the first lieutenant's wine. The poison does not act immediately, but its effect is unequivocal: at dawn, the chaplain is bent over his desk, wide-eyed and grey as dust. No sailor dares to mention the reason for his death. Their caution enforces discipline, fear of their officers, and a general distrust of alcohol.","802058":"<b>The poison is obvious.</b> The wine reeks, its smell so deadly and its color so murky it might as well have a skull and bones drawn on its label. The chaplain forces the lieutenant's envoy to drink the whole mixture. As the poor girl quivers and coughs blood and bile, the ringleader and his followers leave their quarters - by the time the envoy is dead, they are standing before the first lieutenant's cabin, armed and set on killing.","802059":"In a final attempt at peaceful resolution, offer a bribe","802060":"There is no choice but to confront them","802061":"This will be costly.","802062":"Okay","802063":"Cancel","802064":"<b>The bribe is enough, but its price goes beyond monetary value.</b> The chaplain's despise for the first lieutenant spreads to the crew as they learn of the murder attempt, and the mob of sailors lock their officers in their cabins to stay there until the end of the trip. That they were not killed is the only victory the officers can enjoy.","802065":"<b>True anger can only be quelled with bribes of blood.</b> The chaplain ignores the first lieutenant's plea. The man of faith pulls a rosary from his wrist, gestures for his men to act, and prays. With each bead which passes under his fingers a rebel plants his sword into the lieutenant, and as the officer screams so does the chaplain chants, louder and louder, until the prayer stops. When they leave the cabin, a new and mad order is established on the ship.","802066":"<b>Reinforcements come running at the lieutenant's call.</b> The chaplain and his followers are surrounded and swiftly defeated, their strength no match for the loyalists' military training and devotion to their officers. Order is reinstated, the loyalists turned into a militia which reigns over the other sailors and suppresses any attempt at questioning the working conditions and power dynamics on the ship.","802067":"<b>The loyalists are less prepared, less convinced, and more brittle.</b> The rebels break them, destroying what few sailors still tried to uphold discipline on the ship. The chaplain has the survivors attached to the mainmast and forced to drink poison, letting their corpses rot where they stand - a display which warns all sailors against condemning his actions. The trip continues under the rule of the chaplain, with the crew convinced that they just replaced a tyrant with another.","802068":"<b>The man of faith is captured and executed.</b> The loyalists storm the chaplain's quarters and seize him before his followers can react - men used to fight with words can do little in the face of physical oppression. The chaplain is judged on the deck for all to see and hear, accused of high treason, then hanged on the mainmast and left to rot for a week. Fear keeps the sailors in check for the rest of the trip.","802069":"<b>The arrest is a bloodbath.</b> If the loyalists had had an advantage in discipline or numbers, the arrest could have been quick. However, the whole crew enters the melee, sailors hitting each other blindly, unsure which side they're attacking and which they belong to. The chaplain is dragged across the deck and hanged without trial: a display of gratuitous violence which brings the sailors back to their senses. The body of the man of faith oscillates in the wind, shredded and limp, mirroring the crew.","802070":"<b>Inaction is not what the sailors hoped for.</b> Both loyalists and rebels are dismayed by the absence of decision and restlessness spreads through the crew until the tension finally explodes: the first lieutenant is found dead in his quarters. The defiant act is not punished and most sailors interpret it as yet another sign of weakness, while others argue that the murder was judgment in and of itself.","802071":"<b>The loyalists' strength dwindles when facing friends.</b> Loyalists and troublemakers collide in a short and feeble brawl, each side unable to give up or to kill their former crewmates. Shots willingly miss, slashes willingly fumble, punches willingly go limp. The fight goes out without a clear victor, and the rest of the trip is spent with both side wary of each other.","802072":"<b>The loyalists are too weak.</b> The conflict erupts into an exchange of slurs, then blows, then gunshots. Men and women frantically try to kill sailors who were good friends and both first lieutenant and chaplain are no exceptions: the ring leader unexpectedly draw a sword and both men impale each other, their deaths signaling the end of the senseless fight. The crew collects its thoughts to mourn the man of Church for the efforts he put in for them.","802073":"The chaplain looks expectantly.","802074":"Okay","802075":"Cancel","802076":"<b>A pragmatic solution.</b> The amount offered to the chaplain to buy his obedience is enough for the man of faith to ignore the incongruity of the monetary negotiations. With the roots of their problem still present the crew remains unruly, but the bought leader makes sure to maintain their anger at the lowest levels.","802077":"<b>The offer does not match the chaplain's expectations.</b> If his calmness is to be bought, the price should be enough for him to share with all the sailors he roused. The offended man of faith retreats to his quarters without a word.","802078":"<b>The budding mutiny is easily crushed.</b> The first lieutenant and two loyalists are all it takes to seize the chaplain and drag him to judgement: the man is condemned to be marooned on the next deserted island they find, and left to die at will or live in solitude. The swift arrest and punishment impresses the rest of the crew and renews their respect for their officers.","802079":"<b>The loyalists' strength dwindles when facing friends.</b> Loyalists and troublemakers collide in a short and feeble brawl, each side unable to give up or to kill their former crewmates.

For a moment the ropes tying it to the other masts hold it in place, but there is only so much weight they can take: they break with a snap, letting the mizzenmast plummet on the deck. A sailor now wails, his leg caught under a pole twice his size.","802085":"Cover the leg with a mix of water and soap and pull it away","802086":"Cut the leg with a bone saw","802087":"Lift the mast with a makeshift lever","802088":"<b>The sailor is easily pulled from under the mast.</b> The foamy water allows the crushed leg to slither away from the debris and the limb emerges covered in rainbow bubbles and bloody splinters. The man will live and maybe, with a miracle or two, his leg will mend.","802089":"<b>An extreme but commendable choice.</b> The sailor is given rum to drink and cloth to bite before he is held in place, his leg bound with a tight tourniquet. The doctor's labour is gruesome and the man can feel the grinding cuts as they tear through him, and he screams through the cloth and he howls and he roars - and yet the doctor stays composed and focused. When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels that they are in capable hands.","802090":"<b>Butchery.</b> The doctor's hands tremble more than his victim does, and the saw draws zigzags in the flesh, each cut unable to connect with the previous ones. The trapped sailor's screams become whimpers, then silence. The doctor has to be stopped before he can ruin any more of the unfortunate corpse, and his blood-clad figure sends a warning to whoever might ever need his help in the future.","802091":"<b>The man is freed.</b> Using one of the partners broken by the mast, the crew fits the sturdy pieces of timber between the deck and the fallen mast, adding plank after plank in the opening and gradually raising the mast with ropes and pulleys tied to the mainmast. They manage to lift the mast long enough to free the sailor, and the doctor immediately tends to his crushed leg.","802092":"<b>The vague idea of a lever never becomes real.</b> The sailors try to lift the mizzenmast by rolling logs underneath, but the huge wooden pole is far too heavy for its rolling movement to be controlled. The mast lurches forward and rolls from the sailor's leg to his chest, pushing his insides out. The view stays with the sailors for days before they can finally reach a decent harbour, get rid of the broken mast, and clean up the grisly mess underneath.","802094":"Sea Still","802095":"<b>Tangled!</b> The Sargasso Sea was made famous by Columbus' sailors and their fear of entrapment: indeed, the vast surfaces of algae that stretch above the diamond waters look ominous, and their menace is confirmed by the ship standing still in their midst. Your own vessel avoids the brown plants, when a call rings from the stuck ship. There are still sailors onboard! You have no proper rescue equipment and risk getting tangled - should you try to help?","802096":"A steam ship fears no entanglement - go rescue them!","802097":"Help from a distance and fire a roped harpoon at their ship","802098":"Do not take any risk and leave","802099":"Your steam ship rides through the algae as if it was nothing. In fact, it is. The algae parts before your ship from the sole movement of the waves. Your sailors stay stunned as they see the legend break before them, and the rescued crew reveal their truth: it was the dreadfully calm winds of the Sargasso sea that caught their ship, not the flimsy algae. The saved sailors happily join your own and marvel at the steam ship's independence from the winds.","802100":"<b>A perfect shot.</b> With just the right dosage of propulsion strength and aiming power, the harpoon strikes the stranded ship's starboard without damaging too much of its hull. The rope is collected by the crew onboard and they bind it to their railings before waiting for your instructions.","802101":"<b>Harpooning a ship without sinking it requires skills you crew doesn't have.</b> The harpoon crashes into the stranded vessel and breaks through its starboard, allowing water to gush inside. Panicked screams emerge from the ship as several sailors jump into the water's algae in a desperate attempt to save themselves.","802102":"Tie a buoy to the improvised zip line and create a transportation device","802103":"Encourage the sailors to climb the rope and cross the distance on their own","802104":"<b>A flawless breeches buoy.</b> The buoy is tied with ropes and cloth to create a solid leg harness, allowing the stranded sailors to be pulled to your ship in an almost comfortable manner. Once freed of the algae embarked on their clothes, the rescued crew eagerly offer their services to repay their life debt.","802105":"<b>The buoy comes undone with the first rescue attempt.</b> As soon as a sailor climbs onto the contraption, it slips and swirls and sends him into the water. The ripples part the algae, revealing how meek the obstacle was: it was the still winds, not the plants, which prevented the ship from moving. The crews from both ships watch helplessly as the man drowns in the clear waters, before resuming their rescue in gloom and shame.","802106":"<b>A surge of courage animates the stranded sailors.</b> Under the cheers of your crew and the repeated encouragements of your lieutenants, they grab the rope and, with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Their miraculous rescue leaves them stronger and confident in both their skills and your crew's good will - they join your sailors without a second thought.","802107":"<b>Hope alone cannot give them strength.</b> Encouraged by your crew, one of the sailors of the stuck ship takes hold of the rope and suspends himself, legs crossed and hands gripping the hemp. As he begins his travel the coarse fibbers nibble his skin and the blood rushes to his head. He grabs a new handful of rope, fails, slips, falls. If he manages to climb back onboard, no other volunteer wishes to attempt the crossing, and you have to leave without a single sailor rescued.","802108":"Send strong sailors with buoys to rescue them","802109":"You will not risk sharing their entangled fate: leave","802110":"<b>The rescue is cruelly easy.</b> Your sailors plunge into the waters and see the algae part before them: there's no real obstacle here. They grab the stranded crew as it drifts to them and bring them back onboard, where the rescued men explain that it was the dead winds which forced their ship to stay still. Their thankfulness is barely enough to erase your wasted efforts and the shame of your crew.","802111":"<b>The rescue is a failure.</b> Your sailors push each other, trying to swim while pulling the huge buoys, and they paddle like young dogs discovering their first waters. They are exhausted way before they can reach the stranded ship, and they turn around despite your crew's encouragements and the lieutenants' orders. There is no ignoring the curses of the drowning sailors as your ship sails away.","802112":"<b>We did what we could.</b> Fully aware that your crew's attempt did nothing but worsen the stranded sailors' fate, your lieutenants attempt a speech to lighten their burden. The sailors pretend to cheer up, but the thought of the abandoned ship stays with them.","802113":"<b>Someone better equipped might come their way.</b> Or we will call for help at the next harbour. Or this could be a trap. Or we didn't really hear a call. Excuses after excuses are discussed this night, and none sounds true enough for the sailors' hearts to be at peace.","802115":"Lava Maze","802116":"<b>Tremors, ash rain, light during night: it's an eruption!</b> The island was too lush and bountiful to be harmless. The lava responsible for the fertile ground creeps from the mouth of the waking volcano and towards the jungle where a party of your men had erected camp for the night.","802117":"Go back to the ship despite the darkness","802118":"Find shelter against the incoming lava","802119":"<b>The ship is quickly found.</b> The burning lights of the volcano illuminate the jungle and a handful of seasoned explorers lead the rest of the sailors back to the ship, zigzagging between shadows and fleeing animals. The vessel departs as the island is engulfed in flames, a vision as terrible as it is magnificent.","802120":"<b>The sailors are swallowed by the jungle's maze.</b> Dense trees, moving shadows, screeching animals and the crew itself, whose silhouettes are deformed by the scorching heat. Too many visions allow panic to spread among the men, who cannot recognize the path and never make it back to the ship.","802121":"<b>Shelter!</b> The crew finds a decrepit stone chapel, remains of a colonialist power, and deems it a better refuge than their cloth-made tents. An officer estimates that the lava will be on them soon: there's no choice but to spend the night here.","802122":"<b>Your crew is lost and perplexed.</b> Your most committed explorers cannot wrap their heads around the complexity of the jungle, which changes with every new burnt tree, and it seems that every uncovered path might end in lava-devoured dead ends.","802125":"Pray for the chapel to hold","802126":"Dig trenches in the holy ground","802127":"<b>The chapel miraculously stands its ground.</b> Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nested on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.","802128":"<b>Their faith is nothing but hypocrisy in need.</b> The crew remembers old aves from their worshipping days, but the years have eroded both their memory and their beliefs. They can only watch as the lava packs against the chapel's stained glass and breaks through. The spray of molten stone and broken glass scars all of them but kills none: a bite to remind them of their lack of dedication.","802129":"<b>The trenches are dug with military efficiency.</b> Despite the darkness and the imminent danger, the sailors manage to dig deep trenches in no time and the pits redirect the lava as it flows in. The sailors snuggle in the chapel while lava runs around them, illuminating the stained glass, and they rejoice in the warm comfort of their shelter.","802130":"<b>Too much pressure and too little grit.</b> The sailors can dig little more than scattered and knee-deep pits which have a negligible impact on the lava's course. As the crew scurries inside the chapel, so does the lava enters the sacred place and hugs the walls, its smoke burning throats and forever robbing the men of their voices.","802131":"Follow a random animal and trust its instincts","802132":"Pick a random path and trust your instincts","802133":"<b>All animals run to the beach, and your crew follows.</b> Tracking down the herd of squealing, screeching, shrilling critters could be done with eyes closed and the sailors are led to the shore where they had beached. The ship departs in a hurry, leaving the animals to die into the ruthless volcano fire.","802134":"<b>Your hunters find no pattern in the animals' frenzy.</b> The sailors run in a display of panic and poor judgment, mimicking the animals' despaired behavior. The crew still on the ship can only watch in horror as the island's greatest predator burns all preys, be they beast or human.","802135":"<b>Fear is the most reliable instinct.</b> The sailors scamper through the jungle, chasing after their lava-created shadows. They stumble upon the beach by pure miracle and hop on the ship with the molten tongues on their heels, and the ship departs with a slightly charred hull but a safe crew.","802136":"<b>Fear is a treacherous adviser.</b> Seeing that the only unburnt path is up, the sailors climb the jungle's trees in an attempt to escape the lava flow. Ground, then bark, then branches, then humans: everything burns. In the distance, the ship's remaining crew stay transfixed as they witness the volcano island devouring itself.","802138":"Selfless Deeds","802139":"<b>\"They steal your children?\"</b> The air hangs heavy around the sailors as their question withers in the hut. Their hosts consider the explorers, half-hopeful, half-eaten with the certitude that non-paying jobs are not the ones your crew enjoys. One child has to be offered with each new moon, an elder explains as she gestures towards the nearby river, or else bandits raid the surrounding settlements. Tomorrow, the bandits' steamboat will come to claim this village's due.","802140":"Board the bandits' steamer with your gunboat","802141":"Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff","802142":"Stay on your ship and deploy fire when the steamboat appears","802143":"Ignore the bandits and go on your way","802144":"<b>Your assault is swift and without a single casualty.</b> The kidnappers oppose no resistance when their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout, a sweatshop with no other employees than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exulting parents: they give no rewards but smiles and tears, and your crew basks in this priceless payment.","802145":"<b>Your crew navigates through the mangrove with aplomb.</b> The unusual environment doesn't manage to stop their steady rowing, and the sailors soon reach an outpost marking the entrance of the bandits' camp. Sobbing children are taken out of the kidnappers' steamboat and dragged towards a distant barn. Half a dozen armed men guard the building.","802146":"<b>The terrain is not one your crew is used to.</b> They get stuck in the mangrove roots and their swearing can be heard all the way to the coast. When they manage to get free, the bandits' steamboat is waiting, its railings lined with guns.","802147":"<b>Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.</b> The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate and they lose the bandits. They stumble upon both less and more than what they expected: a pit filled with torn shoes and their torn makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.","802148":"Attack the bandits before they reach the barn","802149":"Hide between the tree and wait for nightfall","802150":"<b>The bandits don't know what hit them.</b> Using the element of surprise to their advantage, your sailors break into the camp and stifle the children's escorts before they can call for help. They hush the kids and squat behind what few bushes offer protection, monitoring the other bandits. The attack wasn't noticed.","802151":"<b>The sailors are unfit for a swift assault.</b> Their choreographed clumsiness and dissonant roars drive the opponents back not because of their strength but because of the unconventional display. After an instant of bafflement, the kidnappers shout for others to join them and the whole gang soon surrounds your crew. They part to let their leader, a beast of a man, face the puny intruders.","802152":"Go all out on the bandits and save the remaining children","802153":"Acknowledge the danger and leave with what children are already saved","802154":"<b>Sailors and kids create a breathtaking chaos.</b> The crew shoots and skewers while the children kick and bite their former oppressors, calling others to do the same. A deluge of shrieking kids and young adults emerges from the barn and attacks the guards, thrilled by your crew's display of strength. The band of unlikely fighters seize the bandits' steamboat, help themselves to their supplies, and triumphantly returns to the coast.","802155":"<b>Audacity does not make up for their lack of numbers.</b> The crew manages to take down five guards before the noise attracts more armed bandits, and the sailors are driven back to their boat without a chance to liberate more children. The flee to the village and share what information they can with the villagers, glad to have freed some kids but aware that many more are still captive.","802156":"<b>The decision to run is not a simple one.</b> The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be and retreat to the village with the few children they have saved. They share what information they can with the villagers - maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, more planning... As the ship leaves the crew focuses on the good they did, rather than the deeds they could have done.","802157":"Fight the brute","802158":"Run away","802159":"<b>Your sailors' cause fuels their victory.</b> Driven by their will to save the children, your sailors do not waver in front of the bandits' leader, all muscles and swords and wild eyes. It takes six fighters to face the man, piling up on him in a torrent of dust and groans until he finally stops rampaging. Disheartened by this defeat and their leader's meaningless pride, the remaining kidnappers are brought to their knees and the children are freed. The crew returns to the village triumphant!","802160":"<b>The mastodon tramples your sailors.</b> The rescuers lack resistance and they are wiped by the bandits' leader, their corpses sent flying among the children who can do nothing but watch in horror. In a ultimate act of hatred, a young girl is sent back to her village to retell the carnage and warn future intruders against trying to rescue the children again.","802161":"<b>No sailor harmed, no child saved.</b> The crew manages to run back to the village, avoiding the multiple gunshots fired by the kidnappers. That no sailor was wounded is a miracle, but it pales when your rescue team comes back with no rescued child.","802162":"<b>The crew merges with the trees.</b> Unseen, unheard, the sailors bury themselves in the forest and observe their future targets. An opportunity arises when a group of bandits leave their posts to bathe in the river: splashing and talking, they do not hear your men approach.","802163":"<b>The sailors are not attuned to the notion of stealth.</b> They argue about the best place to hide and end up lining behind what could be the thinnest trees of the forest, their racket and bulging shapes attracting the undivided attention of the kidnapers. Their leader, more beast than man, advances to inspect the intruders and laughs at the puny men.","802164":"Steal their clothes to disguise as bandits","802165":"Capture the men to use them as hostages","802166":"<b>Your sailors in disguise orchestrate the children's escape.</b> Dressed with the bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn turned sweat shop where children are forced to work. One by one they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies: when the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunitions. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.","802167":"<b>The poorly-disguised intruders are identified and given chase.</b> When asked by an actual bandit about their shift, one of your undercover sailors tries to answer: they fumble and bumble until the bandit grabs them and shouts for intruders. They make a run for it with the others, leaving both kidnappers and children behind.","802168":"<b>A flawless action, from start to finish.</b> After a swift capture of the naked bandits, the sailors advance and discover the camp's true nature: a children-powered sweatshop. It is soon obvious that the bandits' leader is the only one who does not care for the hostages, and the man is forcibly exchanged by his crew against the promise that your sailors will never set foot here again. The rescuers come back with children on their shoulders, a culprit to be judged, and goods to be shared.","802169":"<b>The naked men overpower your fighters.</b> The element of surprise does not compensate the lacking strength of the crew, and they are easily repelled by the bathing bandits. Instead of killing them, the kidnappers order the sailors to strip and send them back as is, rescuers unable to retrieve the children and humiliated in the process.","802170":"Face the brute","802172":"<b>The crew is puny indeed, and it is butchered.</b> The bandits' leader needs no help to fight your rescuers, who spend more time trying to avoid being hit than actually fighting back. They flee the camp, scatter into the woods, and are hunted down like game. The few sailors who make it back to the coast can't even determinate the location of the kidnappers' camp, making the deaths of their companions pointless.","802173":"Bluff and pretend backup is on its way","802174":"Attempt to buy the children","802175":"Let them be and leave","802176":"<b>Your bluff works!</b> The kidnappers have a heated discussion before handing over what few children they have onboard, pressed by the menace your crew just invented. The sailors retreat to the village and deliver the kids, still amazed by their performance but upset they could save so little.","802177":"<b>They do not buy your bluff.</b> Holding your crew at gunpoint, the bandits casually wait for the reinforcements to show up. They don't. To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his tongue before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for liars. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.","802178":"The kidnappers smirk.","802179":"Okay","802180":"Cancel","802181":"<b>A pricey but worthy trade.</b> Trying to hide their distaste for treating children like goods, your sailors bring the kids onboard. They are in a state of shock but look physically sound.","802183":"The children are safe with you, punish their abductors","802184":"The children will be safer with their parents, let the kidnappers leave","802186":"<b>Your retribution is ruthless.</b> The kidnappers are still counting the goods you bought the children with when the crew attacks, and its assault is brutal. The steamboat is set aflame and all bandits die by fire or bullet. The crew brings the kids back to the safety of their homes, but the children now see them as no different from their captors: beasts driven by violent instincts.","802187":"<b>Your sailors are overpowered.</b> The kidnappers have fought much harder battles against much less men, and your crew's attack is dismissed with scorn. They could easily have retrieved the children, but their strange sense of honor makes them consider that goods bought are goods acquired. The crew is sent back to the village with the kids, both looking equally dishevelled and aghast.","802188":"<b>Pity to let the culprits escape so easily.</b> The sailors bring the children back to their respective families, but the kids' joy fails to hide how many more could have been saved given an extra effort.","802189":"<b>You do not match the bandits' expectations.</b> To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his thumb before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for the penniless. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.","802190":"<b>There's only so much your sailors can do.</b> They back away under the menace of the bandits' guns, doing their best not to trigger an attack, and row back to the coast. The parents of the abducted children thank them for the effort, but their strangled hopes make their voices break. The sailors leave knowing they could have done better.","802191":"<b>A masterful shot!</b> Using one of your precious spiral-muzzled cannons, the crew fires a single shot which pierces straight through the steamboat's engines. The boat gradually stops puffing and drifts to your own ship, where sailors can pluck the bandits and three stolen children.","802192":"<b>Poor use of your firepower.</b> The sailors handling the cannons and the weapons themselves are equally important: not as well-oiled as the machinery, the crew fails to adjust the quantity of powder used, firing the artillery to its maximum range without any kind of aiming. They might as well have lit signal fires. The bandits' boat makes a brutal turn and retreats in the bayou at full speed.","802193":"<b>Both bandits and captives are killed.</b> The villagers watch in horror as your ship fires its cannons at the small steamboat as soon as it is in sight, annihilating the frail vessel and all life onboard. Mothers and fathers rush in the water, screaming and crying as tiny bodies slowly emerge. If your crew had had a greater control over themselves and the ship, maybe they wouldn't have had to bear the weight of these children's deaths.","802194":"Scare the kidnappers into revealing the position of their hideout","802196":"Enough risks for today: return the children and be on your way","802197":"<b>Your seafarers coerce the river-dwellers into saying the truth.</b> There is a world of knowledge and pain into your men's eyes, and the bandits are overwhelmed by their presence before a single word is spoken. The revealed hideout is an easy prey for your crew, which storms through the den and triumphantly bring all children back to their parents, along with the bandits' possessions and supplies.","802198":"<b>The intention is here, but not the result.</b> The bandits recognize your sailors for what they are: sharp-shooters indeed, but weaklings when it comes to close-range confrontation. The crew's threats are nothing to them. Knowing that these men know where the rest of the children are held, your crew hands them to the villagers along with the kids they found, and leave with a feeling of defeat.","802199":"<b>Thoughts of the remaining captives follow your crew.</b> The villagers are thrilled to have the handful of children returned to them and profusely thank their saviors, making their remorse worse with each new praise. The sailors are happy for them but know they could have done more.","802200":"<b>Not all sailors share your lack of compassion.</b> Some men and women refuse to leave and the officers have no choice but to let them do as they please lest they'd lose even more of the crew's trust. Many sailors argue that staying to help was the right choice, but the ship has already set sail when they voice their opinion.","802201":"Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff","802203":"The Amazons","802204":"<b>The splendid warriors are all women.</b> Exploring the deserted coastal settlement was a nice opportunity for looting, but it seems your crew wasn't the only one to get this idea. As they push the village's rundown barricade, they happen upon a group of warriors who immediately assume a defensive formation in a motion almost too perfect to be human. There's not a single man among them.","802205":"Let a woman do the talking","802206":"Present your peaceful intentions","802207":"Bow before the goddesses","802208":"<b>The warriors greatly enjoy your specialist's company.</b> Glad to see a fellow woman act as a presence of power, the fighters invite your crew to share the bounty of their raiding: despite the difference in tongue and civilization, your sailors enjoy a feast of exotic game and liquor and spend the night improvising songs and dances with the women.","802209":"<b>Your diplomat dispels the barrier of language.</b> Mimicking the sailors' trip through the seas and showing the women their ship, maps and supplies, the diplomat manages to have them understand the goals of your crew. The warriors eagerly observe your charts and point out what areas your ship should investigate next - their excitement suggesting their own love of discovery. Crew and women part with the conviction of having met like-minded explorers.","802210":"<b>Groveling is not respect.</b> Your diplomat treats the women like savages, kneeling before them and uttering oooh and aaah sounds which are seen as insulting even by the crew. One of the female warriors steps forward and plants a lance in his thigh.","802211":"Respond to their violence in kind","802212":"Appease them with gifts","802213":"<b>Your guns provide an underhanded upper hand.</b> While the warriors fight with lances and short war hammers, your sailors draw their pistols and fire them at will. The women draw back, dragging their wounded and dead away, while your crew savor the bitter victory. How would they have fared without the guns?","802214":"<b>Small arms, huge defeat.</b> The sailors fire their pistols at the women in a clumsy and disorganized manner, which cannot hold against the warriors' discipline and flawless coordination. Walking on the corpses of their own kin, the women pierce through your ranks and slaughter them. They spare what few explorers were women and let them run back to the ship.","802215":"The women look interested but cautious.","802216":"Confirm","802217":"Cancel","802218":"<b>The exotic supplies intrigue the warriors.</b> Curiosity replaces their anger and seeing how fascinated they are by the crew's maps, the sailors guess that the women might share their taste for exploration. Sadly, it is too late to earn the warriors' trust and they leave with your presents in silence.","802219":"<b>A waste of time.</b> The warriors barely have the time to examine your supplies that an officer barks an order to pull the crates back into the ship, leaving the women baffled and offended. The officer heads flies and the warriors cleave through your sailors until they reach your cargo. They leave with a tall barrel of liquor and disappear from the scene of carnage.","802220":"<b>Your crew's deference pleases the warriors.</b> Surprised by the sailors bowing before them in respect, the women giggle and lower their guard. They tap the explorers' chins with the tip of their lances, inviting them to drop their hunching position for a proper face-to-face. Although they do not share a language, they manage to communicate through their love of meat and drink, and the feast lasts deep into the night.","802221":"<b>Can these men show real respect?</b> Your sailors cannot translate their admiration in their acts. They crawl to the women and hold their hands, letting their sweat soil the soft skin and their eyes trail the soft shapes. One of the warrior spits to their face in disgust. The other women imitate her and walk away, whispering among themselves.","802222":"Wash this offense in blood","802223":"Ignore the humiliation and let them leave","802224":"<b>The assault is one-sided.</b> Your sailors draw their guns and shoot the warriors in their backs, taking down the women with ease and ganging up against the remaining ones. Reassured of their fortitude, the men leave the settlement and try to ignore the debasing aspect of this unnecessary bloodshed.","802225":"<b>Skill, conviction, discipline: your men lack them all.</b> They draw their guns and fire at the women, who react at once and pounce on their assailants. Short war hammers appear in their hands and end up in skulls. One hit, one kill. Terrified by the warriors' martial ability, the survivors abandon the fight and run back to the ship.","802226":"<b>The sailors feel humiliated.</b> They let the warriors leave and console themselves as they can by looting the remains of the settlement, but the women have left no stone unturned. Empty-handed and disgraced, they go back to the ship.","802228":"The Deeper You Go","802229":"<b>Boulder-blocked entrance and booby-trapped corridor: typical Mayan temple.</b> After a fall down a slide and a crash into uncharted caves, your team of explorers jokes about the situation to forget its deathly aspect. They know what is said of Mayan mazes: the deeper you go, the shinier it gets.","802230":"Follow the suggested route and progress through the traps","802231":"Create your own path and push the boulder away","802232":"<b>The obvious traps are easily evaded.</b> The sailors contort themselves to avoid sharp stones and plated triggers, flowing through the corridor with the ease of seasoned explorers, or cutpurses. They quickly reach the pocket of the temple: a vast chasm crossed by a meager bridge with no handrails. Could this be a trial of courage?","802233":"Cross the run-down bridge","802234":"<b>The trial is passed!</b> As they swing their arms to keep their balance, your sailors hit ropes suspended around the bridge, hidden by a clever camouflage of paint and shadow play. They grasp the ropes to steady their footing and a distant mechanism clicks. A rumbling door opens on the other side of the chasm, revealing the exit and, on its threshold, a shiny artifact.","802235":"<b>Nothing rewards your sailors' recklessness.</b> It is unclear whether the bridge is shaking because of its own frailty or because of your explorers' quivering legs. Soon the crew is on its knees, creeping across the moldy planks and begging for their mothers. They reach the other side without a scratch save for their wounded pride and find a tunnel which leads them outside after some more crawling.","802236":"Climb down the chasm","802237":"<b>The climb is child's play.</b> Rock walls provide a much steadier footing than wind-flogged masts. The sailors reach the bottom of the chasm, where they find an army of ropes stretching into the darkness above: the entrails of the temple's mechanisms! They find what might have been the Mayan engineers' entrance and leave the temple with filled pockets and memories.","802238":"<b>The effort is above the crew's strength.</b> An officer loses her nerve and her grip, slips down the stone, and a soft thud welcomes her fall. Smooth slithering sounds hush her desperate cries. The floor is covered in snakes!","802239":"Find a way among the snakes","802240":"Scare the snakes away with torches","802241":"<b>The sailors manage to flee.</b> Too occupied by the convulsing mass of the fallen officer, the reptiles do not notice the furtive crew as it tip toes past them and escapes through the first tunnel available. The explorers emerge outside of the temple, stunned by their survival.","802242":"<b>They cannot read the snakes' behaviour.</b> The sailors progress among the wriggling floor, so focused on their movements they do not see the mass of snakes backing away from them and piling against the sole exit. The crew has no choice but to run into the tunnel before it is filled with snakes, and several sailors end up as reptile diner.","802243":"<b>The crew stands its ground as well as it can.</b> The burning torches are swung before the snakes, forcing them back from both sailors and prey. The officer is pulled to her feet and dragged with the rest of the crew through a windy tunnel which leads them outside, empty-handed but safe.","802244":"<b>What should the snakes be scared of, exactly?</b> Your crew flaps the torches around them in a ballet of shaking hands and dripping sweat, and they cannot even make one step forward that a young sailor waves his torch past the limits of safety. The snakes leap on your crew, leaving none but a single witness alive.","802245":"<b>The challenge demands more coordination than the crew has.</b> Surprised by the brushing elbow of a comrade, a sailor squeals in terror and jumps back, triggering trap after trap of flying arrows, flaming oils, poison sprays. Once the most sensational traps have simmered down, the roof collapses and seals the exit. Sand slowly starts to fall from the walls.","802246":"Look for a possible hidden mechanism","802248":"Break a possibly weak wall","802249":"<b>The patterns of the mechanism do not escape your hunters' probing.</b> Upon close and cool-headed inspection, one the sand-spewing hourglass engravings appears to be protruding from the wall. The sailors smash the button, forcing the wall to open and reveal an exit. They immediately run away from the sand and the temple itself.","802250":"<b>If there is a mechanism, they do not find it.</b> Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them, forcing its way into their noses and mouth. The explorers utter muted screams. As the sand packs against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.","802251":"<b>The old wall caves in effortlessly.</b> Following the sand-pouring cracks, the explorers identify the wall from which most grains seem to be coming. They stave it in, causing a dusty outpour which fills their lungs then clears to reveal sunlight. They hasten through the self-made exit and end up on the beach where they had left the ship.","802252":"<b>The explorers bang on the walls helplessly.</b> Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them, forcing its way into their noses and mouth. The crew utters muted screams. As the sand packs against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.","802253":"<b>The boulder moves!</b> The combined efforts of the crew manage to lift the giant stone out of its socket. As the boulder rolls, a loud snap resonates and the rock bounces back in place. A wall falls behind the sailors and, in a concert of grating dirt and destroyed stone, it starts to advance towards the crew.","802254":"<b>The boulder doesn't move.</b> Your explorers push and nudge and thrust but the exit stays sealed. They have no choice but to obey the maze's invitation.","802255":"Push against the wall to stop it","802256":"Look for another way out","802257":"<b>The ancient wall cannot resist your crew's pressure.</b> They grunt in unison and breathe in rhythm with their effort. One, two. The wall stops in its tracks. One. It shivers. Two. The wall crumbles, revealing a large opening under its railings: the crew finds the body of a less lucky adventurer, one hand clawing at the threshold of a gaping exit, the other gripping an oversized diamond.","802258":"<b>The wall is unfazed by your crew's efforts.</b> As an explorer gets to her knees to pray in the face of imminent death, she notices an engraving much less elaborate than the temple's decorations: scribbled letters in a language she can actually understand! </br><b>\"Crawling by day, airborne by night.\"</b></br>Right underneath the scribbling are four buttons depicting animals.","802259":"Press the sloth","802260":"Press the bat","802261":"Press the butterfly","802262":"Press the cockroach","802263":"<b>Wrong answer.</b> The brick above the pressed button opens and an arrow flies into the crew, perforating the throat of a sailor and leaving a red line in the cheek of the button-presser. The floor under the explorers tilts and they roll, a helpless mass of arms and legs which slides along the tunnel and is expelled outside the temple.","802264":"<b>Wrong answer.</b> As she presses the button, the sailor feels no resistance and keeps pushing the carved stone until her full arm is into the wall. She can feel something furry on her skin, if a bit rough and a bit- She screams. As fangs dig into her flesh, a legion of bats emerge from the opened wall, forcing the sailors to retreat through their nest. The crew emerges from the temple covered in blood and crippled with a lasting fear of the dark.","802265":"<b>Right answer!</b> The sailor hits the butterfly button and jubilates as the trap wall stops advancing and bricks whirl into the floor to shape a staircase. The crew emerges from the temple, wondering about the intentions of whoever had carved such needlessly complicated indications in their mother tongue.","802266":"<b>Wrong answer.</b>As the cockroach is pressed, the insect shivers and shakes the dust off its shell. It's alive! The ceiling opens and a swarm of cockroaches flies into the room, aiming for the sailors' mouths. The crew smashes the insects with whatever object they have at hand and their horror gives them wings of their own, pushing them to climb the walls until they reach the outside.","802267":"<b>The unfazed explorers rapidly find an exit.</b> They notice how the floor's cobblestones move to let the advancing wall pass, and wait for the right moment to jump into the space between wall and floor. One by one they land into the room below, where a large opening to the outside lets morning light in and reveals a spectacle of spiderwebs surrounding a delicate piece of sculpted mahogany.","802268":"<b>The sailors do not find an exit.</b> All stones look alike, and the crew lacks the ability to appraise which rock might be more important than the others. The advancing wall looms over, ready to crush their bones, when it suddenly leans forward and pushes the sailors to the floor, which in turn opens to eject the explorers outside the temple. They are alive, but the very sight of stone walls will scare them for years.","802269":"Songs Under the Sea","802270":"<b>The lookout is sure of himself: he saw a mermaid.</b> Despite the burning sun of noon, sailors pile up against the ship's handrails and inspect the mirror waters for more signs of the creature. At last, they glimpse its silver tail and hear its song, a mesmerizing chant which beckons them.","802272":"Have an expert examine the apparition","802274":"<b>The mermaid is half-fish, half-fish.</b> The scientist orchestrates a careful operation to retrieve the animal from the ocean, sending divers underwater to lure and catch the creature by playing with it. The miniature whale enjoys singing with your sailors for the rest of the trip.","802275":"Answer the mermaid with a sailing chant","802276":"<b>Not one, but a dozen mermaids answer the chant.</b> As your crew sings of their country ruling the waves and their patriots never being slaves, the marine creatures react joyfully and surround the ship, jumping along its sides. These animals are no mermaids. They're frisky little whales!","802277":"Try to catch one of them","802278":"<b>An effortless catch for your fishermen.</b> Taking care not to hurt the beautiful creatures, the sailors casts multiple nets in the water and retrieve an individual from the pack, quickly transferring it to one of your wildlife aquariums. The animal seems to enjoy the constant attention and the free food, and the crew falls in love with the playful \"mermaid.\"","802279":"<b>Your fishermen are not used to catching fish alive.</b> They cast a weighted nest among the pack, but as they try to pull it up the animal slips out, its tangled flipper striped with thin red lines. The creatures flee underwater, leaving the sailors longing for their song.","802280":"Leave the creatures be","802281":"<b>The moment is otherworldly.</b> The creatures dance among the waves, tweeting and clicking in response to your sailors' cheers, jumping higher with each new verse sung by their human admirers. Their ballet and innocent happiness is well worth the absence of mermaids.","802282":"<b>The mermaid vanishes.</b> The crew sings with more passion than prowess, and the creature itself doesn't deign to answer. When at last their breath is short, the sailors mourn the disappearance of the mermaid and waste more time dreaming up her sisters and their underwater kingdoms.","802283":"<b>A sailor jumps into the ocean!</b> Unfazed by the crew's heartfelt singing and longing for her, the mermaid flips her tail, teasing and staying underwater. Spurred by the chanting, one of your men leaps into the sea and is now gurgling and splashing in a parody of swimming technique, desperate to follow the creature.","802284":"Go after the mermaid and the drifting sailor","802285":"<b>Close enough for one last glimpse of the mermaid.</b> The ship slides aside the creature and the frenzied sailor swimming after it. The mermaid splashes her tail at her stalker and disappears, allowing the fallen man to be dragged back onboard, where he is immediately pressed by jealous questions. Alas, the sailor saw little of the frightened creature and its true form remains a mystery.","802286":"<b>The maneuver sends the ship crashing against both man and mermaid.</b> Too eager to catch up with the beautiful creature, several sailors grapple the steering wheel and fight to guide the ship, oblivious to the alarmed instructions of their officers. The iron prow crushes the mermaid and her follower. When they come to their senses, the sailors are not punished: their horror and shame is sanction enough.","802287":"Let the fool face his fate","802288":"<b>The smitten sailor drowns.</b> The man paddles against the light waves, his skull going in and out of the water, his lips moving feverishly and the sea sounds keeping his words for themselves. When his head doesn't resurface, the sailors know the mermaid had nothing to do with it.","802289":"Convince the sailors of ignoring the creature","802290":"<b>Discipline is stronger than fascination.</b> Galvanized by the orders of their officers, the sailors ignore the mermaid's calls and leave it behind, fulfilling their duty. They feel like heroes of ancient tales in the face of mystical temptations and the epic trial makes them shiver in pride.","802291":"<b>Fascination gets the better of your crew's discipline.</b> The men ignore all orders and deliberate among themselves, planning the best approach to catch the mermaid's attention. The officers cannot accept this undermining of their authority, and get the whips ready.","802293":"Give the dissidents a good flogging","802294":"<b>Action commands respect.</b> Four of the most unruly sailors are dragged to the stern, tied in kneeling positions, and flogged until their shirts are drenched. Acceptance spreads within the crew as their minds clear, and they resume their duties knowing that this expedition will tolerate no mischief. The mermaid was a nice but short-lived dream.","802295":"<b>The flogging exceeds discipline and goes overboard.</b> Instead of organizing a session of punishment, with explicit rules, blames and sanctions, the officers chastise at will, whipping whoever is within reach, spitting their anger in unintelligible tirades. When they calm down, the dissidents are a mass of sweat, blood, and whimpers. The mermaid cries in the distance as the crew resumes its duties.","802296":"Drop the issue and let them be","802297":"<b>Discipline aboard this ship is lax.</b> Convinced that their misconduct can go unpunished, the sailors take to ignore or bargain the officers' orders, and \"mermaid\" becomes a keyword to rally against tedious instructions. This behaviour plagues the rest of the trip.","802299":"Release the Kraken","802300":"<b>A kraken!</b> The rainstorm parts to reveal tentacles wide as a barrel and long as ten men, snaking between the waves. The creature of legends is heading towards the ship at full speed.","802301":"Fire a torpedo at the beast","802304":"<b>The so-called beast is no match for a torpedo.</b> Firing a torpedo is a first for most of your crew, yet they manage to handle the unusual weaponry with skill. The self-propelled projectile flies underwater and crashes into the kraken with an explosion that shakes the storm itself. One more tale to tell back home!","802305":"Kill the monster","802306":"<b>If harpoons can kill whales, they can kill monsters.</b> Despite the pounding rain and poor visibility, the sailors manage to load a harpoon and fire it at the kraken: the beast shakes, flails, and disappears into the sea under the triumphant cheers of the crew.","802307":"<b>Panicked men try to shoot at the monster.</b> The bullets drop into the water like meaningless pebbles and do no harm to the kraken except rouse its anger. Flailing its tentacles, the creature hits the ship with full force and soon ensnares the boat.","802308":"Try to cut the tentacles","802309":"<b>The gigantic tentacles are sawed off.</b> Using the engineers' oversized ship saw, the sailors manage to cut through the elastic flesh of the monster. The kraken convulses and lets go of ship, leaving the crew to repair the boat and wipe out what gooey blood was spilled on the deck.","802310":"<b>Measly men make no miracles.</b> The sailors assault the tentacles, trying to plant what swords and knives and forks they have at hand into the thick flesh. The suckers stay glued to the deck. The beast shakes and its suckers tremble, extending for a tense second before bouncing back up, taking large parts of the deck with them. Wood and metal rain over the sailors and the kraken leaves them to die.","802311":"Try to bombard the kraken","802312":"<b>The creature matches your strength for a short while.</b> It grabs the ship and rocks it, shaking several cannons away from their sailors. The remaining artillery is fired without delay and strikes the kraken into submission, sending it back to the depths it came from. The sailors have but light repairs to perform on the cannons.","802313":"<b>The power of the beast largely surpasses yours.</b> A glassy eye levels with the deck, reflecting the sailors's silhouettes as they make hurried preparations to shoot the cannons. The cannonballs fly by the kraken and leave it unscathed, allowing it to grapple and tip over the ship with its unsheathed hooks, pouring sailors into its beak. It then disappears from your crew's sight, but not their nightmares.","802315":"Outrun the thing","802316":"<b>Full steam ahead!</b> Using the full power of your steam ship, the vessel leaps and tears through the waves, leaving the kraken to swirl in its wake. A sailor blows the ship's horn to salute the creature and watches in delight as it plunges back into the ocean.","802317":"<b>The wind is ideal for such a maneuver.</b> Your navigators and sailors rush to their posts and work to align ship and storm, fusing the vessel with the elements. The wind carries the ship away from the kraken, and delivers it to a sunny clearing of calm and monsterless waters.","802318":"<b>Your crew cannot outmaneuver the storm.</b> They wrestle the wind and rain, their struggle showing in the chaotic movements of the ship. The kraken slips under the vessel and emerges in front of it, stopping any escape attempt by ensnaring the prow in its tentacles.","802320":"Teeth of the Mountain","802321":"<b>These tracks could belong to maneaters.</b> The crew's reconnaissance report carried intriguing rumours of local threats: abducted men and women, quarries filled with human bones, and a mountain chain too impenetrable to be devoid of valuable finds. Almost as soon as your explorers start their ascension, they spot fresh tracks in the dry leaves.","802322":"Follow the tracks","802323":"<b>Your sailors follow the tracks without trouble.</b> The trail of footprints runs among the mountain's trees, zigzaging among dead leaves and fallen trunks, disappearing under the steps of your explorers. It leads the sailors deep into the forest, to a clearing where a tiny village is nested. Under the tiled roofs of their Old World homes, the inhabitants are white-skinned and blue-eyed. If they are cannibals, they don't look the part.","802324":"Engage a friendly conversation with the inhabitants","802325":"<b>Your diplomat realizes that the autochthons speak a similar language.</b> The blue-eyed inhabitants answer in a patois laced with foreign expressions and sounds, but there is no mistaking the origins of their dialect. Pleased by the diplomat's banter, they invite your crew to share a feast of exotic meats and vegetables, and describe the grand adventures of their ancestors to your fascinated crew: tales of exiled war prisoners and their fight to create a new home.","802326":"<b>The diplomat mistakes civilized aspect for civilized behaviour.</b> She strides straight into the village, confident in the autochthons' pacifism, and spreads her arms to the nearest woman - a young girl who shrieks upon seeing her and bites the welcoming hand. The alerted villagers surround your diplomat with pitchforks and shovels. They creep on her, poking her with their improvised weapons.","802327":"Face the villagers to rescue your diplomat","802328":"<b>The crew manages to rescue her.</b> Taking advantage of the villagers' obsession with the intruder, the sailors surround them and attack as one in a flurry of gunshots and slicing swords. Visibly terrified by the pistols and unable to face the military unison of your crew, the autochthons flee and leave the diplomat to be rescued. Wether the encounter could have been solved peacefully, you will never know.","802329":"<b>Your crew is overwhelmed.</b> They attempt a clumsy charge, overlooking any assessment of the enemy's strength, and crash against the wall of peasants' weapons. They disband as fast as they engaged the fight and become easy targets for the villagers, who gleefully hunt them and cheer each time a sailor is struck down. The rare survivors are left to ponder what grim fate awaits those who were captured.","802331":"Run away without her","802332":"<b>Run, run away!</b> Leaving your diplomat to face the villagers alone, the crew flees back to the ship. As they bury into the forest they hear a sudden and hideous scream, which ends as brutally as it erupted. No sailor comment on the voice: they all recognized the diplomat.","802333":"Survey the village's activity from a distance","802334":"<b>The crew is undetected and detects nothing of interest.</b> Your sailors conceal themselves among the trees and observe the villagers from a distance, too far from their activities to understand the reasons for the inhabitants' busy bustle. They return to the ship without proof nor denial of the rumoured cannibalism.","802336":"<b>You call that discreet?</b> The sailors tiptoe around the village, stopping every few feet to comment on which branch they should or shouldn't step on, so focused on their feet they do not even consider how the wind carries their sounds and smells. When they finally raise their heads, an army of pitchforks welcomes them.","802337":"Apologise to the villagers for trespassing","802338":"<b>Your diplomat manages to be understood.</b> She mumbles a variety of foreign words until the villagers, touched by her efforts, respond. Their language is intelligible, if made of outdated expressions: a testimony to their ancestors, they say, war prisoners sent to die here generations ago. They leave little doubt regarding which country sent them. Your sailors are ushered away before they can inquire about the villagers' past or their dietary habits.","802339":"<b>Rather than apologise, your diplomat crawls.</b> She tugs at the villagers' sleeves and shows how unarmed she is, advising your sailors to drop their own weapons in order to display their benevolence. Rather than restraint, the villagers see submission. They take the weaponry and let the sailors escape in exchange for the diplomat - the last your crew sees of her is her figure tied to a towering pole, for a purpose best left unknown.","802340":"Strike first!","802341":"<b>Where discretion fails, force prevails.</b> Your crew is unfazed by the villagers and springs to action: its sudden and precise attack knocks them down and their resistance drowns under the repeated assaults of the sailors. Your explorers step over the corpses and explore the now deserted village, where they find strings of human bones attached between houses and clicking in the breeze. They have eradicated a terrible menace!","802342":"<b>Your sailors are trampled.</b> Their meager military training barely resists in the face of the assault. The crew dissolves and flees into the forest. To their horror, human-sized snares lie on the ground, all metal teeth and blade tongues, and they bite and hook legs in a terribly perfect choreography. This forest was made to hunt humans. About half of the sailors makes it back to the ship, the others fallen prey to the maneating mountain.","802343":"<b>The path escapes the explorers, who find themselves surrounded.</b> The crew's untrained eyes cannot catch the details which indicate that the danger does not lie ahead, but behind them. When they finally sense the hostile presence, they turn to discover a vision way below their expectations: instead of savages with pierced skin and belts of human bones, they discover white men and women, their eyes blue and their clothes very civilized.","802344":"Avoid the tracks","802347":"<b>Avoiding the tracks apparently means getting as lost as possible.</b> Taking care not to cross the path of whoever laid these footprints, the sailors avoid all semblances of roads and bury themselves deep into the mountain's forest. They emerge after three days of aimless wandering, devoured not by the rumoured cannibals but by mosquitoes, ticks and leeches.","802348":"<b>Avoiding the tracks apparently means getting as lost as possible.</b> Taking care not to cross the path of whoever laid these footprints, the sailors avoid all semblances of roads and bury themselves deep into the mountain's forest.

The map is not a rare item: several expedition team have owned and followed it, but all campaigns ended in disaster. Will your crew be the one to prevail against the Mayan map's challenges?","802353":"Hire a guide to navigate the jungle","802354":"The guide waits for an offer.","802355":"Confirm","802356":"<b>The guide is used to following the Mayan map.</b> She leads the crew through a path she knows by heart, and your sailors cannot help but wonder about the fate of the previous explorers. Dead, the guide says. She halts as the group comes near a waterfall, its center parted by a carved crag and opening on a cave filled with the echo of dripping water. The map insists you should go inside, but the guide refuses to go any further: death awaits beyond this threshold.","802357":"Cancel","802358":"<b>Your crew is on its own.</b> The guide scoffs at their refusal to pay her price, and wishes them good luck, teasing them about dangers as numerous as they are implausible. The sailors tense up.","802359":"Follow the map without help","802361":"<b>The sailors follow the Mayan map through the jungle maze.</b> Tracks of the numerous explorers who came before them render the terrain illegible, but your crew is seasoned in the art of tracking and manage to find what little clues were left intact after the passage of the previous adventurers. Here two intertwined trees match the map. There a majestic waterfall. As they approach the later, they see its waters are parted by a large carved stone: underneath it is the gaping mouth of a cave.","802362":"Interpret the carvings on the stone","802363":"<b>The true treasure map is carved into the stone!</b> Your anthropologist examines the engraved crag which marks the tunnel's entrance, and understands the passage is a decoy. He combines the Mayan map with the carvings' scattered indications and leads your explorers to the pond at the feet of the waterfall. The sailors dive, bringing back piece after piece of mossy coral, which reveal artifacts when opened. A clever find!","802364":"Examine the cave for secret passages","802365":"<b>A passage!</b> The crew scrutinizes the cave's walls and are not fooled by the water flowing along them. They push through the liquid curtain and feel no ground behind it - the veil of water hides an exit. They emerge soaked, a cold breeze sticking their clothes to their skin. The wind comes from several tunnels ahead. The Mayan map indicates the correct road, but the tunnel itself states otherwise: it is collapsed and full of debris.","802366":"Build a scaffold to clear the rubble of the right path","802367":"<b>The path is secured and the reward is worth the effort.</b> The sailors with carpenter skills erect makeshift scaffolding along the sides of the blocked tunnel, progressing inch by inch as the others clear the rubble below. As they push yet another boulder, it falls forward and lets a ray of golden light pierce through. Is this El Dorado? The pyramidal cave beyond doesn't look like a city, but it is indeed filled with precious artifacts.","802368":"<b>The architectural exercise is more than your crew can handle.</b> They try to clear the rubble while supporting the tunnel's ceiling with what logs and rocks they can find, but with each new consolidation come new pieces on the brink of falling. As they push yet another boulder, it falls forward and the whole structure follows, collapsing onto itself and burying the road to El Dorado for good.","802369":"Find a way through the other tunnels","802370":"<b>Your crew triumphs of the labyrinth.</b> Following the cryptic indications of the Mayan map, they navigate through the damp tunnels and their intricate structure, taking care to mark their path onto the map for the travel back. They emerge into a cave shaped like an inverted pyramid, its center adorned with centuries-old frescoes and clay pots protecting ancient offerings. The effort was worth it!","802371":"<b>Going forward is easy, going back never is.</b> Unsure whether navigating the alternative tunnels is a good idea, the crew sends groups of two into the passageways. Devoid of the Mayan map and unable to orient themselves in the underground labyrinth, the sailors get lost in its unfathomable depths. Those who make it back are devoured by claustrophobia while those who found treasures pay it with their eternal imprisonment.","802372":"<b>They find nothing.</b> The cave is a beautiful place, its walls covered in steady streams which catch the sunlight and its air saturated with the fresh smell of moss, but no other treasures than memories can be discovered here. The crew departs, aware that the Mayan map promised much more than what they found.","802373":"Enter the cave and pray for guidance","802374":"<b>Their praying guide the explorers through the darkness.</b> As they plead for higher beings to protect them, their voices echo through the cave's wall, indicating a concealed gap in it. They cross the lucky shortcut and arrive in a large grotto pierced by multiple openings. The Mayan map points out the correct path, but time has taken its toll: the tunnel is collapsed.","802375":"<b>Are they expecting the cave to self-explore?</b> The crew sits in prayer, hoping their efforts will be rewarded with a divine sign. When the only sound to answer their pleading is the rumbling protest of their hungry stomachs, they agree that the Mayan map was a fake designed for entertainment rather than actual adventure, and they leave the rolled parchment on the ground to be slowly consumed by the mud.","802377":"<b>The sailors can't find their bearings - the jungle swallow them.</b> They fall into its pits, get clawed by its beasts, bitten by its swarms, chewed by its venomous bushes and flowers and trees. Every single living thing in the jungle tries to kill them and most succeed. Only three explorers make it back alive, swollen and feverish versions of their previous selves who babble about the Mayan map until the end of the trip.","802378":"The risks outweigh the rewards, ignore the map","802379":"<b>The map is ignored and the sailors dispirited.</b> Of course, they too understand the risks. Of course, they too see the uncertainty. Of course, but isn't the whole point of expeditions to venture into the uncertain and face unknown risks?","802381":"The Devil Calls","802382":"<b>Human voices call through the uninhabited rainforest.</b> With each new step through the humid air and dense trees, the sailors unconsciously stand closer to their priest. Rumours of the evil one's presence made them laugh when protected by the comfort of the ship but investigating the forest itself is something else. As a child's voice babbles in the distance, the priest urges the sailors to ignore it.","802383":"Have your zoologist inspect the surroundings","802384":"Ignore the voice as the priest advises","802385":"Ignore the advice and look for a rational explanation","802386":"<b>The sailors were lured by the song of a bird.</b> Through careful scrutiny of the rainforest's ground, the zoologist finds a curious brown ball hopping under the fern, its tail spread into aerial and colourful feathers. What they heard wasn't the call of the devil, but the mating song of a bird. Amazed by the creature's ability to perfectly replicate human voice, the sailors eagerly capture it to share its marvels with the world.","802387":"<b>The priest's advice works.</b> Blocking their ears and closing their hearts to the crying voice, the sailors run from the cursed place. When they allow themselves to hear again, the voices are gone and their faith is renewed, stronger than ever. Whether this call was the devil's or not, their resistance is worth celebrating.","802388":"<b>The voice is too persistent to be ignored.</b> The youthful cries haunt the sailors, and they advance through the rainforest half wanting to understand its cause, half wishing they never do. They try to light torches to reveal the evil, but the damp atmosphere snuffs them out. As day advances and nights steps in, so does the voice get closer to the men.","802389":"Have the priest face the invisible menace","802390":"Run away to the ship","802391":"<b>The priest's voice is louder than the devil's.</b></br>\"Surely God is my salvation,</br>I will trust and not be afraid.</br>The Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my defence, He has become my salvation.\"</br>The priest's chant resonates through the moist air, reverberating deep into the forest's darkness. Whether there was evil to be fought or not, the holy chant certainly silenced its call.","802392":"<b>The priest's attempts do not match the menace.</b> As he anoints each sailor with hastily blessed water, a voice identical to his laughs from the depths of the forest. After a night spent without light nor sleep, the sailors realize several of them are missing. They will never know if this was desertion or abduction.","802393":"<b>The devil's call is covered by the sailors' screams.</b> They hurtle down the rainforest with the speed of possessed men and rush inside the ship, desperate for its protection. They can never quite explain their misadventure, and become a regular targets of jokes for those who did not hear the devil.","802394":"<b>The hunters patiently let the voice come to them.</b> Knowing better than to ruffle through the thick vegetation and scare the wildlife away, the sailors stay still until a bird no bigger than a fist emerges from the fern and tweets excitedly, emitting the songs of a variety of other birds, along with human noises and voices. Delighted, the hunters decide to bring the little marvel back onboard.","802395":"<b>The sailors are not discreet hunters.</b> They rummage through the forest, so mindful of the voice they lack focus. A man walks on a tail and the giant lizard it belongs to jerks out of its leafy camouflage, rushing to climb a bystander as if it were a tree. Reacting to the movement, more beasts emerge from the ground and attack, their bites causing profuse bleeding and screaming. The crew flees in horror, convinced of the devil's presence.","802397":"The Treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid","802398":"<b>Are you ready for real treasure hunting?</b> What was set to be a routine stop at an inland tavern turned out to have a much grander potential: an elder invited your crew to join her on her hunt for the cache of the corsair Hassan Ben Sahid. The find is all she needs, she says, and she'd gladly trade the satisfaction of ending a lifelong quest against the treasure itself. Your crew bursts in excitement. A pirate treasure!","802399":"Follow the beckoning elder","802400":"Ignore the promise of riches","802401":"<b>The complete trust of your crew puts the old woman at ease.</b> A youthful spark lights her eyes as she drags your men through the town and into her hideout, a shack whose walls and floor are covered in travelling gear for all weathers. The only furniture of the place is a table which displays a map crumbling from too much usage. The plan is old and its indications are coded, the woman points out, but she's already worked out a link with the current town.","802402":"<b>The hag leads your crew into a trap!</b> Before they can realize how misplaced their trust was, the sailors are stuck between the sides of a narrow alley, armed men in front, armed men in back. They make it clear that the only treasure they're looking for is yours.","802403":"Decode the map's indications","802404":"Match the map to the surrounding landscape","802405":"<b>Knowledge of tongues can make texts talk.</b> Your diplomats work their way through the cyphers, piecing Oriental alphabets together with Latin grammatical logic. The indications do point to the current region, but rather than a precise location, the deciphered text offers an enigma:</br>\"Hassan Ben Sahid salutes you with his last breath.</br>Upon you the gifts of true solace and rebirth,</br>While I lay asleep in the lavish lap of earth.</br>May mercy find you despite my earliest death.\"","802406":"<b>The texts refuse to speak to the crew.</b> The sailors inspect the ink, place mirrors in front of what could be letters, bring a flame so close it could burn the wrinkled paper, and trigger the ire of the old explorer. She ushers the brutish crew away from her precious plan and thanks them cooly: next time, they should show more adequacy for the task they're attempting. She closes her door on her hideout and the promise of treasure.","802407":"This is spiritual: go inspect the local church","802408":"This is straightforward: go inspect the cemetery","802409":"<b>The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!</b> The old explorer leads your crew to the church. A sailor, muttering about Ben Sahid's riddle of solace and rebirth, scrutinizes the Christ crucified above the altar and soon finds a loose stone in the wall behind it. Brick by brick the wall is dismantled to reveal rusty iron daggers, ancient silver chalices, shinning gold coins. As the old woman marvels over the Moor pirate's piety and the end of her quest, she insists that the treasure be your crew's.","802410":"<b>If there is a treasure to be found, it's not here.<b> The old woman leads your sailors to the local church and they inspect the weathered building and its surrounding, but they don't see what Ben Sahid's riddle about rebirth may mean. Perhaps they simply lack the knowledge needed? The search is vain and the crew settles on enjoying the old explorer's tales of adventure, as both her and the sailors try to ignore their lingering feeling of near-accomplishment.","802411":"<b>The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!</b> Both crew and old explorer inspect every single tomb, looking for the solution to the pirate's riddle. At last a sailor points out a grave bearing not two, but a single year: an infant dead before it could live - or, as Ben Sahid put it, the earliest death. Instead of a corpse, they find jewels and gold in the casket. The old woman weeps before the end of her quest, takes a single gem, and gracefully invites your crew to take the treasure.","802412":"<b>The search is fruitless.</b> The graves all look the same. Knowing the solution lies in the pirate's riddle and its mention of the earliest death, the crew tries to find the most ancient tomb, but with age comes erosion and the dates are barely legible - this is not what the riddle meant. The sailors are forced to abandon this dead end and settle on the idea that this is as far as anyone ever got to Hassan Ben Sahid's treasure.","802413":"<b>A treasure cache!</b> Following the coast's silhouette and how it transcribes to the map, the sailors manage to find what places Hassan Ben Sahid found worthy of his time: the local church, a former red district and a suspiciously plain cliff above the sea. Indeed, the cliff is slit by a large opening which leads to a cave where the crew finds scattered riches - maybe not the full extent of the pirate's treasure, but a remarkable find nonetheless.","802414":"<b>The crew finds nothing but rocks and grasshoppers.</b> The sailors engage on a hunt to match any coastline, forest or flower bush to the map's drawings. In a final attempt to uncover Ben Sahid's cache, a sailor overturns a stone that absolutely looked like it belonged to the plan and discovers a simmering campfire: the insects grilling over the coals make for a weird, if enjoyable reward, but they are far from the promised riches.","802415":"Attack the crooks","802416":"Surrender some of your possessions","802417":"<b>Your sailors are the ones who do the beatings.</b> Acting like one, they fire before the cutpurses can react and overwhelm them in a matter of minutes, getting the bandits to beg for their lives. The taste of victory is dampened by how effortless it was to fool the crew, and they regain the ship with sour moods.","802418":"<b>Your sailors are defeated without difficulty.</b> The members of this crew are not fighters to begin with and their lack of ability shows in their poor coordination, whereas the bandits' organization is almost military-like. They suppress your sailors without a second thought, and the rare survivors are left to plod back to their ship.","802419":"The thugs watch as your crew empties their pockets.","802420":"Accept","802421":"Cancel","802422":"<b>You trade several goods against safe passage.</b> Trade is a strong word for this parody of consent, and your sailors feel ridiculed. They blame themselves for having believed in these tall tales of pirate treasures and leave with a little less belief in the extraordinary.","802423":"<b>What the crew offers is far from enough.</b> The old woman barely glances at the goods presented to her before flicking her wrist, triggering a rain of bullets onto the sailors. When she snaps her fingers to signal the end of the assault, your would-be adventurers are either wounded or dead. The survivors drag themselves back to the ship and rumours of treasures can never excite them again.","802424":"<b>Tales of pirate treasures belong to another century.</b> Your crew ignores the pleading woman and leave to spend the night in the ship, their dreams filled with fantasies of glittering jewels and untold fortunes. When they depart at dawn, there is a longing in their eyes.","802426":"Wood Keeper","802427":"<b>The indigenous village is filled with food but deserted.</b> After a smooth beaching on the shore, the crew enters the camp of wooden huts: there they find numerous fruits arranged in neat and symmetric piles, and their dried-meat regimen make them eye the fresh food with envy. Not a single villager is in sight.","802428":"Try to guess the meaning of the food's peculiar arrangement","802429":"Send a party to look for the missing villagers","802430":"Take the food quickly and leave with it","802431":"<b>The patterns of the offerings converge to a hut.</b> The crew follows the lines of fruits to the biggest hut, where they find a massive statue of wood lying in the dust. Its weathered edges must have seen many generations.","802432":"<b>The crew shows little respect towards the offerings.</b> The sailors turn over and forage through the piles of fruits, looking for hints of logic in the strange setup. When the villagers appear, drawn by the noise, they are baffled by the mess and immediately draw spears.","802433":"<b>What is happening here is not of God's realm.</b> The crew progresses through the village, too obsessed with the hypnotic patterns of offerings to see the spears coming. Villagers pour from the surrounding woods, hooting and screaming and assailing, and the sailors flee back to the ship in a frenzied panic. They leave before all could it back onboard.","802434":"Address the statue for lack of another representative","802435":"Lift the statue back up","802436":"Leave this cursed place","802437":"<b>The praying crew is rewarded with a new path.</b> Several sailors bow down to the statue, in a awkward but respectful manner. The only man able to look directly at the wooden figure notices that the hut's panels behind the statue, which he could have sworn were a solid wall, are not fully closed. Their illusory arrangement cleverly hid a path leading into the woods.","802438":"<b>The statue doesn't react to any prayer.</b> A sailor, cross necklace in hand, approaches the wooden figure and mumbles. A salute. An improvised prayer. After a long and unnerving silence, he turns to his mates and confirms that the statue is not answering. Several men utter nervous laughs.","802439":"Piece together the clues to understand the village's ritual","802440":"Explore the woods surrounding the hut","802441":"Reject the invitation and leave","802442":"<b>Your anthropologist retraces the exact steps of the ritual.</b> To appease their god, probably after the wooden statue fell, the villagers staged a path, probably with the fruits, to lead the god to a prize befitting its anger, probably in this dead trunk right behind the hut. The expert plunges her hand in the bark and retrieves an amulet of woven leaves and fruits. The crew takes it upon itself to make amulet and offerings disappear, confirming that the spirits are appeased.","802443":"<b>The crew's careful exploration lands a wondrous find.</b> In the trunk of a tree standing right behind the hut, they find an intricate amulet made of vines and fruits which glistens like a jewel. Marveling at their lucky discovery and entering endless debates to guess the meaning of what they saw, they help themselves to the fresh fruits and leave the village.","802444":"<b>Nothing of interest is found.</b> The sailors enjoy the beautiful flora, wondering what secrets could hide behind the village's strange appearance. They cannot help but think they have missed something and leave with some of the fresh fruits as a consolation prize.","802445":"<b>They will have none of this mystical nonsense.</b> The crew hurries away from the wooden figure and focuses on picking a good amount of food before heading back onboard. They know where their priorities are and ignore the unanswered questions that linger among them.","802446":"<b>The statue is successfully pulled back up.</b> It is even more impressive in its original position and dominates the room. Sunrays pierce through the hut's roof and fall on the statue, highlighting its uncanny shape and smearing its shadow on the back entrance of the hut.","802447":"<b>The statue doesn't budge.</b> As many men as hands can fit on the wooden figure surround the statue and attempt to lift it, to no avail. A sailor wonders if the thing wasn't carved from a standing tree with roots still holding it in place.","802451":"<b>They will have none of this mystical nonsense.</b> The crew hurries away from the wooden figure and focuses on picking a good amount of food before heading back onboard. They know where their priorities are and ignore the unanswered questions that linger among them.","802452":"Draw swords and brace for the assault","802453":"Do not attack and attempt an apology","802454":"<b>The crew acts as a well-oiled and heartless machine.</b> Years of military training and fighting together make the villagers' assault look puny in comparison, and the attackers are repelled and slaughtered - less than a handful manages to escape. The sailors collect what fruit hasn't been squashed during the fight, and leave without a second thought.","802455":"<b>It's a rout.</b> The crew ruins its formation when the villagers attack, and men scatter in all directions save for a line of headstrong sailors. They manage to repel the attackers and pay their unpredictable success with their lives. When those who fled climb back aboard the ship, they carry stolen supplies and the bodies of their fallen protectors.","802456":"<b>The sailors manage to communicate through signs and gesticulations.</b> Two men put in extra effort to mime their hunger and delight at the sight of the fruit piles, rubbing their bellies and humming eating sounds. The villagers answer in a perfectly intelligible language and their laughter follows the crew as it leaves for the ship, supplies in hand.","802457":"<b>The crew raises their hands and withdraws.</b> A village elder drops the tip of his spear to the ground and the warriors around him do the same. They do not blink as they survey the crew's retreat. Slowly, carefully, without abrupt movement, the sailors walk backward, out of the village, and into the ship.","802458":"<b>Few sailors manage to keep it together.</b> The most resolute raise their hands before the armed villagers, who in turn raise their spears and hoot. The crew breaks in response, groups of terrified men fleeing in all directions and getting skewered by the villagers' lances. Those who did not run are spared and sent back to the ship.","802461":"<b>A watchful lookout spots the villagers before they attack.</b> The crew is warned and the men have more than enough time to get ready to welcome their armed hosts: they prey onto them and not a single sailor is lost. The villagers who surrender are left alive and the crew accepts several supplies against their magnanimity.","802462":"<b>The villagers are found as they attack.</b> A lookout spots the attackers as they run towards the village, and he barely has the time to warn the crew before the warriors dive onto them.","802463":"<b>The villagers find the sailors before they are found.</b> As the extended absence of the lookouts starts to worry the crew, ballots of canvas roll from the woods: presents containing the heads of the missing men. Hooting sounds emerge from the trees and rise in power as the men run away in terror before their invisible assailants.","802468":"<b>The crew's carelessness allows the attack.</b> As soon as one of the sailors touches the fruits, a hooting shout resonates around the village and men and women dressed in sticks, creepers and vines appear around the crew. Arrows and spears rain on the sailors who scatter in a panic and flee to the ship, empty-handed and badly wounded.","802470":"The Storm","802472":"<b>This tempest is beyond anything you have ever faced.</b> The smell of salt is everywhere. The freezing water pierces everyone. The winds and waves hit your ship with impossible violence, making the vessel groan and tremble with each new strike, the air so full of sea-spray one could drown in it. Is there anything mere humans could do in the face of such godlike wrath?","802474":"Pray that the usual method will work and reef the sails","802475":"Frenzied measures for frenzied times: open all sails and ride the storm","802476":"Use the steam engines to carefully follow the trough of waves","802477":"Overwork the steam engines to boldly escape the storm","802478":"<b>Trust in your habits pays.</b> Years of executing the same maneuvers have ingrained them into your crew's instincts. The sailors reef sail after sail despite the poor visibility - they do not need sight, for they are guided by the invisible hand of practice. Only the fore and aft sails are left to flail in the wind to keep a semblance of control over the ship.","802479":"<b>What is faith in yourself against the rage of the heavens?</b> The sails trash against their mast, escaping the hands of your sailors as they desperately try to reef them. The freezing rain becomes hail, and the crew's strength melts under the relentless pounding. About half the sails are secured when lightning booms in the distance.","802481":"Sail through the storm","802482":"Wait for the storm to pass","802483":"<b>The vessel emerges from the storm, unscathed.</b> The barren masts of your ship part the tempest as the crew maneuver its jib sails and the spanker, ridiculously small pieces of cloth in the face of the storm's fury. Still, the maneuver magnifies the importance of these sails and masterfully skirts the storm, leaving the curtain of rain just as lightning begins to strike. Entranced, the crew contemplates how they managed to defy such a grand power.","802484":"<b>Waiting would have been a better option.</b> If the force of training helped your crew while reefing the sails, it doesn't reveal how to navigate the furious tempest. Sailing with nothing but the jib sails and spanker is a feat no one on your ship is capable of. The vessel is tossed about helplessly until the storm decides to calm down.","802486":"Order the crew to finish reefing the sails","802487":"Maneuver with what sails you have left","802488":"<b>Just in time!</b> The lieutenants' preaching hits the sailors harder than the hail itself, and the crew pours their last drops of effort into reefing the remaining sail. As they finish attaching the spanker, the full strength of the tempest hits the ship. To the relief of the crew the reefed sails take no damage, but the ship lurches helplessly, carried by the whims of the storm until it finally calms down.","802489":"<b>There's no courage in these cowards.</b> Despite the repeated calls of the lieutenants and the emergency of the situation, the sailors stay frozen in the face of the thunderstorm, awed mice before a famished cat.","802490":"The distant storm or your immediate flogging: their choice","802491":"None other than the Lord can choose our path now","802492":"<b>The threat works.</b> The perspective of a flogging somewhat outweighs the menace of the thunderstorm, and the sailors resume their work in a panic. The sails are reefed and secured right before the heart of the storm crashes into your ship. Letting the tempest haul you through the ocean is not a pleasant experience, but at least the sailboat didn't take any damage.","802493":"<b>The threat is not only weak, but unwarranted.</b> Distraught by the storm and unable to gather their wits, your lieutenants cannot catch the crew's attaention. The sailors are too immersed in saving their individual lives to mind orders, and even moreso when they are given without conviction. Your ship is swallowed by the tempest, chewed and grinded and spat. Its skeletal remains drift away from the storm.","802496":"<b>Your prayers are heard.</b></br>\"A thousand may fall at your side, </br>Ten thousand at your right hand, </br>But it will not come near you. </br>You will only observe with your eyes </br>And see the punishment of the wicked.\"</br>As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.","802497":"<b>The thunderstorm hits your ship with full force.</b> Call it divine punition or pure coincidence, but the tempest gathers around the vessel and hell begins. Lightning strikes the masts and tears through the sails, igniting brief fires that are immediately doused by the hail. The deck is water, the ship is a wave - and it crashes against the sea, again and again. When at least sunrays bless the sailboat, its shape is torn and mangled.","802498":"<b>To safety!</b> Maneuvering with half the sails while facing oversized waves, pounding hail and incoming lightning is as difficult as it sounds. And yet the crew does it. Relying not on the sails, but on the ship's bilge keel and its keel-protecting apron, they spear through the wind without being driven sideways away from it. The boat leaps in the trough of waves, pushed by the raging force of the elements, offering the most resistance it can offer - until, at last, the tempest is left behind.","802499":"<b>A close call.</b> Navigating with so little sails proves more difficult than expected and the proximity of the thunderstorm makes the sea even wilder. The ship rolls among the gigantic waves, sailed more than it sails, and it is lifted and shifted by the whims of the tempest. The crew's maneuvers equal to choosing which less terrible wave they wish to crash into. When the storm recedes, the damage is somewhat acceptable.","802500":"<b>Too slow.</b> The crew's skills are limited to classic sailing, perhaps to sailing in a bit of bad weather, but not to storms of this magnitude. Not to a ship with half its sails reefed and the other half flailing in the gale. Ignoring the urgency of the freed sails, the sailors try to maneuver the ship and manage to present its full flank to the waves. The tempest gladly takes the offering. It hurls the ship into its midst, tears both sails and men from it, and spews the remains in calmer seas.","802501":"<b>Riding the wild wind isn't dangerous enough for your crew.</b> In a display of utter complete control over the ship, they pull it to ride an invisible corridor of safe passage among the waves. What gale should have torn the sails apart fills them and makes the sailboat dance with a majesty at least as grand as the storm itself. Instead of leaving the tempest, the crew rides it until it calms down on its own, exhausted from carrying its new masters.","802502":"<b>A move as wasteful as it was risky.</b> Meek doesn't even begin to describe your sailors' ability: they deploy the sails in an incoherent manner, letting the wind take hold of the ship. The vessel yaws to one side, then to other, its rudder barely in contact with the water. A wave grabs a sailor and runs away with him. Any more of this and the whole crew will follow!","802503":"Time the anchor's release to counterbalance the ship","802504":"Fill the bottom of the hold to keep it steady","802507":"<b>A bold move!</b> Releasing the anchor right as the ship reaches an upright position and begins to yaw again is the perfect timing to stop the chaotic rolling. The sailboat protests against the maneuver, trembling under the insistence of the waves, but obediently follows your crew's demands as they can finally steer it away from the storm. Unnerved but alive, the sailors agree that they have seen and done enough risk-taking for the day.","802508":"<b>A move too bold.</b> Timing the anchor's release to the yawing of the ship takes more competence and composure than your crew has: the iron cross is dropped as the ship rolls to the opposite side of the anchor's hawsehole and, instead of driving the ship back to a steady position, the anchor grinds against the flank and tears planks and railings as it falls. The waves do the rest. When the storm finally recedes, the ship is adrift, its flank gutted.","802509":"<b>Safe and sound.</b> Ignoring the battering rain and navigating the pitching deck with skill, the sailors organize a human chain to store all upper decks goods in the depths of the ship. The temporary ballast, accompanied by the human weight of the sailors, manages to lower the waterline and quells the ship's rolls. Hidden in the hull and unable to do anymore for their ship, the crew must wait for the storm to calm down on its own.","802510":"<b>Mayhem.</b> Disheartened by the enormity of the task, the sailors hardly listen to their lieutenants. Four crew members attempt to follow orders and unfasten the deck's supplies, which roll away from them and swing through the deck as the ship continues to pitch, knocking down sailors and pushing them overboard, breaking the ship's railings and toppling its weakened masts. When the sun emerges, it reveals the emaciated silhouette of a ghost ship.","802511":"<b>Slow and steady.</b>Maybe too slow? Careful maneuvers maintain your ship under favourable winds and keep the menace of transverse waves at bay, but the storm still rages and, worse, it keeps up with your pace.","802512":"<b>You would have been better off with a windjammer.</b> Navigating the ship through the storm proves trickier than expected, and the navigators' lack of familiarity with steam ships shows as they rely on the sails to maneuver, despite the ship's peculiar lack of a middle mast. It doesn't take long for the ship to protest against the poor handling. It yaws, and a loud rumble erupts from the hull: the ballast is unfastened!","802513":"Overheat the engines to outrun the storm","802514":"Maintain a steady pace and let the storm push you off-tracks","802515":"<b>A power stronger than the elements themselves.</b> Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit, the screw propeller moving beyond what human sight can perceive and propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.","802516":"<b>You should have been more patient.</b> The crew cannot manage such a brusque change of pace, and their meager knowledge of the machinery is not enough to demand so much from the engines without paying an equivalent price. The ship vaults away from the storm in a cacophony of complaining metal and agonizing devices - when at least the tempest is gone, the engines require your immediate attention and repairs.","802521":"Fasten the ballast back into place","802522":"Fight the pitching with a bold attempt at facing the wind","802523":"<b>Your sailors are unperturbed by the pitching.</b> They descend into the hull and avoid the rolling basalt stones with ease, tying the ballast back in place, stone by stone, knot by knot. They emerge bruised and exhausted, but the ship is now steady enough to wait for the storm to pass without any risk of broaching.","802524":"<b>Too heavy, too dangerous.</b> Your sailors are ill-prepared to handle the massive basalt stones that act as ballast. They try to secure the stones in place but the ship continues to pitch and their footing is unsteady and the rocks are so, so heavy. A sudden yaw sends the basalt rolling into them and your sailors are knocked down and crushed like clay figures. There is nothing more to be done but wait for the ire of the tempest to pass.","802525":"<b>Indeed, this is a windjammer.</b> Navigating the steam ship like a good old sailboat, the navigators rely on the sails alone to steady the erratic movements, and strain the rudder to face a full frontal wind. This is fearless! The gale hits the wet sails with all its might, inflating them to their utmost limit, and the sudden force breaks the pitching. The navigators immediately seize the opportunity to restart the engines and escape the storm under the delighted clamor of the crew.","802526":"<b>Disaster.</b> Proving once more how unable they are to navigate the ship, the navigators attempt what should never be attempted: go against the wind. As the ship twirls the transversal gale strikes it with full force, transforming the yaw into a full-length broaching. The masts plunge into the sea, and there is no more up or down, no more sky or deck. Everything is water. When it drains away, allowing the ship to sway back into position, there is no trace left of the sailors taken by the storm.","802527":"<b>A power stronger than the elements themselves.</b> Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit, the screw propeller moving beyond what human sight can perceive and propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.","802528":"<b>The delicate machinery is handled brutishly.</b> Assuming that the engines heat is directly proportional to the ship's speed, the engineer overheats the steamer and bring the boiler way over its capacity. The temperature rises and the pressure swells and the metal quivers, until one of the engine explodes, killing the engineer on the spot.","802529":"Attempt to use the remaining engine without your engineer","802530":"Shut off the engines and rely on your sails","802531":"<b>An unexpected turnaround.</b> A sailor steps forward: she's spent the trip observing the engineer, she says, and thinks she can handle the machinery. The lack of other volunteers, frightened by the engineer's death, leaves her as the only candidate. She handles the remaining engine with a notable if amateurish skill and the steam ship emerges from the storm in one piece. Still, several sailors whisper about the ill luck of letting a woman save them.","802533":"<b>From bad to worse.</b> The sailors have even less skill than the engineer who, let us insist on this point, died while trying to practise his specialty. The crew tries to push this thing and pull that other thing. The pieces of metal are kicked to the best of the crew's abilities until the air pump's valve bursts open, filling the entire room with burning steam and forcing the sailors outside. The valve must be closed, and a volunteer offers to face the miniature hell.","802534":"Forget engineering, and hope the Lord will protect the volunteer","802536":"Insist on using your crafting wits, and protect him yourself","802537":"<b>If not skill, at least courage is rewarded.</b> The volunteer rushes inside the engine room to close the leaking valve, screaming a Glory Be as the steam broils his skin. Both steam and storm recede once the valve is slammed closed, and the crew can take its time repairing the abused machinery. The volunteer spends the rest of the trip preaching the Lord's grace and his incessant sermon make the other sailors regret the tempest and its terrifying shrieks.","802538":"<b>Hell indeed.</b> Whether the volunteer lacked faith or the Lord lacked attention, it is only for Him to know. The man enters the engine room and can hardely touch the leaking valve before the steam devours him, large blisters feeding on his flesh while the whistling valve cover his sceams. There is no distinguishing the man's agony from the machinery's cries, and the door is hurriedly sealed shut. The inhumane shrieks continue to resound through the ship for the rest of the trip.","802539":"<b>The least bad of your worst.</b> The volunteer penetrates the engine room wrapped in layers of wet cloths as the crew ventilates the room by quickly opening and closing its door, avoiding the steam with damp armors of their own. The man manages to close the valve and the rest of the steam is evacuated in the same ridiculously plain manner. The immediate danger is avoided, and the crew wisely decides to avoid any more risk-taking and wait for the storm to end on its own.","802540":"<b>Don't you know when to stop?</b> The sailor covers himself in damp cloths and enters the engine room, where the steam contaminates the wet protection with insufferable heat. He springs from the room covered in blisters, a monster of molten skin which howls agony beyond human comprehension, its outcry echoed by the tempest. The steam follows and burns all sailors within its grasp, taking delight in the stolen flesh until it finally recedes, replete thanks to the stubborness of the crew.","802541":"<b>Audacious!</b> Abandoning the steam engines, the crew focuses its efforts on using all sails available on the ship. The sailors have may not have faced tempests this grand before, but they have crossed seas and braved oceans aboard all kinds of vessels, and navigation is in their blood. The wind is faced and the waves ignored and the steering wheel locked into place, allowing the ship to stay steady until the storm passes. Not the most natural solution for a steam ship, but a good display of skill.","802542":"<b>Reckless!</b> Attempting to face the tempest without the ship's main power source is folly, and the crew cannot handle the safety sails as well as they imagined. They try to face the waves to break their momentum, but the ship's mishandling lets it drift and offers its flanks to the tempest. When the sun pierces the clouds, it reveals a spectacle of lacerated sails, flooded supplies, and disgruntled sailors.","802543":"<b>The storm passes.</b> With the sails reefed to avoid damage, the sailors have only themselves to care about: they bury under the deck in wet bundles, shivering under the biting cold of the unremitting downpour. The endless wait is dispelled by a timid sun, and the expedition can finally resume.","802544":"<b>A negligible change of course.</b> Letting the storm push your ship as it pleases upsets the most hot-headed sailors, but those with an actual brain upstairs appreciate the prudent approach. When the storm recedes, the ship's slight change of course takes a full week to be corrected - a decent trade-off for your safety.","802546":"Apostasy","802547":"<b>Little cohabitation can be found among believers and apostates.</b> To ensure the diversity of your crew's skills, your sailors were recruited regardless of their origins or beliefs, and your lieutenants now wonder if this was a mistake. After weeks of lasting rainstorms, the most devout sailors raise their voice: this constant punishment is a sign of the divine, testifying to His obvious displeasure in the heresy onboard. Zealots speak of riot.","802548":"Consult The Illiad on the matter","802549":"Consult The Odyssey on the matter","802550":"Consult the Norse Sagas on the matter","802551":"Consult the Egyptian tales on the matter","802552":"Consult an ancient romance on the matter","802553":"Consult Skaldic poetry on the matter","802554":"Convince the apostates to come back to the light","802555":"Convince the zealots into accepting their differences","802556":"<b>The Old Norse has much wisdom to share.</b></br>“Men brave and generous live the best lives, seldom will they sorrow; then there are fools, afraid of everything, who grumble instead of giving.”</br>Snorri's Edda is a gentle but firm reminder to your sailors that their grievances are shallow and foolish. No agreement is voiced that night, but all know that an understanding is born.","802557":"<b>The Odyssey's wisdom seeps into your sailors' souls.</b></br>\"For a friend with an understanding heart is worth no less than a brother.\"</br>Gathered around the first mate for an improvised reading session, the sailors can't ignore how the tale of friendship reminds them of their own adventures, of their own mistakes, of their own companions. Difference in faith is a detail. Their unity is what prevails.","802558":"<b>Mythical tales give a lesson to your crew.</b></br>\"Come then, let us give each other glorious presents, so that any of the Achaians or Trojans may say of us: 'These two fought each other in heart-consuming hate, then joined with each other in close friendship.'\"</br>Hector's speech reminds your sailors of the values that bond them in this expedition: thrill, friendship, discovery, not anger nor fratricide over different beliefs. They sheepishly make up.","802559":"<b>The epic poem puts your crew's petty fights in perspective.</b></br>\"The battle continued from day to day; and all they who fell, and all the swords that lay on the field of battle, and all the shields, became stone.\"</br>The crew itself is petrified as it hangs onto the first mate's every word while he progresses through the poems of the Skáldskaparmál. The tale transports them to a time where pride had a greater value than faith, and their anger goes out.","802560":"<b>Your sailors bond in their love of a great tale.</b></br>“For love will cure him that is sick, and rouse him that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it will instruct.\"</br>The first mate closes his novel, leaving the crew to ponder over the fate of Daphnis and Chloe. The sailors, moved by their love, find themselves wiping tears over the story. The shared emotion gives them a common ground during which they can pretend their differences do not exist.","802561":"<b>There's a mystifying wisdom in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.</b></br>Although no exact quote can be extracted from the detailed drawings, the translator's work in dissecting the Ptolemaic manuscript manages to build texts akin to the original meaning. Your sailors' trivial quarrels reveal their narrow-minded nature as the first mate unravels tales of fratricide and weighed souls. The tensions loosen as much as they can.","802562":"<b>There is relief in promised forgiveness.</b></br>\"For the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him.\"</br>The priest's words are filled with his own altruism and make the promise ring true. The crew agrees, albeit awkwardly, to put aside their differences and engage in a calm exchange over their beliefs - the anger is quelled, but the heresy remains.","802563":"<b>Your priest's ideals are far from peaceful.</b></br>\"If your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' your hand shall be first against him to put him to death!\"</br>The menace embodies what the apostates criticise: a blind upholding of beliefs at the cost of your own humanity. The zealous priest is found hanged the next day - a warning to all who would chastise one's faith or lack of it.","802564":"<b>Your diplomat finds the right words.</b></br>\"God is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere.\"</br>The quote is surprising coming from the woman of law, who manages to put aside her own beliefs to show respect for the zealots' faith. The crew listens intently and all agree that the expedition might be the occasion to discover and appreciate the beliefs of others, despite a sustained atmosphere of skepticism.","802565":"<b>The diplomat finds no common ground with the zealots.</b></br>\"When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion!\"</br>The argument is as wrong as it is insulting. Does the man not think that sailors embarked on the expedition for more than their pay? His lack of respect rouses the anger of the zealots, drawing the attention away from the apostates. Nothing more than a shift in the target of their hatred.","802567":"A Fistful of Doubloons","802568":"<b>The ship's coffers have been emptied!</b> Your purser knew these new recruits had a wicked air about them. As soon as the ship reached port and the sailors were allowed some rest, the three landsmen merged with the local crowd and disappeared and with them went weeks of pay. The theft was planned in every minute detail - your sailors have been robbed by professionals.","802570":"Track the thieves down","802571":"Let them be","802572":"<b>The fleeing footprints are easily found.</b> The tracks of the thieves' limping leader stand out in the dust. The grazing light of the setting sun highlights the path for your huntsmen and leads them away from the town and closer to its river, where tracks disappear in the water. The hills rise sharply on the other side.","802573":"<b>No tracks are found.</b> The bustling harbour and the late evening insist on hiding the thieves' tracks. Your sailors are not skilled enough to pick up the faint trail inside the town itself, but they might have better luck around its outskirts.","802574":"Look for a ford to cross on foot","802575":"Create a raft to cross the river","802576":"<b>A safe passage!</b> The crew's expertise shines as they rapidly spot a shallow part in the river and cross it without much inconvenience. They go up the sharp hill of the opposite bank and happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew needs horses.","802577":"<b>Your crew finds no guarantee of safe crossing.</b> The sailors quickly get tired of the senseless search: the river's depth cannot be appraised by their untrained eyes, and each segment of the water seems both deep and shallow. The crew is too reluctant to try its luck, and abandons its search, disgruntled.","802578":"Attempt to catch wild horses","802579":"Buy horses from the breeder","802580":"<b>The tamed horses easily catch up with your prey.</b> Your hunters lasso the wild animals and break them before launching them through the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves' horses, whose speed is no match for wild ones. Your riders surround them and the menace of their number and drawn pistols hushes any resistance. The sailors, satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.","802581":"<b>Your sailors are not made to catch land animals.</b> The hunt ends in failure, the most your crew saw of a wild horse being weathered tracks in the dry roads. Instead of leading your hunters to a herd, the tracks drive them to a run-down town of wooden buildings -several houses and a single saloon-, its lanterns brightening with the growing darkness. Night is well on its way and tracking the thieves seems almost impossible now.","802582":"Ask the locals for help","802584":"Avoid trouble and simply give up","802585":"<b>The locals agree to help.</b> Your diplomat carefully brings the subject of thieves to a man of imposing authority, the sheriff in charge of the small town. The modus operandi is familiar to him: a local gang is famous for their sneaking around foreign businessmen, but he never would have imagined they'd be so bold as to rob a ship. If the robbery was today, he says, the thieves are sure to come and celebrate at the saloon tonight.","802586":"<b>Your crew is held responsible for the deserters' actions.</b> Instead of probing around to get an idea of the runaways' reputation, your diplomat immediately asks about the thieves. The men are well-known in the worst way and the locals are shocked to hear your crew hosted them, regardless of the theft - the sailors are forced to leave when surrounded by stern-looking gunslingers. The track ends here. More than money, your sailors have lost morale.","802587":"Wait on the town's balconies, ready for an ambush","802588":"Wait at the saloon, ready for a fight","802589":"<b>A clean job.</b> As soon as the thieves come into sight, your sailors stealthily lay their firearms on the rail guards of balconies and aim and fire in rapid succession. The shots resonate through the quiet town: one shot, one permanent sleeper. When the sound and smell of gunshots settle down, the sheriff salutes your crew's help in getting rid of local pests and ensures the sailors that their reputation will be made known through the West.","802590":"<b>Rout.</b> Your sailors fire as soon as the gang comes into view, taking little time to aim and even less to observe their targets. The bullets graze past the thieves and upset their horses, who rear and jump before running away with their riders. A night drizzle starts falling and soon drowns their tracks. That's as far as the crew's efforts, notable but inefficient, can go.","802591":"<b>Honour and wages are retrieved.</b>When the gang slams the saloon's doors open, the place is devoid of its usual chirpy atmosphere. Moon rays disclose the presence of your crew, sat on every possible chair and table and stair step and already reaching for their guns. The fight is brief. Your sailors submerge the thieves and drag them outside, roped and gagged, and salute the sheriff before heading back to the ship with the satisfaction of a job well done.","802592":"<b>Your crew is no match for the criminals.</b> When the gang barges into the saloon, the sailors are still arguing over how to handle the fighting in such a closed space. The fight is short-lived. Your sailors lack the rough training and ability of their opponents and can barely fling insults at them, even less punches. The beaten crew is thrown outside and scampers away from the town - very aware of how lucky they are to still be alive.","802593":"<b>So much effort for such a meagre reward.</b> Feeling the pressure of unseen stares, your crew avoids the shady town and backs away to the harbour city and their ship. Better to decide on your own to withdraw than to be forced to, the sailors tell themselves. Frustration nibbles their thoughts as they set sail.","802594":"You can choose either to rent or buy a mount.","802595":"Confirm","802596":"Cancel","802597":"<b>The animals catch up with your prey in no time!</b> In a flurry of dust and whinnying, the mounts assail the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves, perched atop horses already exhausted from their mishandling. Your riders surround them and the menace of their number and drawn pistols hushes any resistance. The sailors, satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.","802598":"<b>Your crew will make do on its own.</b> The price for the withered mares reeks of scam and your sailors refuse to pay a single pound for the animals. Their observations might be influenced by the light weight of their purses.","802599":"<b>A safe passage!</b> The raft is basic but sturdy, and it crosses the river without losing so much as a plank. The crew boards the opposite bank safely and climbs the hill rising right beyond it. On the other side, they happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew needs horses.","802600":"<b>The raft can't even float.</b> Your sailors bind logs and dead branches together, binding them with sturdy knots but little knowledge of how to actually assemble the ropes. The raft's apparent stability tricks the builders into climbing onto it, and the raft swirls over the river, wobbling under the weight of sailors and the pressure of the current, before breaking and diving straight into the icy water. Few sailors can be rescued from the wreckage.","802601":"Keep searching","802602":"Stop these futile efforts","802603":"<b>Finally, tracks to follow!</b> Amidst the numerous footprints left by your sailors, your best huntsmen manage to find the dotted lines left in the dust by the fleeing thieves. There's no mistaking the bent pattern of their limping leader. The prints waddle to the nearest river, where they fade in the water.","802604":"<b>Isn't this humiliation enough?</b> Your crew keeps foraging through the outskirts of town, but they still cannot find any tracks.","802605":"<b>Your purser protests but the decision is final.</b> Going after the thieves in a territory they seem to know by heart while the crew itself is in foreign territory? The risk will not be taken. As the ship sails away from the harbour and the villains it hosts, your sailors mourn the plundered funds.","802606":"<b>Your purser protests but the decision is final.</b> Going after the thieves in a territory they seem to know by heart while the crew itself is in foreign territory? The risk will not be taken. As the ship sails away from the harbour and the villains it hosts, your sailors mourn the plundered funds.","802607":"Get on your horses","802609":"The Mountain Maw","802610":"<b>Your sailors face the mountain without a map.</b> After a race from guide to guide through the depths of the mountain range, the crew finds itself devoid of chaperon: the guide supposed to take them on this last trip didn't show up at the agreed time. Forget what initial goal the exploration followed. Getting out of the snow-whipped peak is the only priority.","802611":"Traverse the mountain on your own","802612":"Go back on your tracks","802613":"<b>Your navigators make do without a guide.</b> They take note of landmarks as they progress, relying on their compasses to follow a straight direction, staying put during the night despite the dwindling supplies. At long last they find a stream of melted snow and follow it downhill to the feet of the mountain. The crew survived, but it was a tough effort.","802614":"<b>A guide would have been helpful.</b> Your sailors navigate the mountain paths to the best of their ability, which is not enough. The narrow roads disappear under the snow mist and they branch around the skeletal trees, spreading your crew across their ramifications. When the explorers reach a decent camping ground and count their numbers, five of them are missing.","802618":"Go forward, leaving marks for the lost sailors to follow","802619":"Go back, and look for the missing sailors","802620":"<b>The feet of the mountain, at last.</b> The crew progresses step by step, testing the frozen snow for gaps and leaving piles of stones for the lost sailors to follow. Building the landmarks takes time but it helps avoiding any backtracking. The main group is soon joined by the missing sailors, disgruntled to have been left behind despite the crew's efforts at guiding them, and they reach the end of the mountain range in silence, unable to express their relief.","802621":"<b>The explorers get more lost with each passing day.</b> They venture deep into the mountain and quickly abandon the idea of leaving marks for the lost sailors, too concerned for their own survival. The frost solidifies their clothes, steals their toes and rots their food.","802622":"Follow a stream of melted snow running downhill","802623":"Force your way through the mounds of powder snow","802624":"Prioritise your supplies and look for food","802625":"<b>Your sailors manage to follow the stream to the mountain's feet.</b> The stream flows in and out of the frozen ground, playing hide and seek with the desperate crew. They are not the only ones using the trickle as a guide: just before reaching the plains below the mountain, they meet with the missing sailors as they quell their burning thirst in the meagre snow stream. It's unclear which of the two teams is the most pitiful, but all are alive.","802626":"<b>Where did they come from? Where should they go?</b> The melting snow splits into a web of entangled streams which buries under the ground and resurfaces without any apparent logic. The crew is taken by the illusion that the forest around them is flat and can no longer tell if they are climbing or descending. They split like the streams themselves, to each sailor their trickle, and like the streams not all of them find the feet of the mountain.","802627":"<b>The sailors draw strength from their last resources.</b> They ignore the colossal distance they have to cross and focus on small milestones instead. Two steps to that tree. Three steps to that rock. The snow parts as they advance, drawing dark trenches which run across the pure white mantle and reach the feet of the mountain. The crew stumbles and falls in relief when they realize they made it out alive.","802628":"<b>The sailors are too weakened by the cold.</b> They dig through the powder snow which collapses on them without revealing any safe path. Their endurance crippled by the frost, they abandon the task and try to focus on less demanding options.","802629":"<b>The crew extends its stay in the cold to gather supplies.</b> Game is scarce and hunting takes time. However, the food makes for a decent meal and the smell of roasted hare fills the sailors' stomachs almost as well as the meat itself. The cooking fire's lights spreads through the forest at night and beckons the missing sailors. Reunited, the crew avoids talking about abandoning their companions and they leave the mountain in silence.","802630":"<b>Your hunters fall prey to the mountain.</b> Animals' tracks sprinkle the fresh snow, but their owners are invisible, hidden in holes and burrows. The hunters are unused to such terrain. As they progress through the forest, discussing where snares could be the most efficient, the frozen ground suddenly breaks under them and a handful of sailors dives into a deep fault.","802631":"<b>The missing sailors are found, and with them an exit.</b> The idea of losing their companions pushes the hunters to persevere. Broken twigs, brushed moss, mud splashes: everything is a hint. They follow the trail to a crossing and find the lost sailors, who welcome them heartily: they have found a beaten path which leads straight to the feet of the mountain! That they believed in the others and waited for them is a reward in and of itself.","802632":"<b>The fresh snow hides the dangers underneath.</b> A powdery white covers everything in sight and the skies melt into the ground, hiding the horizon. The hunters advance on instinct, unable to look for hints of their previous passage. They find the missing sailors by encountering their fate: the frozen ground breaks under their weight. The thin crust of ice hid a fault! Three of the lost men are down there, and two hunters joined them.","802633":"Pull the sailors from the fault, at the risk of falling","802634":"Abandon them and continue downhill","802637":"<b>The rescue comes at the price of their remaining strength.</b> It takes ten sailors to get one man out of the fault: three to pull, six to hold and one to keep an eye on the trembling layer of ice. The snow weighs them down, pushing when they pull, hissing when they call out. When the last sailor is hauled from the rift, both rescuers and rescued are broken. They drag themselves downhill and manage to leave the clutch of the mountain.","802638":"<b>The ordeal is much bigger than your sailors.</b> They launch ropes into the rift but the slippery walls of ice cannot be climbed. The rescuers attempt to haul the others up, and they plant their feet into the ground, pulling and pulling and panting, their physical reserves long drained by the cold. As they fall to their knees and break their nails on the frozen hemp, the rift cracks and the mountain opens its mouth wide. The swallowed crew is never seen again.","802639":"<b>Salvation at the price of their humanity.</b> Ignoring the begging screams of their companions, the sailors make a large detour to avoid falling into the frozen rift. As they find a beaten path heading downhill, a sailor catches up to the group, panting: he admits to having thrown pickaxes and ropes down the fault. The crew congratulates him for his selflessness, and they pretend the deed was enough to ease their conscience.","802640":"The Mountain Maw 1.2.1","802642":"Blood, Oil, Tears and Sweat","802643":"<b>An overweight ship is easy prey for stormy waves.</b> The oil merchants your crew met at the last harbour paid good money for their cargo to be stored aboard your ship, but the weight isn't really something your vessel can handle. At the first signs of tempest winds and cutting waves, the unusual ballast makes your ship heel furiously.","802644":"Release the stern anchor to the sea floor","802645":"Improvise a sea anchor on the surface of the water","802646":"<b>Safe.</b> The cast-iron shank of the anchor plunges into the shifting waves with a large splash, the amount of chain being just right for it to take a good hold of the sea floor. The ship wobbles, washed by the waves and winds, but manages to stay put. The sailors simply wait for the storm to pass and hope the extra load will not cause any more problems.","802647":"<b>A miss - the crew should go hide in the lower decks.</b> The anchor is released, its chain unravelling by itself more than it is controlled, and the large iron cross reaches the bottom with too much play to properly grip the sea floor. As it becomes apparent the anchor will not be of any help, the lieutenants order all to descend into the bottom of the swinging ship - but the oil merchants refuse to leave the apparent safety of their upper cabins.","802648":"Take the time to present this solution as the best","802649":"Drug them to avoid losing any more time","802650":"<b>The loss of time was necessary.</b> Your lieutenants take the time to convince the merchants, detailing all available options one by one despite the increasingly high pressure from the waves and the rocking of the ship. Their stoicism more than their arguments convince the merchants of following orders, and they join the rest of the crew in the lower deck until the storm comes to pass.","802651":"<b>A loss of time.</b>Pressed by the emergency of the situation and unable to get their thoughts in order, your lieutenants cannot properly convince the merchants. As they begin to lose their nerve, the ship swerves and slams into the shore. Whistling winds invade the perforated hull and water seeps in their wake.","802652":"Repair the hole while the water is still pouring","802653":"Move the ballast to lift the hole above sea level","802654":"<b>Your crew is used to repairs in poor conditions.</b> Ignoring the swinging floor, the sailors focus on the hull, their legs deep into the pouring water. Drenched supplies float and sink around them as they plug the hole. The seal will not last long, but it should hold until the next harbour.","802655":"<b>Your crew's speed cannot match the water's.</b> Overwhelmed by the current and unable to prioritise their tasks or even shape a plan of the repairs, the sailors quickly abandon the idea of patching up the hull. They flee to the upper deck and brace themselves as the ship crashes on the shore, ripped apart. The repairs last for weeks.","802656":"<b>The forced instability protects the ship.</b> Your sailors huff and puff as they push the large sacks of basalt stones across the belly of the ship, progressively tipping the vessel's balance until its pierced flank leans away from the water. The ship is carefully led to the shore, where the crew can finally start repairs.","802657":"<b>A ludicrous plan.</b> Your sailors wheeze and gasp as they try to pull the basalt sacks, but their efforts are not enough to budge the ballast into place. The ship remains steady, allowing more and more water in and sinking with the intrusion. Several sailors drown, trapped between the deck's roof and the swirling currents, and their bodies cannot be evacuated before the storm calms down.","802658":"<b>Safe and drunk.</b> The merchants accept the liquid courage and drink its laced contents, falling asleep before they can finish their bottle. They're dragged to the lower deck with the rest of the crew and what supplies the sailors could carry, their combined weight counterbalancing the pounding of the waves. The storm soon calms down and leaves the crew to deal with the hangover of their passengers.","802659":"<b>Too weak.</b> The drinks your sailors offer to the merchants in an attempt to soothe their anger are far too poorly made to have any kind of impact on them. As they continue to struggle against your crew, a vivid growl resonates in the ship: it came too close to shore, and the reefs pierced your hull! Water starts to pour in the lower decks.","802660":"<b>The sea anchor works properly.</b> Your sailors bind planks with a docking line and lest the makeshift anchor with a ripped sail, before letting the construction drop into the waves. It sips the water in its cloth, bobbing with the sea, pulling against the water to increase its drag. Your ship gains enough stability to keep its broadside away from the waves and the crew, relieved, can wait for the storm to pass.","802661":"<b>The sea anchor sinks as soon as it touches the water.</b> The sailors tack together extra sails to try and assemble a sea anchor, but the ballooning cloths snap as soon as they're thrown into the waves. As the ship is pushed towards the shore the backwash gets more and more ample, until a rogue wave of ludicrous proportions rises above the sea. Your merchant passengers beg your crew to save them!","802662":"Face the wave head on","802664":"Throw the oil cargo overboard to calm the seas","802665":"<b>Fearless.</b> Despite the battering gale and clobbering currents, your crew manages to keep the ship straight and face the rogue wave head on. The wave crashes into your vessel with all its rage and natural power, but the straight prow cuts its fury in two and the ship avoids most of the damage - a rock among the waters. When the storm calms down, your crew focuses on the repairs and considers how exceptional their survival was.","802666":"<b>Too audacious.</b> The gusts of wind fill your sails and the frantic currents pull your hull, and your crew is way too untrained to keep their reins over the ship. Entailed by the sea's passion, the ship leaps and falls, dancing until the shore catches it and stops its mad waltz. The vessel's carcass stays still, water and bodies flowing from its bent silhouette.","802669":"<b>The water's anger dies out!</b> Moving the merchants aside with ease and dismissing their plea, your sailors heave the oil barrels over the railings and let their contents spill around the ship. The oil hugs the water and rolls over the waves, dissolving the wind's grip and slowing the water's movement. The threat of the waves is no more, but the merchants' trust and cargo were lost in the process.","802670":"<b>Their greed overcomes your strength.</b> The sailors try to reason, then to force the merchants into giving up their precious oil, but your crew is weak in both body and spirit while the merchants have built their fortunes on hard-headedness. Long after the ship has been hit, crushed, and stranded, the merchants's cadavers are found lying on the shore's pebbles, still clutching their barrels of cargo.","802672":"The Runaway","802673":"<b>The local authorities are looking for the refugee you have taken in.</b> A man in rags offers you his services in a harbour, arguing that he'd do any odd job for food and a chance at joining your crew. Unlike other temporary hires, he grows onto your sailors, filling in wherever there is work, catching onto the ship's spirit and disputing debates over the expedition's course. His skills testify to a life beyond that of a common sailor, but your crew respects his secrecy. As your ship leaves the harbour, a patrolling warship stops it: they are looking for a political dissident and the description matches your new recruit.","802675":"\"We have never seen him.\"","802676":"\"Is it a fight you are looking for?\"","802677":"\"You have never seen us.\"","802678":"\"Here is the man you are looking for.\"","802679":"<b>Your crew presents a coherent lie.</b> Have anyone anywhere seen anybody? They inspect the picture of the runaway, speculate on hiding places, rummage through the cargo while the refugee buries under the supplies, unseen. The pretence of dedication convinces the authorities, who leave after a warm acknowledgement of their efforts. When the harbour is out of sight, the runaway emerges with a grin worth all thanks. A new recruit for your expedition!","802680":"<b>Your crew's deceit is silly at best.</b> The lieutenants argue that they just arrived into port and couldn't possibly have had any contact with the population yet, but the warship obviously saw your vessel dock at the harbour. Their suspicions roused, they ask you to lower a footbridge for an inspection of the ship.","802681":"Hide the man and allow them onboard","802682":"Threaten to fire your cannons at their ship","802683":"<b>No better places to hide than the ones you know by heart.</b> Your sailors stash the fugitive into the belly of the ship, a bundle of rags buried between crates of supplies and sacks of food. A perfect camouflage. The patrolling guards soon abandon their inspection and let your ship leave after taking note of its name. To avoid future inspections, the runaway chooses to leave at the next island.","802684":"<b>The fugitive is more lost than the guards.</b> Your sailors shove him in the lower deck and urge him to hide without any form of guidance or advice. When the patrol guards descend into the ship, they find the runaway rummaging through the crates, still looking for a place to hide. They immediately seize him.","802685":"Enough complying already - threaten them to leave or else!","802686":"Enough errors already - let them take the man","802687":"<b>Your threat works despite the situation.</b> The sailors surround the guards in silence, stepping between them and the runaway, forcing the intruders to the upper deck and off the ship. Your vessel leaves before they can call reinforcements and the fugitive is dropped at the first harbour, for fear of retaliation. The separation is hurried and leaves a sour aftertaste. At least, with luck, he'll be safe.","802688":"<b>There's no threatening these men.</b> Your sailors try to step between them and the runaway, but the lump of scrawny arms and pouting faces is far from intimidating. They are shoved away and what few sailors try to resist are hauled along with the fugitive and taken to suffer his fate: death by hanging.","802689":"<b>Your crew offers little resistance.</b> They part before the patrol as it advances to seize the runaway. The dissident starts to thank the sailors for their efforts, but a slap shuts him up and he is collared before being dragged away. Your crew never managed to create the safe haven he deserved. They watch the warship disappear along the coast, trying to refrain from imagining the fate of their friend.","802690":"<b>Your firepower is impressive indeed.</b> The sailors line all hatches with cannons and light their fuses in the same movement, aiming the dark mouths at the patrolling warship. The patrol captain hurriedly orders his own crew to hurtle away from the crazy fools. The cannonade salutes their departure. The fugitive is extremely thankful and leave your crew at the next island with a warm goodbye.","802691":"<b>An empty threat.</b> Lying about your itinerary was more credible than pretending your ship can muster any form of naval power. Eyeing your sailors as they struggle to deploy and load the cannons, the patrol captain orders his men to get ready to board your ship. Your crew is suspicious enough for him.","802692":"They don't board you. You board them!","802693":"Let them board the ship and take the man","802694":"<b>The assault is abrupt and wicked.</b> For an agonizing moment of hesitation none seems to prevail, until your sailors manage to get the upper hand and slaughter the warship's crew. Your vessel flees the harbour and drops the fugitive at the next safe island, aware they have made enemies out of legal authorities for the sake of one good man.","802695":"<b>The fight is routine for your opponents.</b> Your crew boards the warship with nothing more than their confidence, and their sluggish skills crash against the overwhelming discipline of the patrol guards. The runaway stands up to help your sailors, screaming to get the guards' attention, and is instantly shot. His death marks the end of the fight. Your ship is exiled before the crew can mourn their dead.","802696":"<b>The patrol cowers away from your ship.</b> Of course they are not looking for a fight, not with a vessel looking as overpowered as yours! It might have been their swift deployment of cannons or the absolute stoicism with which your sailors warned the patrol - either way, your presence and menace is overwhelming. Your ship is free to leave the harbour, its new recruit already toasting to his freedom and the crew gladly following him.","802697":"<b>The patrol is not impressed by your ship's armament.</b> Your crew flings slurs at the inspection warship and scatters through the ship, deploying unsteady cannons, bumping against closed hatches and very audibly cursing their lack of ammunitions. Trying to refrain his laughter as his own crew deploys brand new ordnance rifles, the patrol captain asks your sailors to demonstrate how they intend to overpower him.","802698":"Demonstrate","802699":"Surrender","802700":"<b>It takes one accurate shot to demonstrate power.</b> Giving up on shooting all cannons, your sailors focus on firing the single best shot of their lives. The cannonball flies past the warship's railings and crushes their mainmast, sending wood and metal to rain on the patrol guards and giving your ship the window of time necessary to flee. The fugitive leaves your crew at the next island, grateful but unwilling to aggravate your feud with the local authorities.","802701":"<b>Poor decision.</b> Following their display of clumsy preparation, your sailors try to attack using the artillery they were insulting a second before. The cannons rear under their mishandling and fire at the ship itself, piercing hole after hole in the hull and hurling sailors into the sea. The patrol faces no resistance when they come onboard, pluck the fugitive, and leave the devastated vessel.","802702":"<b>Your crew offers little resistance.</b> They part before the patrol as it advances to seize the runaway. The dissident starts to thank the sailors for their efforts, but a slap shuts him up and he is collared before being dragged away. Your crew never managed to create the safe haven he deserved. They watch the warship disappear along the coast, trying to refrain from imagining the fate of their friend.","802703":"The fugitive holds his breath as you prepare the bribe.","802704":"Confirm","802705":"Cancel","802706":"<b>A smooth operation.</b> The patrol pockets your goods with twisted smiles, your payment surpassing the rewards promised for the capture of the runaway. As they clear the way and your ship passes by them, your new recruit waves to the guards and curtsies before wishing them a great day. Yes, your crew is going to like him.","802707":"<b>Your offer is far from enough.</b> The patrolling guards must have been promised a great reward for the capture of the fugitive. Taking your attempt as an effort to bribe them and highly suspicious behaviour, they lower footbridges and open cannon hatches, ready to board your ship.","802708":"<b>Your sailors hand over the runaway.</b> The refugee is dejected but keeps his emotions in check, letting the patrolling guards chain him while looking straight at your crew. His look is avoided. The patrol rewards the sailors with bags of supplies, a miserable trade for the life of a good man and the shame of your crew.","802710":"Bottles Found in the Sea","802711":"<b>Castaways request your help, but where could they be?</b> Shark-baiting is a common distraction for your sailors. Their latest catch provided much more entertainment than expected: in its belly was a bottle and in the bottle were three sheets of paper, each a copy of the same message in different languages. Piecing together the documents to make up for their weathered content, the crew can make out a call for help and a latitude, but nothing more.","802712":"Examine the entrails of the shark for clues","802713":"Map the islands matching the partial coordinates","802714":"There's no time to spare for such things","802715":"<b>The stomach of the shark reveals where it's been.</b> Glittering corals, exotic scales, characteristic fish bones. Your doctors finish their inspection of the shark's entrails and confirm the destination: to the Southern coral barriers! When the ship reaches the correct latitude, several islands litter the horizon. The crew hesitates to come closer. The water is shallower than usual and filled with sharp coral reefs.","802718":"Navigate closer to the islands and their reefs","802719":"Stay away and have the look-out search for castaways","802720":"<b>Your ship avoids the deadly reefs and finds the castaways!</b> The vessel groans as it swims through the limpid waters, the deepest corals reflecting its shadow as it avoids them. It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach and sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.","802721":"<b>The ship cannot pass the underwater barrier.</b> Despite your navigator's efforts, the ship bumps against the coral reef - the manoeuvre is too complex and too risky for her. The crew is forced to turn its back to the paradisiacal islands. Whether the castaways were real, whether they were indeed stranded here, they will never know.","802722":"<b>Found them!</b> Your look-out shows their brilliance when they spot the thin smoke line of a campfire in the distance. A dinghy is sent to retrieve the castaways and comes back filled to the brim with men in overgrown beards, torn clothes, and awed faces. Their captain pledges himself to your crew and, once shaved and washed, the castaways prove themselves to be excellent sailors and even better companions.","802723":"<b>The look-out draws a blank.</b> Scanning the islands from afar is a difficult exercise, made even harder by the lack of experience. The crew soon realizes that it will never find anyone from such a distance. Reluctant to risk the ship's integrity over the mere possibility of the castaways' existence, your sailors choose to leave and forget.","802724":"<b>The homemade autopsy is a mess.</b> The shark's entrails are cut along with their contents and spilled over the deck is a nauseous mass of gore and artefacts of unknown origin. The doctor cannot make sense of the anarchy he created.","802725":"Interpret the patterns in the shark's entrails","802726":"Divination? Let's just stop now","802727":"<b>Relentless faith guides the most deserving.</b> In the spilled gut of the shark, your navigators see the shapes of islands, your doctors see the patterns of life forms, your boatswain sees the promise of rewards. Driven by an inner force beyond simple greed, the crew sails past coral reefs and insidious currents and finds the island on which the castaways had been waiting for rescue. Their relief is glorious and their captain promises to serve your crew!","802728":"<b>There is nothing to find but deceit.</b> Your cooper burns sage among the remains of the shark and sniffs the lumpy smoke. If forces do talk to him, they might have been beyond what he could handle: he suddenly pounces on the closest sailor, crushing her throat between his hands. Three more fall before his frenzy drives him overboard with an otherworldly scream. The castaways are cursed and the sailors mourn their comrades for the rest of the trip.","802729":"<b>Shark, bottle and messages are thrown overboard.</b> Several sailors protest against the rash decision and would have preferred to exhaust all options before giving up, or at least keep the messages to share them at the next harbour. The imagined blame and grief of the castaways haunt them for a while.","802730":"<b>The search defines a searchable area.</b> Many islands match the latitude but much less could be mapped on an actual shipping route. By deducing where the castaways' ship might have gone, your navigators identify a handful of islands which could host the castaway. After two weeks of smooth sailing, your ship reaches the area: a necklace of islands linked by strands of deadly coral reef.","802731":"<b>Your navigator is overwhelmed by the mass of possibilities.</b> Unable to find a proper searching method and define a list of reasonable proportions, they abandon their task and admit the crew might as well try to work out the contents of the entrails. It is said as a joke, however, some sailors consider the idea.","802732":"<b>The bottle and its messages are thrown back into the sea.</b> The crew's regrets drift away with the bottle and the castaways are soon forgotten.","802734":"The Preacher","802735":"<b>Your chaplain is going overboard with his preaching.</b> Blaming the expedition's mishaps and hazards on the supposed heresy of the ship's officers, the man of faith manages to rouse the gradual distrust and anger of the sailors. His preaching is now part of the crew's daily routine. His words find echo in the mouths of the sailors, and your lieutenants can see their authority slipping away.","802736":"Demonstrate that his doubts are fuelled by a mental illness","802737":"Discredit him in a direct confrontation","802738":"Simply punish him without taking measures against his ideas","802739":"<b>The man of faith belongs to an asylum.</b> Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon and accuses him of megalomania, listing the traits of the madness: desire for attention, desire for control, desire to rouse the paranoia of others in order to match one's own. The portrait is a perfect depiction of the chaplain, and, despite their former affection for the man, the sailors agree that he should be sedated with laudanum for the rest of the trip.","802740":"<b>The doctor only proves his own paranoia.</b> Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon with a loud declaration, stating that the man of faith is, in fact, a soul tormented by a mental illness. With all eyes on him, your doctor utters a list of personal opinions rather than medical facts, and the chaplain welcomes his doubts with benevolence. His influence flourishes and your lieutenants have to make do with him for the rest of the trip.","802741":"<b>Your diplomat has a greater way with words.</b> She silently enters the lower deck during the chaplain's daily preaching and waits in a corner of a room. When the man of faith finally loses his nerve and asks her what she wants, she lists two hours worth of the chaplain's arguments and, without pause, offers counterpoints for each of them. The humiliation is magnificent and the chaplain's babbling defence convinces the crew of his puerility. They lose interest.","802742":"<b>Your diplomat was not ready to face the chaplain.</b> She confronts the preacher before the crew and flaunts her interpretation of the chaplain's mistakes, stating how wrong he is without taking into account the weeks of argument he had built with his followers. Her diatribe convinces none but herself, and the chaplain simply remarks that her anger is proof of his being right. Your lieutenants have to make do with his whims for the rest of the trip.","802743":"<b>Not the most diplomatic solution, but it works.</b> Trusted sailors interrupt the chaplain during his daily preaching and drag him to the upper deck, where your first mate welcomes the man of faith with a devoted flogging. The display of violence mostly proves the preacher's point, but the menace of the officers' ire is greater than the crew's distrust in them. The trip resumes in a climate of tension.","802745":"Jolly Roger","802746":"<b>It's a pirate ship!</b>The crew thought them extinct, but reality proves them wrong: a torn black flag bearing skull and bones flaps against the weather-worn mast of the approaching ship. The spectral silhouettes of starved men pile up against its rail guards, eager to feed on their prey.","802747":"Release an anchor to pivot and face the attacking ship","802748":"Let them come, rouse the spirit of the crew with a speech","802749":"<b>These scoundrels will see what true sailors look like!</b> In a demonstration of their tactical flair, your crew works to release the starboard anchor. The weighed cross dives into the sea, finds a sturdy ledge, and commands the ship's movement. Your vessel jumps and drifts to the side - face to face with the pirates.","802750":"<b>The manoeuvre is a mess.</b> There is a wide difference between the intent and the result. What tactical advantage your crew thought they could gain over the pirates is lost as soon as the anchor enters the water, slowing the ship down and turning it into a perfect target for its attackers.","802751":"Fire the cannons!","802752":"Bombard them with handmade grenades!","802753":"<b>Flawless victory.</b> The volley of cannonballs demolishes the pirate ship's flanks, each projectile aimed at the most mould-ridden parts of the wood. The antique vessel collapses on itself and your sailors have but to watch the pirates drown then loot the flotsam at will.","802754":"<b>Was this aimed at the pirates or the actual sky?</b> Your cannonballs fly way over the pirate ship and allow the scoundrels to react to your sudden manoeuvre. The tide of the battle shifts in their favour again as grappling hooks catch your ship and lock it into place.","802755":"Defend against the boarding pirates","802756":"Surrender to them","802757":"<b>Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.</b> The attackers barely set foot on deck that your sailors launch their assault, a coordinated charge grinded into perfection by years of practice. Still, the pirates resist to the best of their ability, and their desperate foray costs the lives of a few good men.","802758":"<b>Panic.</b> Your sailors lose their nerve and cannot handle the very thought of being boarded - they abandon their posts and weapons and beg for a mercy that is not given. The pirates, at least as frantic as their victims, slaughter several crew members before noticing their surrender. They plunder your supplies and scurry away.","802759":"<b>A refusal to fight.</b> Bound by their code of honour, the pirates spurn the idea of killing any of the surrendering sailors and help themselves to your supplies. The shabby scoundrels celebrate their meagre plunder with glee and leave your crew riddled with pity for their attackers.","802760":"<b>The pirates didn't expect such a crafty attack.</b> Instead of using the cannons, your sailors prepare explosives akin to those used in trench wars: a bottle filled with powder, hemp for the fuse, nails for the visual. The grenades spit their fire into the enemies' ship and terrify the pirates, who have never seen such techniques before. The tattered attackers summon your crew's pity, who lets them leave in exchange of a symbolic fee.","802761":"<b>Shouldn't your sailors focus on what they actually know?</b> The crew improvises grenades based on hearsay of military tales, pouring powder and rusty metal into bags of moist hemp - unstable bombs which explode as soon as their fuse is lit. The sailors don't even have the time to count their victims: the pirates use the mayhem as a diversion, and they board your ship!","802762":"Insist on fighting and steer the ship to face them","802763":"That's enough risk-taking: surrender","802764":"<b>Nice rectification.</b> Fighting against the pulling anchor and the pushing current, your helmsman manages to stir the ship to the side and makes it face the pirates' vessel. This sequence of surprising movements gives your crew a small window of action before the pirates can react.","802765":"<b>Too hasty.</b> Your helmsman is used to conventional manoeuvres only, and steering the ship while its anchor is still grazing the sea floor is beyond his nautical comprehension. The entire ship shakes and swirls, drifting over the waves in a violent jump which sends it crashing into the pirate ship. The scoundrels board you!","802766":"Fire all cannons!","802767":"Prepare to board!","802768":"<b>Send the pirates down to the depths!</b> First their mainmast, then their sails, then the deck itself: the pirate ship is bombarded in a relentless yet precise manner. Soon the pirates' corpses litter the sea, and your crew is free to fish their well-deserved rewards from the carcass of the pirate ship.","802769":"<b>Your crew is not up to the challenge.</b> The first volley of cannonballs glides over the pirate ship and, quite remarkably, manages to miss the ship, its sails, and its masts. The attackers retaliate with their own cannons and the sea becomes a stage for your explosive exchanges. When the smoke clears, both ships are ruined and the pirates scamper away. Your crew celebrates their victory while trying to ignore the extensive damage.","802770":"<b>A present for Davy Jones, and booty for your crew.</b> Your sailors are fighters by nature, and the ramshackle pirate crew is no match for them. What few scoundrels oppose the assault are sent to greet the fishes and the others are forced to surrender - your crew plunders their ship but find little loot on the decrepit vessel. It is pity more than mercy that makes them spare the pirates.","802771":"<b>There's no denying your crew's lack of strength.</b> The sailors throw themselves at the pirates with a noticeable will to fight but hardly enough skill to fulfil their dreams of domination. The scrawny pirates beat the crew and leave, slightly less bruised and weary than their victims but too drained and wounded to linger on your ship.","802772":"Fight till the decimation of either crew","802773":"Listen to reason and surrender","802774":"<b>An underwhelming victory.</b> Yes, your crew manages to gain the upper hand over the pirates and displays decent self-control and fighting skill, but the pirates are far from their image of wondrous sea fighters. They are weak. The skeletal attackers scatter as your sailors crush them, and your broken deck is littered with scrawny corpses. The repairs take a lesser toll on morale than the gnawing pity your crew feels for the scoundrels.","802775":"<b>Your sailors' desperation is no match for the pirates'.</b> The attackers pour from the carcass of their ship, oblivious to the large faults in the wood, flowing like blood from a wound. They wash over your sailors, who scatter in their current, unable to oppose resistance and too weak to even consider it. When the wave of pirates recedes, your deck is covered in fragments of both ship and men.","802776":"<b>This should have been done much earlier.</b> Your weapons are dropped just in time for the pirates to stop their assault. They spare the crew in exchange for a decent quantity of loot - however, their mercy will never give back the men lost to your hazardous manoeuvres and their outstanding failure.","802777":"<b>A refusal to fight.</b> Bound by their code of honour, the pirates spurn the idea of killing any of the surrendering sailors and help themselves to your supplies. The shabby scoundrels celebrate their meagre plunder with glee and leave your crew riddled with pity for their attackers.","802778":"<b>There is faith in the upcoming victory.</b> Your acting lieutenant climbs the rail guard and points his gun at the skies, defying the heavens themselves. I am weak, vulnerable, he says, like well-born men are - but while my body is feeble my heart is that of a captain, and your captain no less. And like you sailors I will fight, and I will fight to the death, and I will continue to fight after this death, for not a single pirate will lay a single finger on our ship, in this life or in the next!","802779":"<b>There's no spirit nor courage to be roused.</b> Your crew barely reacts to your lieutenant's speech, hypnotized by the approaching pirate ship, entranced by their terror. The attackers board the ship and everything is both too fast and too slow: the massacre of the resisting sailors, the looting, the pirates' departure. When the crew regains its senses, they realize the price of their cowardice.","802780":"Board the pirates' ship!","802781":"Fire all cannons!","802782":"<b>A fantastic charge.</b> Led by the acting lieutenant, your sailors hurtle down the boarding bridges and storm the pirate ship, leaving a trail of mangled scoundrels in their wake. The black flag is torn from its mast and the pirate booty is plundered. Taken by a sudden generosity, your crew lets the survivors scurry away with their wreck of a vessel. They might be the last pirates alive.","802783":"<b>Your sailors' strength is mental only.</b> They lack both the skill and speed required for a quick take-down of the boarded ship, and allow the pirates to regroup behind makeshift barricades of crates and sacks of goods.","802784":"Take cover and shoot from a distance","802785":"Continue your charge!","802786":"<b>The pirate ship is a playground for your crew.</b> They avoid the shots of the scoundrels with ease and take cover, burying behind overthrown barrels of rum and taking down the pirates, accurate shot by accurate shot. When not a single enemy is left standing, your ship recovers its crew and leaves - victorious, but drenched in the smell of alcohol and gunpowder.","802787":"<b>Your crew is ill-prepared for this challenge.</b> The sailors run around in circles, unable to settle on a good cover while the pirates shoot at will, taking them down with ease. The remaining members of your crew are spared in exchange of their cargo, and your expedition takes a toll from this loss.","802788":"<b>A manifestation of their true skill.</b> Despite its initial fumbling, your crew manages to reach the pirates' covers and forces its way through the barricades, overpowering the scoundrels in a matter of minutes. Not a single pirate is left standing, and as few sailors as possible suffered the same fate. It was the best they could do.","802789":"<b>Stubbornness will not trigger miracles.</b> Still proving how unskilled and weak they are, your sailors crash upon the pirates' barricade like foam upon the shore, and the gunshots scatter them across the deck. The pirates meet no resistance when they raid your ship, and the survivors shamelessly thank their attackers for taking nothing more than cargo.","802790":"<b>Flawless victory.</b> The volley of cannonballs demolishes the pirate ship's flanks, each projectile aimed at the most mould-ridden parts of the wood. The antique vessel collapses on itself and your sailors have but to watch the pirates drown then loot the flotsam at will.","802792":"<b>Was this aimed at the pirates or the actual sky?</b> Your cannonballs fly way over the pirate ship and allow the scoundrels to react to your bold, but uncontrolled manoeuvre. The tide of the battle shifts in their favour as grappling hooks catch your ship and lock it into place.","802793":"Defend against the boarding pirates","802794":"Surrender to them","802795":"<b>A refusal to fight.</b> Bound by their code of honour, the pirates spurn the idea of killing any of the surrendering sailors and help themselves to your supplies. The shabby scoundrels celebrate their meagre plunder with glee and leave your crew riddled with pity for their attackers.","802796":"<b>Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.</b> The attackers barely set foot on deck that your sailors launch their assault, a coordinated charge grinded into perfection by years of practice. Still, the pirates resist to the best of their ability, and their desperate foray costs the lives of a few good men.","802797":"<b>Disaster.</b> The courage of your sailors is not matched by their force, and the pirates wash through them like a wave through sand. When the attackers finally decide that culling your crew is not worth their time, the remaining sailors do not dare retaliate and simply stand their ground, keeping watch on their wrecked ship and devastated pride.","802799":"Taken In, Broken Out","802800":"<b>Behind bars!</b> The prolonged stay of your ship in this harbour is not a willed one. Obscure laws were breached and your whole crew was arrested under the pretence that borders, whose nature remains unknown, were not respected. Heavily armed foreigners lead your crew through the sinuous roads of their city and into the local jail, and after passing by a row of freshly hanged criminals, the sailors are locked up. Only two guards keep watch, their heads bobbing with fatigue. Are they underestimating your crew?","802801":"Poison the guards!","802802":"Dig an escape tunnel!","802803":"Prepare your defence for the incoming trial","802804":"<b>Two guards are not enough to resist your science.</b> The doctor brings out a sachet of vials and packets and produces leathery pouches filled with white powders, some matte, some glittering like sugar. He mixes a bit of this one and a bit of that one, gauging measures with the eye of the seasoned practitioner, then calls to the guards. When the unsuspecting wardens are close enough, the doctor blows the mixture in their face. The men drop dead!","802805":"<b>The doctor showcases his ignorance.</b> He produces a pouch of arsenic before calling the guards. When the jailers are close enough, the doctor is ready to blow the powder in their face - however, his lack of knowledge of the poison's properties backfires: the soft inhalation of the doctor is enough to bring the highly volatile poison to his lips, and he leaps back, coughing and wheezing. The guards immediately understand this was attempted murder.","802806":"Disguise as guards and escort the rest of the crew","802807":"Avoid drawing any attention and sneak outside","802808":"<b>The escape is flawless.</b> Two of your sailors don the guards' uniforms and drag the rest of the chained crew through the prison. When they are stopped at the exit, they mimic the local accent, briefly explain the liberation, and kick one of the chained sailors for good measure. The legitimate wardens buy the lie! It takes an even greater effort to refrain from laughing before reaching the ship and leaving the port.","802809":"<b>An attempt way beyond their ability.</b> Two sailors put on the guards' uniforms and lead the crew through the prison, until legitimate guards stop them and enquire about the strange cortege. The disguised men's fidgety attitude and suspiciously foreign accent is enough to convince the wardens to check their original cell: the bodies are found and with them comes the heavy charge of murder. The following day, the trial is held.","802812":"Offer to pay a fine, however high it might be","802813":"Pretend these actions were a demand from the higher-ups and have the crew repudiate Her Majesty","802815":"Confirm","802816":"Cancel","802817":"<b>The price is high, but fair.</b> Most of the expedition's budget is squandered in the brutal fine and if the crew is cleared of their charges, they find themselves forced to ration their supplies for the rest of the trip. The doctor and his accursed ideas are blamed and the man is turned into a scapegoat: his rations are regularly stolen, damaging his health and abilities, and, worse, the crew blatantly avoids his treatments.","802818":"<b>Who would accept such a meager payment?</b> Murder is not a subject to be triffled with and the foreign court makes its opinion clear: your crew will pay in the hardest way possible. To show that they value life more than your sailors, the judges impose a non-lethal punishment and insist on this point, devising a program of forced labour and precise observation to make sure the sailors suffer as much as possible without dying. Months of hell follow before the crew can leave.","802819":"<b>That lie is believable, but it doesn't erase your crew's crimes.</b> The foreign judges put aside any idea of death sentence and focus on finding a punishment befitting the crime: the crew is arranged into a procession and made to cross the city in chains, while chanting the ill-will of their Queen. Their patriotism tainted, the sailors never dare to pronounce her name again.","802820":"<b>Who would believe such an obvious lie?</b> Why would their Queen ask for such a menial task as poisoning oversea guards? To match the crime, the crew's lieutenants are forced to drink hemlock solutions and trapped in a single cell with the rest of the crew. The lieutenants gag and wheeze for days of agony, their skin puffing and their muscles stiffening in impossible positions until their breathing itself is locked into place. Only then are the sailors allowed to leave.","802821":"<b>The perfect crime!</b> Despite their numbers, your sailors manage to sneak through the prison and into the streets, where they become shadows under the moonless night. Led by your most competent hunters, they creep through back alleys and backyards until the obscurity delivers them below their ship. Feeling like the protagonists of an adventure novel and revelling in the sentiment, they leave the harbour in the gliding vessel - all lights off and no sound made.","802822":"<b>They are caught!</b> Your sailors' lack of discretion is awkward and it is only a matter of minutes before a patrol spots them. Without any prepared disguise or lie, they are instantly arrested and, worse, the bodies of the poisoned guards are found on the way back to their cell. The next morning, they are judged not for their meager trespassing, but for actual murder.","802823":"<b>A nice display of craftsmanship.</b> The crew digs a tunnel with skill, taking care of reinforcing the structure and analysing the soil's nature as they progress. They avoid the most friable sections of the city's ground and emerge on the coast, exactly as calculated. Your ship is not too far but a frigate guards it. Its lights are off, the guards might be sleeping and not actually keeping watch.","802825":"<b>A dead end.</b> The crew can handle basic digging, but their progress is reluctant, slowed by the constant fear of being buried in the makeshift tunnel. At the first obstacle they encounter, a large foundation pillar which blocks the way, all sailors hurriedly agree that there is nothing more to be done with the tunnel. They regain the cell, relieved.","802826":"<b>Buried alive.</b> The sailors have but a vague idea of how to dig an escape tunnel. They grind the earth with their bare hands, the pungent soil getting stuck under their nails and lining their clothes, hair, skin. As air comes to lack so does their judgement and the crew pushes forward, blind to the crumbling rock. The tunnel collapses on them and what few sailors were still outside are judged and released without any sentence - the death of their companions is punishment enough.","802827":"Stealthily sail away","802828":"Bombard the frigate as you leave","802829":"<b>Swift as a whisper.</b> Your sailors embark on the ship and deploy its sails in an excruciatingly slow manner, timing their flapping and clinking with the melody of the backwash. The vessel creaks softly and lets the sea take it, drifting away from the harbour with delicate movements of to and fro - soon the city is but a point on the horizon, and the sailors allow themselves to explode in a clamour of celebration.","802831":"<b>Ridiculously visible.</b> Your sailors tiptoe past the guarding frigate, their shadows stretching across the whole deck, their stressed whispers ringing through the night. As a testimony to their poor hunting skill, it takes a barrel in their cheeks for them to realize they have been spotted. The next morning, the judges' verdict takes into account the escape attempt and condemn half of your crew to a month of forced labour.","802832":"Offer to pay a fine instead","802833":"Force your crew into complying with the unreasonable demand","802835":"Confirm","802836":"Cancel","802837":"<b>Bribery is a reasonable option.</b> The payment offered satisfies the judges, who agree to let your sailors go. The crew mutters about the absurd trial and its even more absurd resolution, but their relief shows.","802838":"<b>Not enough.</b> The judges scoff at your attempt to bribe them with a so-called fine, and advise your crew to aim for a higher amount next time. To show they are not cheap, they extend their penalty to two months of forced labour and place the sailors under the tightest surveillance. The two months are a mixture of menial and unrewarding tasks and frequent and unwarranted whipping.","802839":"<b>The crew complies.</b> Following their superiors' orders, the sailors accept the judges' penalty and fulfil their obligations to the best of their abilities. One month of forced labour seems harsh even for the local population, who supports the crew's effort and vouch for their liberation: the crew earns an early release, tired but touched by the unexpected appreciation.","802840":"<b>The crew refuses to comply.</b> The insistence of your first mate cannot convince the sailors of sacrificing themselves for the good of the crew, and the heated debate that follows is cut short by the judges. If your crew cannot decide who to send into forced labour, all of them will go! Forced to submit, the crew invests its strength into one month of meaningless tasks and incessant bickering among themselves.","802841":"<b>An explosive escape!</b> The crew feels whole again aboard their ship, and they now have the tools to face their opponents. The loaded canons fire a volley of precise blasts on the foreign frigate and its docking harbour, setting the whole coast aflame. Your ship sails away with the blaze in its back, a vision of grandiose might which fills the sailors with pride.","802842":"<b>A failed attempt.</b> The sailors lack the habits required to load the canons under the cover of the night. Misguided movements and poor knowledge of the armament makes the canons overflow with powder. When they are fired, the weapons explode and take their gunner with them, offering a loud indication of the escapees' position. The crew is seized and sent back to their cell. At dawn, the judges sentence half the crew to a month of forced labour.","802844":"<b>An epic trial!</b> At the first chance to speak, your crew engages in an extensive and thrilling retelling of its adventures, captivating the audience and the judges. They climb and rock benches to mimic past naval battles, embark the public by asking them timely and suspenseful questions, modify their tales according to the audience's whims. Their trespassing is made part of the story and as they retell the trial itself, the judges insist on letting them go. They leave as heroes!","802849":"<b>Your defence doesn't move the judges.</b> The trial follows obscure local laws and their meandering unravelling goes beyond what your diplomat is used to. Her words stumble upon the judges' traps, and her lack of understanding of the legal subtleties of the situation is obvious to anyone. To the dismay of your crew, the judges' verdict is harsh: one month of public labour for at least half of your sailors.","802851":"<b>Your diplomat is beyond awkward.</b> At the trial, she interrupts the judges to insist on meaningless details and points out not your crew's innocence, but the reasons why their guilt is, to quote her, not that bad. Her lack of professionalism and conviction is irritating and the judges interrupt the hearing with a hasty judgement just to stop her. Your crew is coerced into one full month of forced labour, a disproportionate and disheartening sentence.","802852":"The Hunter and the Prey","802853":"South America at last! After weeks of crossing the ocean your crew takes a well deserved break in the first New World harbour crossing their path. But as the night is falling and the crew is preparing to dock in a bay, the look out screams: \"A steam ship is behind us, closing in!!\" The captains looks and whispers \"The same type of ship Mister Goode's murderer was on. The Pyrophorians found us.\" The night is dark, the Pyrophorian might not have seen exactly where your ship is.","802854":"Battle the Pyrophorians, fire the canons","802855":"All the canons are targeting on the same Pyrophorian ship, hoping it will sink or flee, leaving the way open. The crew is well trained, they aim precisely but the balls merely cling on the Pyrophorian's ship hull. A beast of a ship.  However, for lookout trained eye, a change is clear: the ship is moving much slower, an engine must have been hit! As the crew were rejoycing, they are suddenly stopped and grasp in terror: a weapon like never before is being loaded on the front of the Pyrophorian ship, an abominable flame thrower. If they don't act fast the crew will be in range!","802856":"Target the same spot to immobilize the ship","802857":"A great feat of precision and weapon mastery. A great noise can be heard from the Pyrophorian ship, the ship moves for a few more meters and then stops. The crew uses this opportunity to sail away at once, leaving the threatening monster behind, hoping it will never be seen again.","802858":"The crew is not well versed enough in cannon mastery to all aim at the same spot. Most balls just fall into the sea or roll on the Pyrophorian ship deck. The mouth of the Pyrophorian's dragon is now right in front of the crew ship, unleashing the fires of hell on the poor men at the balustrade. Numerous men can be seen on board of the Pyrophorian ship, too many to even hope take them down by combat. The Pyrophorian are rearming the flamethrower.","802859":"Disable the flamethrower","802860":"Manage to disable it expertly, explode right when the crew ship was at enough distance, create a lot of smoke and ashes. It is chaos on board of the Pyrophorian ship. This gives the crew just enough time to sail away without the Pyrophorian being able to block them.","802861":"The crew fires the cannons unorderly, not waiting for their own ship to be at a safer distance to do so. The flamethrower explodes, killing Pyro and creating chaos on board but also damaging badly the crew ship and injuring several sailors. The crew takes advantage of the chaos to leave before the Pyro can follow them.","802862":"Throw precisely grenades on the Pyrophorian deck","802863":"Throw the grenade perfectly, landing every time at the foot of Pyrophorian, killing them on the spot. The chaos created on board leaves enough time for the crew to leave.","802864":"Grenades should only be handle by people who know how to throw. While some managed to hit the Pyrophorian, creating chaos on their deck, some also never left the crew ship, killing the unskilled sailor on the spot and injuring several around them. Take advantage of the chaos to leave.","802865":"The crew fires the canons in an unordered manner. Many balls just end up diving into the water. The crew has made fool of themselves and made no damage to the Pyrophorian while indicating really clearly their position. The Pyrophorian ship is moving fast toward the crew, the sailors grasp in terror: a weapon like never before is being loaded on the front of the Pyrophorian ship, an abominable flame thrower. The dragon first breath is devastating, several men are injured and the hull damaged.","802866":"Disable the flamethrower","802867":"Manage to disable it, explode, create a lot of smoke and ashes. It is chaos on board of the Pyrophorian ship. This gives the crew just enough time to sail away without the Pyrophorian being able to block them.","802868":"Don't manage to touch the flamethrower, not precise enough, the balls are flying in the air and land in the sea. The Pyrophorian fire again, burning one man to death. They are now so close the warm of the flamethrower is palpable.","802869":"Order part of the crew to jump on board and explode the flamethrower with dynamite","802870":"It is bold, risky even. The elite soldiers jump on board of the Pyrophorian ship, light dynamite stick and throw them on the flamethrower. The device explodes chaotically, killing several Pyrophorian and injuring the bold sailors. They take advantage of the dense smoke created by the explosion to jump back on the ship as it is leaving the bay, leaving the Pyrophorian to their confusion. ","802871":"A risky move only the best soldiers could manage, alas the crew has none of them. The soldiers jump on board, fire the dynamite but do not manage to throw them before the Pyrophorian tackle. The explosion which ensue kills all the soldiers on the spot, along with a few Pyrophorian. The confusion allows the rest of the crew to escape but at the cost of their comrades' lives.","802872":"Aim at the engine to prevent the ship from moving","802873":"Works, the ship moves for a few more meters and stops. While the Pyrophorian manage to burn the stern of the ship while it sails away, the crew still managed to make it out alive without being followed. ","802874":"It takes time to the inexperience crew to manage to touch the engine despite having all the cannons focused on it. This gives the Pyrophorian the opportunity to launch a new fire attack which is very deadly for a big portion of the crew before their engine is finally disabled and the mourning crew can sail away.","802875":"Outrun them, leave the bay while they rearm","802876":"Speed itself. Taking advantage of the favourable wind, the crew manages to push the ship to its full capacity. She passes the Pyrophorian ships right before they launch a new fire attack. It was a close call, while the ship is fast the crew feels for days the creeping presence of the Pyrophorian behind them until a few days later the horizon becomes suspiciously clear.","802877":"Handling the wind is not an easy feat for beginners. The ship does not cut through the waves fast enough, the Pyrophorian is still too close for the crew to be out of danger. Close enough even for men to be able to jump from the stern on board of the Pyro ship. The firethrower is being rearmed.","802878":"Take advantage of the night, skirt the bay and sneak outside","802879":"The crew shuts down all the lights, the ship slides on the waves silently, skirting the bay and finding a less protected spot in the blockade. While the dark helps the crew being invisible, it also makes the bay deepness more difficult to estimate. A loud sound resonates as the ship hull is touching the bottom. The ship cannot continue forward without being stuck, taking the time to manoeuvre is necessary to go into safer waters. However the noise has alerted the Pyrophorian ship, it is moving toward the crew, maybe it is better to deal with them first.","802880":"Attack the Pyrophorian ship engine to stop his move","802881":"Still in pitch darkness, the captain takes advantage of the element of surprise. Discretely, he orders the crew to prepare the canons and waits for the perfect moment the ship is close enough. When it is, he screams fire. All the canons, perfectly aimed, are targeting the ship. In a few perfect blows the engine is touched, the stream ship stops moving. The crew is able to leave.","802882":"The crew doesn't know how to manoeuvre the canons discretely. Loading them, gathering the powder, giving order to aim is all made loudly, and rather not very efficiently. By the time the Pyrophorian are in range the sailors are not ready but the Pyrophorian are. Now fully capable of seeing the once hidden crew, they position themselves close to the ship. The crew realizes they are possessing an abominable weapon positioned at the ship front: a monstruous flamethrower. it first blow feels like the fire of Hell have been freed, several men are injured, their fleshes licked by the flames.","802883":"Manoeuvre and leave the bay before they can get too close","802884":"Manage to use the steering wheel with an extreme precision, move slightly backward and turn in one go. The exit of the bay is close, the manoeuvre was done so fast and efficiently the ship manages to leave the bay before the Pyrophorian catch up. ","802885":"The manoeuvre takes time, it would have required master skill to pull it through before the Pyrophorian get too close. Now fully capable of seeing the once hidden crew, they position themselves close to the ship. The crew realizes they are possessing an abominable weapon positioned at the ship front: a monstruous flamethrower. it first blow feels like the fire of Hell have been freed, several men are injured, their fleshes licked by the flames.","802886":"Disable the flamethrower","802887":"Manage to disable it, explode, create a lot of smoke and ashes. It is chaos on board of the Pyrophorian ship. This gives the crew just enough time to sail away without the Pyrophorian being able to block them.","802888":"Don't disable it, take high damages from the front. Don't let the Pyrophorian rearming a 3rd time, the captain orders the crew the fill the sails and leave at once before the Pyrophorian crew has the time to reforme into moving position.","802889":"Trick the Pyrophorian into following you into the shallow waters","802890":"No more need to hide, the captain orders to put on all lights on the ship. The water deepness is now clearly visible. Seeing the hull depth of the Pyrophorian ship is bigger then his, the captain starts a risky manoeuvre into shallow water just deep enough for the crew ship but too shallow for the steam ship. Navigating perfectly into the shallow water, the captain manages to have the ship leave the area while the Pyrophorian ship gets stuck. The way out is open.","802891":"While the Pyrophorian do get stuck following the ship into the shallow water, the crew ship also gets damaged. The captain fails the estimate properly the depth of the water and the hull touches the ground. The ship manages to leave the bay but the reparation will take much time and energy.","802892":"Navigating discretely is not an easy fit and the crew does not manage to operate a full ship with the lights off and without shooting orders. A few sailors get too loud, the ship is spotted. They are now indicating their position. The Pyrophorian ship is moving fast toward the crew, the sailors grasp in terror: a weapon like never before is being loaded on the front of the Pyrophorian ship, an abominable flame thrower. The dragon first breath is devastating, several men are injured and the hull damaged.","802893":"Rely on the sails and the captain mastery, leave the bay at once","802894":"The ship goes with the wind. Taking all sails out, manoeuvring the steering wheel perfectly to take the wind from behind, the ship leaves at once, leaving the two remaining Pyrophorian ships far behind. The crew is relieved as they become just dots in the horizon. Surely they won't follow us now.","802895":"The Pyrophorian dragon is faster than the captain poor skills allow the ship to be. The mouth of the Pyrophorian's dragon is now right behind the crew ship, it unleashes the fires of hell on the poor men at the balustrade. Numerous men can be seen on board of the Pyrophorian ship, too many to even hope take them down by combat. The Pyrophorian are rearming the flamethrower.","999001":"Backspace","999002":"Tab","999003":"Return","999004":"Shift","999005":"Ctrl","999006":"Alt","999007":"Pause","999008":"CapsLock","999009":"Escape","999010":"Space","999011":"PageUp","999012":"PageDown","999013":"End","999014":"Home","999015":"Left","999016":"Up","999017":"Right","999018":"Down","999019":"PrintScreen","999020":"Insert","999021":"Delete","999022":"0","999023":"1","999024":"2","999025":"3","999026":"4","999027":"5","999028":"6","999029":"7","999030":"8","999031":"9","999032":"A","999033":"B","999034":"C","999035":"D","999036":"E","999037":"F","999038":"G","999039":"H","999040":"I","999041":"J","999042":"K","999043":"L","999044":"M","999045":"N","999046":"O","999047":"P","999048":"Q","999049":"R","999050":"S","999051":"T","999052":"U","999053":"V","999054":"W","999055":"X","999056":"Y","999057":"Z","999058":"Left
