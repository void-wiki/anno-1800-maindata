To succeed in an expedition, you should prepare correctly: <br/>- Rations are crucial aboard of your ship. They give moral to your crew and allow you to feed them between each obstacle their encounter. A starving crew loses more moral between each obstacle than a crew you feed. Moreover, you crew appreciates having different types of food. Feeding them with diverse rations will allow them to keep a higher moral than if you fed them with the same type of good over and over.<br/>- The threats indicates which kind of obstacles you are most likely to encounter. Each type of obstacle can be dealt with a specific attribute (ex: Naval Power is very helpful in the case of a Naval Battle threat). When preparing for a specific threat your captain warned you against, you are increasing the moral of your crew greatly.<br/>- To prepare for a threat, you must store in your ship a good or an item which possesses the related attribute. Ex: If the captain warns you about a wildlife threat, you should prepare to hunt. Hunting attribute can be found in goods such as fur coats or in specialist such as the Forester. In order to get the full number of the attribute indicated in the good, you need to store in the ship 50 units of that good.<br/>- Once facing an obstacle, you will have to take decision. Most of the times, decisions are linked to attributes. The better you are in the related attribute, the most chance you have to get the best outcome of this decision.<br/>- Expeditions have 3 different difficulties levels: Easy, Average and Hard, represented by skulls. An easy expedition will have less obstacles before you reach the reward, however the reward will be less rare than harder expedition. Moreover, it is easier to fill the moral bar of easy expedition. The hardest the expedition, the better items and goods you must store onboard in order to fill the moral bar.

Were you to provide us with some... arguments to defend our cause, I'd be sure to repay you.","16620":"The continued trade of our nation depends on our ships, as you well know, but we've had a few more incidents than expected as of late. I would be in your debt if you could supply the materials needed to rebuild our fleet.","16621":"Steam vessels lack the elegance of sails, but this game cannot be won unless you adapt fast to the new rules. Bring us what we need to upgrade our fleet and La Fortune's people will remember.","16622":"As used as I am to being stabbed in the back by now, it never gets any easier. These... associates of mine ran off with our supply of food. I hate to ask, but my hands are tied here — I will take any bread you can spare.","16623":"I have a very important shipment incoming, but the Empire must not know we are the recipients or they will intercept it.

Come visit some time, see for yourself what true freedom looks like.","16628":"That weasel Bleakworth has one of my crewmembers locked up on the other side of the world. He has no use for them other than to torment me. I'm not getting anywhere close that imperialist scum's claws, but I'm sure you will find a way to break them free.","16629":"Right when I thought you couldn't stoop any lower you come here doing chores for a pirate. But you are right, this worm lets off nothing about Jean. You can have them... Provided you bring these fugitives back to their cells.","16630":"Good. These criminals will be punished accordingly... Now take this filth away from my sight. Let Jean enjoy his time with them while he still can...","16631":"A man appeared at our shores seeking refuge from a slave owner. He's well protected, but they will not see you coming. Bring him to me, we'll show him what we do to those who like to bargain with human lives...","16633":"I still get bad dreams of the days when I was a slave... Did you know I was sold to another landowner when I was a child? Never saw mama or papa again. Uncle Etienne escaped. Apparently, he now lives a peaceful life in El Puerto. He may know what happened to the rest of them...","16634":"Jean? Of course I remember the little rascal! I earnt my freedom years ago. His mama passed away, but his papa was still under the same master when I left. They keep the records well guarded, but they'll lead you to him if you can get them.","16635":"These records... They're outdated, but there's a name: William Ward. It is a long shot, but my father might still be with him. I heard rumours of a slave ship travelling near El Puerto. If you can take a picture, I can see if it is our man or not.","16636":"It is him - William Ward! It is now or never - we must strike before they take my father away again! Join me, my friend!","16639":"There is word of a slave owner nearby. Jean has asked you to sneak past his security and bring the man to him.","16640":"La Fortune's people don't bite, right?

Because she gave hers away to those who are less privileged, of course.","16698":"Bente has no choice but to set her love of animals aside if she wants her crew to survive an expedition to the poles. Canned food would make for the perfect rations.","16699":"Bente has discovered that caoutchouc is the perfect cruelty-free replacement for leather, and would like you to deliver some to her.","16700":"Whalers have docked at Bente's harbour - a grave mistake, for she will protect cetacean life at any cost. She would never think of harming the crew, of course... But when they're all ashore...","16702":"One of Bente's expeditions didn't make it back to port safely. The crew are OK, but the precious hummingbirds they were carrying are still lost amongst the wreckage.","16703":"A visitor's ship has been in a terrible accident, and the passengers need to be saved! Bente has asked for your help.","16704":"Bente was awaiting the arrival of some precious relics from one of her expeditions, but it seems the sailors believed they were cursed, so they've thrown them overboard. She's asked you to recover the artefacts for her.","16705":"Bente wants to increase environmental awareness. She's positive that seeing you both cleaning the oceans together will, one day, make people understand.","16707":"Bente is confident that nothing bad will happen to her on her expeditions, but her advisors still worry it might be dangerous to go alone. She'd like you to escort her until her advisors start to relax.","16708":"Bente's cousin Alva paid her a visit, but decided to leave earlier than planned after meeting the household pets. Bente has asked if you would escort her cousin home.","16709":"The Pyrphorian arsonist taunts you as you arrest him.","16710":"The Pyrphorians persist with their schemes.

Of course, if you're feeling even slightly regretful about your collaboration, there is always another way...","16803":"I have no idea how that woman, Sarmento, has become the greatest adversary of La Corona. It truly is baffling.

Bring me proof of their whereabouts, and I'll make sure they get their severance.","17120":"Must be nice pirating in warmer waters, away from the Empire's grim tentacles. Me and my boys could take La Fortune any day of the week. Show me their island, and I'll laugh meself to tears!","17121":"Anne Harlow is certain her pirates are rougher than Jean La Fortune's. She wants you to bring her a picture of their island, so she can see for herself.","17122":"Being a big name isn't exactly good for business when you're a smuggler. Keeps me on my toes. That's why I've come up with a creative solution: you do it.","17123":"Anne Harlow is a well-known name in the piracy business, but it's never a good idea to be a famous smuggler. Her brilliant solution is to make you do it instead.","17124":"That old dog, Mary! Only she could pull a trick like this, pretending to be with child to escape the gallows! We'll break her out of prison before they notice it's just a beer belly. Better yet: you will.","17125":"Anne's old friend Mary managed to fool Bleakworth's officers, and escape the death penalty. Anne's sent you to break her out of prison, before they notice her stomach's not getting any rounder.","17126":"I know, I just *know* there must be a record of what happened to my father buried under the Queen's pet's nose. Go, find them, and let nobody see you. Bring them back to me.","17127":"Yes! Looks like these people just had their tongues too busy with the bloody king's boots to speak up against my father's murder. Well, now... Top of the list, Sir Ulbrecht Brawl... Now Annie's got some names, let's go pay him a visit, shall we?","17128":"Next on the list is Christine Marble. She thinks she's safe on the other side of the world, but she's got another thing coming if she thinks an ocean's going to stop a Harlow's rage...","17129":"There's a spring in my step now I don't share the world with these unscrupulous fazarts. But still one remains... Blake, too, watched as his king sentenced my father to the gallows on a whim. He too must pay. Take these flags as yours - he'll never know what hit him.","17130":"Oh dear! Anne has attacked us before, but never like this! As sorry as I am for her loss, she cannot continue to terrorise the good, innocent people of High Clarence Hall. I'm afraid the Queen will be forced to intervene.","17131":"So, this is it. Finally, we get the daughter's attention. She will die for her father's life, as I lived for my father's death. You... you do understand, don't you? Fight by my side... friend.","17132":"Benjamin Harlow was executed by the former king. Anne wants you to find every relevant record you can find at High Clarence Hall, and bring it back to her, unseen.","17133":"Anne now has the names of all the people that were involved in Benjamin Harlow's murder... or rather, those that weren't involved enough. Anne would like to send them her regards one by one, starting with Sir Ulbrecht Brawl.","17135":"Anne now has the names of all the people that were involved in Benjamin Harlow's murder... or rather, those that weren't involved enough.

Stir the pot for Annie - arm them with yer biggest cannons, and I won't use you as live ammunition.","17164":"Anne is not happy with one of her associates. She wants you to take his feathered companion as a guarantee of his silence.","17165":"Bart is a walking cliché of a pirate - and a dead one if he doesn't learn to keep his trap shut. Bring me that annoying bird he keeps by his bedside, and I'll have one of the lads babysit it while he learns...","17166":"Anne Harlow won't allow pirate history to die - not when she finds it so entertaining! She wants timber to build her prisoners a nice catwalk into the ocean.","17167":"Some traditions should not be forgotten - certainly not one as fun as making a worm walk the plank! Bring me timber, kitty cat.","17168":"It would appear someone is speaking ill of Harlow behind her back. She wants you to make sure he's already taken his last trip to the tavern.","17169":"A goon at the tavern reckons I'm still nobility... Set him straight, biscuit-eater, in the most low-down way you're able!","17170":"Anne Harlow is fed up with Lord Spillikin's entitled abuse of power. She'd like you to put him in his place.","17171":"There's none more entitled than Lord Spillikin, greasy hands in paupers' pockets. How about we give him a bit of the special treatment he thinks himself so worthy of?","17172":"A haven for dragonflies.","17173":"A fascinating power emanates from its eyes.","17174":"Royals love their beluga caviar - and Anne loves to see royals crying over their aristocratic whimsies. Cut off their supply of fish eggs, and show Anne evidence as proof.","17175":"Royals care more for their beluga eggs than their human doormats. Do me a favour, and cut off their supply. We'll watch them bawl out their eyes, with nothing to hoover up their piggy noses.","17176":"No good fate awaits those who dare desert Anne Harlow's gang. She's sent you to deliver the penalty.","17177":"Sparing deserters makes me every bit as weak as them. Besides, the slippery eel knows my plans! Show 'em what becomes of cowards! Or I'll have to show you...","17178":"No trade route is secluded enough to slip away from Anne's grasp. She's sent you to deliver that message to every merchant who thinks they can outsmart her.","17179":"There's nowhere to hide when you don't pay Annie. No route we won't find and strip yer gizzard. Show the merchants how we value their custom.","17180":"Anne's boys were unhelpfully reluctant to run a simple errand for her. They said it was hopeless, but it turns out they made it out alive. Bring them back to her, so she can teach them what real danger looks like.","17181":"A doomed mission, they said, but those chicken-livers still managed to sneak out alive. Bring them to me, and I'll make sure they recognise death's face next time.","17182":"Anne Harlow and her boys didn't bring back quite as much booty as they expected. She's sure there must be some cargo left behind.","17183":"There should be more booty here, I'm sure of it! Go back to that spot, and see if there isn't more left of that wimpy trader!","17185":"§--17185--§","17186":"One of Anne Harlow's men feel asleep on duty, and didn't notice a schooner drifting away on its own.

Now the schooner's drifted away into open seas. Fetch it, dog, while I nail this one's eyelids to his temples.","17188":"Anne Harlow has demanded you escort her mate Pixie to a safe haven. Unfortunately, Pixie's upset a lot of people, and they'll be falling over themselves to have her head the moment you let your guard down.","17189":"Pixie's success has garnered her a lot of unwanted attention. We have a place to lay low til the dust settles - but if anyone touches a hair on her head on the way there, you can wave your own goodbye.","17191":"Anne Harlow is waiting for Lady Rosalind to pay for her brother's ransom, but it seems she paid some men to rescue him instead.

Not only is Anno 1800 the seventh installment in the series, but it also marks the series' 20th anniversary.<br/><br/>20 years is a significant milestone to reach by any measure, but an especially notable one in an industry as dynamic and fast-paced as digital entertainment.<br/>","17950":"No-one could have predicted this journey back in March 1998, when an unassuming new challenger named “Anno 1602” entered the field, daring to take on the more established strategy competitors of its day.<br/><br/>And what a journey it's been!<br/><br/>Over the last 20 years, we've made our own history together. We've seen the renaissance, and the age of enlightenment. We've even travelled into the future, settled the ocean floor, and colonized the moon.<br/>","17951":"None of this would have been possible without you - the dedicated and passionate Anno fans who have inspired and empowered us every step along the way.<br/>Our community of “Annoholics” has been our driving force, and these 20 years are a testament to your enthusiasm.<br/><br/>So no matter if this is your very first Anno (and if so, welcome aboard!), or if you've been with us for two decades - THANK YOU, from the bottom of our hearts!<br/>","17952":"<br/>The Anno 1800 Development Team<br/>","17953":"You need a minimum population of investors to unlock the right to proceed.","17954":"Other Themes","17956":"Unveil Rewards","17957":"Event Completed","17958":"Some exhibitors have bought you gifts based on the success of the exhibition.","17959":"The exhibition has finished, and it didn't go quite as well as we'd hoped... Let's try and do better next time...","17960":"Total event attractiveness","17961":"Sell to Archibald Blake:","17962":"We are preparing to relocate the good people we managed to free from La Corona - but in the meantime, they all need clothes and food. Urgently.","17963":"Sometimes, it feels like we're fighting an iron giant with stones and sticks. La Corona suffocates every chance we get at developing our own technology. Our engineers are more than capable, but we don't have the means to produce the required materials. Could you help us?","17964":"La Corona is a terrible enemy, but these particular individuals are exceptionally sadistic. We cannot wait - they must be destroyed before they lay a finger on another innocent.","17965":"There's a colonial fleet coming our way! This is the worst possible timing! Please, we cannot face them alone - help us sink their warships!","17966":"According to our intel, there's a smuggler delivering weapons to La Corona's forces. We cannot allow them to grow any stronger - cut their cords!","17967":"There's been some tensions between the members of the Movement lately. It's clear to me that this mysterious colonial ship is nothing more than a poorly disguised trap, but some of my comrades are insisting we face them. I have no choice. If we want to keep the Movement united, we have to take the bait.","17968":"My comrades were captured by La Corona! Quick - find the ships and free them before they escape from our grasp! I won't let anyone else fall into their hands.","17969":"Our last skirmish against La Corona cut things a bit too fine. We managed to sink their ship, but we were too badly beaten ourselves to stay on high seas a moment longer. We know they were carrying a substantial shipment that would be incredibly useful for us - we have to get to it before they do!","17970":"I understand why everyone is on their feet, but we need to be strong and resist La Corona's taunts... Ah... At least this time, they survived... Could you go look for them, please?","17971":"§--17971--§","17972":"We're still awfully far behind La Corona in the arms race. I heard one of their warships was wrecked not too far from here. Bring us their weapons, so our engineers can try to replicate them.","17973":"Bente Jorgensen has her heart in the right place. When she heard about our struggle, she rushed to help us. I appreciate her efforts, but I fear her harmless fleet could be an easy target for La Corona. Make sure she gets out of the region safely, please.","17974":"Your Queen and I share a mutual enemy, but it is in both of our interests that La Corona doesn't find out. An imperial ship is coming our way with supplies, but I fear La Corona might intercept them. Cover them, please!","17975":"I fear my spies may have been followed. Please, escort them safely to our island - we cannot afford to lose them, nor the crucial information they've learned about our enemy.","17976":"Not a single day goes by that I don't worry about the civilians. We need to acquire new lands, to relocate the refugees away from this conflict. I've arranged a deal for a distant island, and all we have to do now is pay - but La Corona will not let our vessel leave these waters so easily...","17977":"Jean and I may have a different approach to this conflict, but we share a common enemy. We'd be having a much harder time if his people weren't pestering La Corona as much as they do. They aren't exactly having an easy time of it either, though - I know he'll appreciate some extra guns.","17978":"Some colonial scum have been obstructing my trade routes! I'm sure you'll be able to get past them, though. I've commanded my ships to drop their cargo at a designated position for you to pick up. I'll give you the coordinates.","17979":"[Online PlayerName([NotificationContext Value(Peer) Int])] joined the chat.","17980":"[Online PlayerName([NotificationContext Value(Peer) Int])] left the chat.","17981":"[Online PlayerName([NotificationContext Value(Peer) Int])] switched team to [Online PlayerTeam([NotificationContext Value(Peer) Int])]","17982":"[Online PlayerName(%i)]: ","17983":"Trade History","17984":"Oh, sweet explosions of golden orbs in my mouth! And I learned you have alchemists that extract the nectar and turn it into an enchanting beverage! May I be granted a taste?","17985":"The Princess loves grapes; they're one of her most relished pleasures. She's heard of a special beverage crafted from their juice, and cannot wait to taste it.","17986":"One of the things I miss the most is taking those long walks through the imperial gardens. I've been looking for curious and beautiful flora to garnish the grounds of my residence, and I hear Kahina has the seeds to grow pristine, cloud-like flowers.","17987":"The Princess longs to have a beautiful garden like the ones she had back home. She's heard of a beautiful flower that will fill her grounds with fluffy clouds, and would love it if you could get the seeds for her from Madame Kahina.","17988":"Oh, no... My mother sends ships carrying \"visitors\"... But I am sure their true purpose is much darker than that. Please, just... Bring them here discreetly, so I can send them back before they embarrass me.","17989":"Sir Archibald sent me a note to thank me for the cookies, but I didn't send any! It must have been my mother... I know her - there is no way this gift had good intentions. Go there, and make the cookies vanish before someone cracks them open.","17990":"Oh, the delicate perfume of brewing tea. I miss it so much it hurts to remember... There isn't a day I don't regret leaving my favourite kettle back home. I know Beryl, too, is an avid tea-drinker. Maybe she has a fine kettle she could spare me?","17991":"The Empress has sent her daughter a visiting party from home, but Qing is certain they don't mean well. She'd like you to accompany them to her harbour with the utmost discretion.","17992":"The Princess is worried that the cookies Sir Archibald received might be a less than kind present from the Empress. She's asked you to smuggle them out of High Clarence Hall, before tragedy strikes.","17993":"The Princess misses her tea dearly, but she left her kettle back home. Luckily, Beryl too loves tea, so she figured she might have a spare kettle to lend her.","17994":"I just received a report containing details of your trade history... But I didn't order it, I swear! It must have been one of my mother's uncalled-for 'favours'. The spies must be roaming your city. In the name of my family, I deeply apologise!","17995":"A beautiful flower that grows in the mountains has been haunting my dreams lately. I know I will not stop thinking about it until I can have some for my flower arrangements...","17996":"The Princess has alerted you that her mother has been sending spies to gather information about your trade partners. They lurk in the streets of your city, wearing black hooded robes.","17997":"The Princess' dreams have been haunted by a beautiful flower that only grows in the mountains. She wants to have some for her flower arrangements, but they're somewhat out of her reach.","17998":"§--17998--§","17999":"§--17999--§","18000":"At first, I couldn't see past my heartbroken fog - but now that beauty has lifted the clouds from my eyes, I can recognise wonders I never could have dreamed of. If only more travellers from my homeland would feel welcome, and dare cast their anchor here...","18001":"The greatest gift I could grant you, friend, is the peace and tranquility of listening to the soft tinkling of water running from a nice pavilion. Please try it, and let me know what you think!","18002":"Now that Princess Qing's homesickness has lifted a little, she's starting to really like the Old World. She hopes you could build a new public mooring, to welcome more visitors from her homeland.","18003":"The Princess has recommended you build a gazebo by the river, in order to experience the peace and tranquility she was so used to back home.","18004":"Father's always wanted to visit the Old World, but his obligations never allow him to leave his distinguished seat for long enough. I want to send him a piece of this land. The vessel that carries it, too, must represent the best of your culture. Do you have any suggestions?","18005":"The way it sways in the waves so majestically... Father deserves nothing less! I will command my shipyard to start its construction at once. I know you want to help - could you bring us the materials?","18006":"Nothing more beautiful ever sailed away from my shipyard. It's the perfect wrapping, but we still lack the gift... I've already had some ideas, but what would you suggest?","18007":"Friend! What a magnificent treasure we've put together. Only one more thing remains. A masterpiece from the past - something that truly represents the history of the West. Madame Kahina has a good eye for such treasures.","18008":"Oh, a present as grand as the land that inspired it, and as pre-eminent as the man that shall receive it. It is ready. Shall we gently guide this treasure home?","18009":"Princess Qing knows her father would love to leave his duties behind and travel the world. Unfortunately, the Emperor cannot afford to do so, and so she wants to send him a piece of the Old World, starting with a classical ship. Take a picture of a suitable one.","18010":"The Princess loves your suggestion of building a ship of the line, and has already begun her preparations. However, she needs your help in gathering the materials.","18011":"The ship is ready to set sail for the East, but first it needs to be filled with presents that represent the Old World. Qing looks to you for suggestions.","18012":"The Princess is elated at the gift you're helping her put together for her father, but it still requires one more thing: a treasure from the past. She'd like you to go to Madame Kahina, and look for something that fits the bill.","18013":"Qing's present for her father is finally ready to leave port. The Princess has asked that you escort it safely on its way.","18014":"Normally, I don't participate in the excitement of expeditions, but this time, they've returned with a treasure that intrigues me: a tablet written in a forgotten language. I presume Madame Kahina must speak every language, whether new or ancient...","18015":"Oh! According to Madame Kahina's translation, the writing on the map points to a place in the middle of the sea. I need to know what lies beneath the surface! Maybe you have someone on your island who's studied the oceans, and might be able to help?","18016":"Oh! This person does seem most capable of finding out what it is the tablet speaks of. I will mark the place on your map - let's see what you discover.","18017":"I wouldn't believe it if I didn't hold them in my hands... Ancient scrolls, sealed under water for centuries! I will ask Madame Kahina to study them and produce their translations. I cannot wait to read these forgotten words! In the meantime, you can have the originals, as reward for all your efforts.","18018":"Princess Qing's expedition has brought back an enigmatic tablet written in an old language. She'd like to know more about it, and thinks Madame Kahina may be able to tell you more.","18019":"The tablet found by Princess Qing's expedition seems to mark a place in the middle of the ocean. She'd like you to ask around your harbour, and see if you can find someone who can help you.","18020":"You found a diver that will be able to search the ocean for whatever lies beneath the waves. The Princess has marked the spot on your map - go forth, and bring her what you find.","18021":"All Items","18022":"Ship Items","18023":"Trade Union Items","18024":"Harbourmaster Items","18025":"Town Hall Items","18026":"Our New Year is fast approaching! I would love to commemorate this passing of the year with something that represents both the fragility of time, and the technological advances of the era. Do you have anything in mind?","18027":"How could you!? Clocks are terrible luck, especially if given as a gift for the New Year! I guess as a foreigner, you cannot be blamed... I know what you can do, though. I need some fine cloth to decorate the streets. Think you can you provide that?","18028":"Oh, dear... How could you bring me white cloth!? This is a festival, not a funeral! Maybe just bring me some sweet refreshments, then. I don't see how you could go wrong with that...","18029":"Grapes! What a pleasant surprise! This time you hit the nail right on its head: they symbolise abundance and prosperity. Thank you for all your help and efforts - now the New Year festival may begin!","18030":"The Princess is undergoing preparations for the New Year celebrations. She'd like to have something that represents both technology and time.","18031":"Your last gift for Qing was not at all appropriate. Instead, she's asked you to deliver cloth to provide decorations for the New Year's festival.","18032":"White cloth is a terribly bad omen to Princess Qing! You might get luckier with something to eat - something small and sweet, like a coveted fruit.","18034":"Willie is yet again afraid that some vengeful spirits have returned to collect their dues from him, having sighted them near his shores. He hopes you can banish them.","18035":"Willie is bursting with pride over his newly-opened factory - he just wishes his mum could have seen it. Take a photo for Willie, and maybe she'll get her chance at one of his special \"spiritual evenings\".","18036":"Willie is disgusted that you haven't yet got round to building a variety theatre, at which he might be able to tour with his magic show. He suggests you organise one as soon as humanly possible.","18037":"Willie recommends you invite Barnfield's Circus to your town, in order to spread happiness among your people. You'll need to build a big tent first, for which you'll need some light and cloth.","18038":"Wilie thinks Barnfield's Circus can only recover its former glory if the existing freak show is replaced by the arrival of a performing elephant.","18039":"Willie hopes that by escorting Barnfield's circus troupe to your harbour, the circus spectacular can begin. Watch out though - Barnfield's reputation as a ruthless ringmaster means he has his enemies.","18040":"Accept","18041":"Willie has, perhaps foolishly, challenged a rival magician to a conjuring competition. As usual, he's in desperate need of your assistance. For this trick, he's asked you to deliver a lot of glass.","18042":"Willie's \"Pepper Ghost\" trick was a colossal failure. He finally accepts he might have been too ambitious, and plumps for a supposedly simpler trick. He needs you to bring him a bowler hat.","18043":"Having clearly lost the magic showdown, Willie does not enjoy being the subject of ridicule. Instead, he asks that you make his rival disappear once and for all.","18044":"Willie would like you to bring him some tobacco. He says it serves as an important reminder of the sacrifices his late mother made to get him where he is.","18045":"Willie wants you to deliver him some fish oil to help keep his people fit and healthy. After all, that's where he gets all his strength from...","18046":"Willie finally admits that what he's been missing all this time is someone to look after him and comfort him. Perhaps what he really means is someone willing to mop up his messes for him.","18047":"Willie tells you the story of how he became rich, having found a sizeable treasure which he now keeps under lock and key. The fact he doesn't know who it originally belonged to, however, has been keeping him awake at night. He thinks a vengeful spirit is haunting his lighthouse, and wants you to take photographic proof.","18048":"Vicente's battalion has been awarded a medal by the King of La Corona. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing war effort at home, they could not afford to manufacture the medals to present them. Disgusted, Vicente asks you to deliver the materials to him, so that he can pin them on his men himself.","18049":"A medal, the king said, for services to La Corona. Well... I see no sign of it yet - and I know why. The empire doesn't have enough metal to equip the army, that's why. Never mind us war heroes, flogging this dead horse of an empire. It's an insult! Bring me some metal, and we'll mint the damn medals ourselves!","18050":"King Alfonso, Vicente's superior and La Corona's head-of-state, is angry that the Queen is hogging the best fish and fishing grounds. Vicente has asked you, as a neutral, to sink a merchant vessel in the sound where the so-called poachers have most often been spotted. He needs proof to take back to the King.","18051":"Vicente wants to enlist you as a mercenary to fight in the wars against the rebels that are trying to break away from the Old World Empire of La Corona that Vicente ostensibly serves. From Vicente's tone, this seems to be a critical coming together, so you ought to be well-prepared.","18052":"Vicente wants you to look for the rebel commander, who was not counted among the dead in a recent battle, and whom he therefore believes may still be hiding in the sea where the battle took place. If you find him alive, there can be only one course of action.","18053":"Vicente wants you to destroy a small trade ship carrying some street urchins he knows have stolen from him, even though the spoils of war they stole have already been moved on to their master. Vicente seems to have given up on tracing this mastermind, and is content for you to take his frustrations out on those immediately responsible.","18054":"Vicente has given you the great honour of going into battle first. The aim: to destroy at least some of the enemy fleet, so that he can pick off the rest with ease.","18055":"Vicente wants you to track down some deserters of La Corona. It seems he has a zero tolerance policy towards those who try to escape active duty, and intends to have them lined up and shot.","18056":"La Corona is losing on every front, but what is King Alfonso's greatest concern? Fish. He likes eating fish - but the Queen's fishermen keep drifting closer and closer to our waters. Of course, it makes no sense for me to start a war over it. What a crazy idea! You start it. And bring me proof.","18057":"There is going to be a small skirmish. It's unavoidable, but very winnable. If you were to take part - as a mercenary, of course - it might just give us the edge over those pathetic rebels. Of course, you're a mercenary - you probably don't care who you kill - so it may as well be for La Corona!","18058":"Well, we put them to the sword of course - but that made the waters course with blood and splintered timber, which made finding the enemy commander all the more difficult. If he's not among the dead, the clever fellow must still be out there, hiding at the site of the battle! Execute him.","18059":"I have had the entire hoard from the battle of Cape Chance stolen from me by some devil-spawn adolescents, and given to whoever their gutter-born Fagin is. Needless to say, it won't be happening again! If they're old enough to steal, they're old enough to suffer for it - so go and make them suffer!","18061":"There's more than one way to skin a cat. Young boys go in full of bravado, climbing over the trench walls with the ephemeral spirit of life aflutter in their breast, knowing this will be all or nothing. Those of higher rank stand a safe distance away, and pick off what remains of the enemy, before returning to their bunker for coffee and pastries.","18062":"You've given Willie proof of the phantom that stalks him, but now he wants your help to drive it away. Bring him some holy water from one of his baptismal fonts.","18063":"You know what I do to deserters? I do the kindest thing it is in my power to do. I have them executed. What kind of life awaits them otherwise? Knowing they have failed their family and friends. Failing to defend the nation they swore to defend; failing at being real men. You'd better bring them back here, hadn't you.","18064":"Willie now has the holy water with which to face his demons, but unfortunately finds himself falling asleep. Could you help keep him and his soldiers awake with coffee?","18065":"You are to pursue the mysterious phantom aboard his phantom ship, as Willie's quest to protect his fortune comes to its spooky conclusion.","18066":"The phantom haunting Willie turns out to be nothing more than a few of the board's cronies, hiding under a sheet trying to play on his conscience. You should return the sheet to Willie as proof he has nothing to fear after all.","18068":"I've probably told you already, but I do miss my mum. She might have been big and frightening, not to mention occasionally violent, but I was a real nincompoop back in those days. I deserved all of it. You know what reminds me of her the most? Raw tobacco from her evening pipe. Sends a shiver down my spine, it does.","18069":"...me old mum used to take good care of me when I was sick, too. I remember those days in me straw bed, supping on stale— er, crusty — bread, and gobbling down spoon after spoon of fish oil. Wonderful. Perhaps if you have any of the old stuff, I could give a little something back to the sick and needy, in honour of me mum.","18070":"I don't believe in coincidences. Those ships in the sea nearby must belong to the spirits I've seen; their eyes emitting a pale blue light, cheeks drawn and skeletal. Blow 'em up, would you?","18072":"Oh, if only my old mum could see my assembly line... It was only a thousand over budget! Hang on a minute... maybe she could? If you take a photograph, I could use the power invested in me to show her it during our next seance!","18073":"What do you mean you haven't got a variety theatre? It's on my tour bill — the 2nd, the 17th and the 24th you said! We were all really eager to come by with our astonishing new act, so you'd better be ready!","18074":"Like I said, Mum used to do a lot for me. Keep my socks together, comb my hair, rinse my bedpan. I don't have anyone like that around me now. D'you think, maybe... you could find me someone? Not a replacement, like — I mean no-one can replace mum. Ha ha.","18075":"As a man almost great as me once said, \"the noblest art is that of making yourself happy\". I had Barnfield's Circus come to town and cheer me up — and you should too, since you're looking so down. First, they'll need a big top!","18076":"Barnfield is making the tent as we speak! Sadly, he was telling me yesterday that his freak show hasn't really drawn in the crowds as of late. What he really needs is an elephant! That'll really trumpet a new era of success.","18077":"Everything's set for your circus! All you need to do is to escort Barnfield and his troupe to your harbour, and let the festivities begin! Watch out though - there's a few animal rights people mooching around, angry about the business with the elephant...","18078":"The Ethereal Edwin Hartebeest shall vanish from the conjuring scene once he sees the wonderful Willie waving his wand! I shall win this magical tournament in whichever way I can. For my first joust, I'm going to need a lot of glass.","18079":"How was I supposed to know which bit was air and which bit was glass? Anyway, it's going to be an absolute nightmare to clean it all up - and all while my rival Hartebeest conjures up something devastating! I need a quick and easy follow-up trick. Bring me a hat.","18080":"Impossible! How did he do that! Now everyone's calling my act rubbish. I call upon you, my faithful assistant, to excommunicate this dark wizard! And also... find out how his tricks are done...","18081":"Never told you how I made my fortune, did I. Well... I found something. A great treasure. Quite near the family home, actually. No idea who it belonged to - but only now do I learn it's been foretold that one day, its owner shall return and take bloody vengeance upon me! Only yesterday, there were reports of a shadow stalking about my lighthouse. Perhaps you could catch the phantom on film?","18082":"THERE IT IS! I KNEW IT! Now you've no reason to disbelieve me like everyone else does. We must find a way to dispel this ghost. Hey! What about holy water? From my church, like?","18083":"You know when you're so afraid, it makes you sleepy? Well, there's no point us having holy water to fight the phantom if we've fallen asleep when it floats nearby. Have you got anything to help keep our eyes pinned open?","18084":"The ghost! I saw him, I swear! He was here in my room, white as a sheet over my bed, and wailing madly! I threw some holy water at him, and he yelped and flew from my window to his ghostly ship! What does he want with me? Please, help me face this spirit and try to reason with him!","18085":"Oi, take it easy! Since you've managed to catch us, you must be a bit sharper upstairs than your chum Willie. Obviously, we're not vengeful spirits that walk the earth - just some hired hands they paid to put the fear of god up him. Here's the sheet we were under - take it as \"proof\" if you want. He still won't believe you.","18086":"I didn't think he'd attack if he saw me little regulars on board! Lucky they're all good swimmers. I've underestimated that Vicente - he's almost as heartless as I am. Hah! Only joking. He's a softie compared to me.","18087":"<b>Struthionidae.</b> A big bird with a good kick.","18088":"<b>Phoenicopterus roseus.</b> Fed carrots to keep their feathers pink.","18089":"<b>Crocodylinae.</b> Little birds help clean their giant teeth.","18090":"Vicente is an avid reader, though naturally preoccupied by the subject of war. He's heard in the officer's mess of a new book, written in your language about the art of war, and wishes for you to bring it to him.","18091":"Vicente has suffered a humiliating defeat. Still licking his wounds, he would like you to recover anything you can from the battlefield. It is his belief that, like with pastry, if at first you don't succeed, you should simply gather your scraps together, and try and roll the whole thing out afresh.","18092":"Vicente has no time for love among the ranks, and is rather irritated to discover the surveillance information he's been waiting for has been delayed by a lovers' tryst. He can't face the tedious lovebirds himself, so he asks you to extract it from them instead.","18093":"Find the commander whose men mutinied against him, and bring him before Vicente Silva. Vicente believes having the commander watch his men pay the penalty for insubordination may help in his natural development as a leader.","18094":"We learn the basics from an early age, if we want to command. We attend fine military academies, we read all there is to read. Only then do we have the field upon which to pitch the tent of strategy. Find me a copy of \"Leadership after Nadasky\", and help me take the high ground.","18095":"Sometimes, when you take your big rolling pin - hnngh - and you roll out your pastry, it starts to crack up - hnggh. Bits... falling, on the floor. Hnngh. But you can't let that beat you. No! You have to pick up the pastry, SQUISH it up into a great big ball once more, and roll the blasted thing out again! HNNGH. Hnnggh. Hnggh.","18096":"Good soldiers all too often find themselves distracted by the opposite sex. Those two lovelorn bores have been withholding surveillance information which is vital to the final victory of La Corona, and I need you to put the two pieces of the puzzle together!","18097":"Mutiny, that's what it is! Unheard of! Hnnghh. Hnggh. One of my most subservient commanders, tossed into the sea by his own men. Find him, and bring him back here. I want him to be there for the court marshal and subsequent execution of his men, so he can witness how his weak leadership has caused this whole fiasco!","18098":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18099":"Beryl has a new competitor, someone who goes by the name of \"The Cat\". She wants you to send him to sleep with the fishes.","18100":"The Cat survived your attack. Beryl wants you to try again, and make sure he doesn't come back.","18101":"The Cat returned, again! As much as Beryl's enjoying her enemy's unexpected resilience, she expects this will be the last of his nine lives.","18102":"Beryl was betrayed. Normally, she can see these things coming - but this time, she was caught unawares. She wonders what was different this time, and has asked you to investigate the perpetrators.","18103":"Some of Beryl's urchins were captured! They're being taken to the workhouse, but Beryl won't let anyone take them away!","18104":"Some of Beryl's collaborators were apprehended. While she thinks it's a pity, she still needs to make sure they keep their mouths shut, forever.","18105":"Some of Beryl's rivals are sailing into her territory. They've brought about their own demise, though, as she's not about to let them through so easily.","18106":"Beryl has accidentally dropped her cargo in the middle of the ocean. She'd like you to retrieve it and take it back to her, if you'd be so kind.","18107":"Beryl would like you to escort a very large shipment of local fish. It must be very fresh, as it doesn't smell of fish at all.","18108":"Beryl has introduced you to an old friend of hers, and has asked you to escort him safely back home. That being said, she didn't sound quite like her usual self when she was giving her instructions...","18109":"Beneath Beryl's facade of resoluteness lies a woman of deep faith. A preacher is paying her island a visit, and Beryl wants nothing but the best for the man, starting with a warm welcome at sea.","18110":"Wedding bells are ringing - although not on Beryl's island, but yours. As the law dictates, the couple cannot take their vows within the territory of either of the reconciling families.","18111":"Beryl is awaiting a ship from Princess Qing's mother, the Empress. It's contents are of the upmost importance, and she wants you to escort it safely into her harbour.","18112":"Beryl needs some crates delivered, and fast. What's in them? You don't need to know.","18113":"Isabel Sarmento is the passionate leader of a rebellion in the New World which people call \"The Movement\", striving for independence from Old World empires.<br/>She lost her brother to the violence, but this only seems to have strengthened her resolve. She knows her people will have to fight clever if they want to build a lasting future for themselves.","18114":"Eli Bleakworth is a deeply resentful servant of the crown, charged with governing Wormways Prison, a depraved and isolated facility.<br/>Taking great pleasure in carrying out punishments, he is strict and unbending, believing the scum receive only what they deserve. Suspicious to the core, he will no doubt be keeping his beady eyes on you too!","18115":"To even browse Kahina's emporium can feel like a privilege, so luxurious are her exotic displays.<br/>But to Kahina, this whole enterprise is rather humdrum - a compromise for her comfort and safety, and one that seems desperately dull in comparison to the daredevil life of intrigue and prestige that she once led.","18116":"Vicente is paranoid about the activities of Lady Margaret Hunt, who he believes is meddling in his business more than ever. You are to provide escort for three of his ships bearing armaments, and report anything that might connect an attack with Hunt back to him.","18117":"Vicente wants you to escort his fleet into position undamaged, so that they are in tip-top condition for a pitched battle with yet more of La Corona's rebels .","18118":"The old lady is plotting against me, I'm sure of it! My last three shipments of weapons were destroyed the moment they rounded the bay. This time, you'll be there to escort them, and you are to report any, ANY suggestion that Margaret Hunt is involved.","18119":"I know they can more than handle themselves, but my fleet are just too busy and too important to be distracted by enemy outriders. That's where the grunts like you come in and take one for the team. Now, hurry, for the hour of triumph is near!","18120":"Beryl's customers love animals. She wants you to take a few pets to their new owners.","18121":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18122":"Beryl loves horses, and enjoys watching the magnificent animals run. But she's not all that pleased with the last jockey she put her money on. She wants you to take him a present, to encourage him to do a better job next time.","18123":"Beryl has requested you go find something that Sir Archibald has prepared for her at High Clarence Hall. But, just in case, she would prefer if no one were to see you take it.","18124":"Beryl O'Mara has come to like you more than both of you anticipated. She wants to show you she cares about you, so she has a little present for you.","18125":"Beryl fears that Willie Wibblesock might not have been following her advice entirely.

You still don't know what kind of task she's escaped from, but Beryl has asked you to bring her back.","18135":"Beryl is planning a wedding - her daughter's, to be precise. But it looks like the bride's not the only one who's not happy with the arrangement. The groom's life might be in danger if he's not escorted safely to her island.","18136":"The groom has arrived safely on Beryl's island. Now all that's left to do before the ceremony is for her to provide the weapons she promised to the groom's family.","18137":"Everything is ready for the wedding, but Scarlet will not comply until her mother speaks to Charles, the family's old priest.","18138":"As Beryl anticipated, the Butchers are retaliating for her calling off the wedding. With their eldest son in her custody, and you fighting by her side, she's confident you'll deliver a blow that will make the O'Mara name feared and respected like never before.","18139":"Vicente wants you to scout ahead and photograph the rebel fleet in formation, believing this will enable him to develop a strategy for his attack.","18140":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18141":"Someone thinks he can best Beryl at her own game. Calls himself \"The Cat\", the poor thing. He'll have plenty o'fish on the bottom of the ocean!","18142":"Didn't you make sure The Cat was in the bag? He's still purring down my neck, dearie! Strike again. And this time, make sure he goes down with the rest.","18143":"How in the world!? The Cat's back again! Oh, I haven't had this much fun in a very long time. Let's go - we'll make sure this is the last of his nine lives!","18144":"No-one ever catches me off guard. But somehow, I didn't see this backstab coming. I'm curious - how did they manage it? I need you to investigate, for future reference.","18145":"Me little urchins are mistaken for helpless orphans all the time, but normally they avoid being taken to the workhouse. They were bested this time, but we won't let them be taken - will we, dear?","18146":"How unfortunate. I was, to an extent, rather fond of these collaborators of mine. But they got caught. Such a pity - they were rather good at their job. Happens to the best of us, I suppose. But we can't afford to have them going blabbing now, can we?","18147":"The nerve of these people, prancing like goose on my waters. One would assume they know better than to paint a target on their foreheads, am I right?","18148":"Oh, what a clumsy old lady I've become. My feeble hands made me drop my cargo in the middle of the sea! What's in the crates? Nothing but honest bread and potatoes for my poor dear people, of course!","18149":"Our local fish are splendid. Served in every reception room worthy of notice, if you catch me drift. We've received a rather large order, though, and I wouldn't want this coveted delicacy to fall into the hands of pirates now, would I?","18150":"Oh, dearie, did I ever tell you about my good old friend, Sergio? We just had the most interesting of discussions. Nothing should happen to him on his way back home, oh no. Nothing at all...","18151":"Only faith has brought me comfort in difficult times. Pater Fidias has shown interest in visiting us, and he will be received here with the greatest of honour. You wouldn't mind keeping the good man safe on his way to do his holy duty, would you?","18152":"War feeds science, and science feeds war. Let us make use of the latest fad for photography, and capture the enemy formation in situ! Reconnaissance is a key part of good strategy - if I know how the enemy have deployed themselves, I'll know almost immediately how to crush them!","18153":"A lifelong rivalry will finally come to a lovely end today. Ah, what better way to unite two families than a wedding? Still, the law does say that the nuptials must take place on neutral soil. You wouldn't mind lending the bride and groom a small patch of your island for their special day, would you, dearie?","18154":"I like the Empress' style. A ship that bears her seal is on its way here to ensure Qing receives certain... benefits I can grant. It'd be a shame if its cargo were to get lost at sea...","18155":"Oh, good, you're right on time! Do me a favour, and take these crates out of the region, quick! What's in them? Haha, only ten tonnes of none-of-yer-damn-business, sweetheart!","18156":"You'd be surprised how many people in my circle love animals, in every possible way! Here, make sure these fluffy pets arrive safely at their new homes.","18157":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18158":"Don't you love horses? I adore horses. Specially when they win for Beryl. This jockey, though, could use a little encouragement. Would you mind delivering him a little present from me? Careful, it's delicate!","18159":"How sweet of Sir Archibald to take care of an old lady like me. He's prepared something for me at his harbour, but I wouldn't want anyone to believe I enjoy a preferential treatment from the Queen... Could you go pick it up for me, dear?","18160":"I keep my enemies close, and my friends even closer! Your help has been invaluable as of late, dear. Take this as a small token of my affection. And please, drop by every once in a while and have a tea with old Beryl.","18161":"Ah, poor, dear Willie. I so often worry if he's doing alright. I just can't help it! I gave him some advice on how he should be running things on his island, but I worry he might not have got it quite right yet. Could you take a picture there and show me?","18162":"Vicente is regretting his decision to ally with you, noticing that you only have a tiny fleet. He suggests you hurry up and build two frigates, or he might have to think twice about the arrangement.","18163":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18164":"Vicente is mildly disappointed to discover you aren't currently much of an ally, thanks to the lack of weapons factories at your disposal. He suggests you do something about it, or the alliance between you could come to an abrupt end.","18165":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18166":"I had to sacrifice so much to dig us back up from the dirt after Walter passed. We had to come back from the city and fend for ourselves. And now Scarlet, that brat, can't even do one simple thing for her mother... Bring her back, please.","18167":"Thank you for bringing her back. Don't worry - I'll make sure this spoiled young woman is ready for her nuptials. The groom is on his way, but there are still some brows frowning upon this wedding, and it's quite essential that he arrives here in one piece, dearie.","18168":"Good - all set! Now, I have only one more thing to ask of you. See, my side of the deal involves providing a not insubstantial amount of weapons for this other family, but my production has been rather slow as of late. I'll be needing a few more, if you don't mind.","18169":"You got the weapons? Good, good... Now the Butchers will settle down. Scarlet's refusing to leave her room unless our old priest, Charles, officiates the ceremony. She's insisting I speak to him. I'm already up to my eyebrows - could you find him for me?","18170":"Every day, I ask myself, what is the point of our alliance? Your fleet is pathetic! If I'd known I'd be joined at the hip to a loser, I'd never have signed our agreement! Now buck up your ideas, or I shall rapidly withdraw from this misguided arrangement.","18171":"At no point when signing our alliance did you volunteer the fact you have not a single weapons manufactory in your possession! What kind of namby-pamby, lettuce-luncher are you?! Cobble something together at once, or I shall tear our alliance into ticker tape, and sprinkle it over your yellow jelly custard!","18172":"Well, colour me surprised. The Butchers sent a fleet to destroy Beryl the betrayer! They forget I still have their eldest son! Haha, let's sink them, dearie. No one will dare go against the O'Maras ever again!","18173":"I... Oh, how could I have been so blind? The priest reminded me of my dear Walter. He would never have approved of giving our daughter away to a horrible family like the Butchers. I'm going to call off the wedding. And we'd better prepare - I doubt they'll take the news kindly.","18174":"Oh, so he DID arrive unharmed!? You idio—!... *sigh* Never mind. Guess I can count on you the next time I need a lovely little zealous watchdog, pet.","18175":"I would like you to deliver this letter to Bente Jorgensen. A beautiful woman should always be accompanied by an upright chaperone, born of a noble family - ideally one from overseas - who can do the difficult job of thinking for them, advising the best use of whatever small means they have.","18176":"Everyone knows Bente needs protecting. So, why shouldn't I be the one to look after her? I am the best-equipped, after all. As they say, there's nothing a woman likes more than a man in uniform!","18177":"Bente loves animals, I know that much. If she and I are really going to have a future together, we need to put those animals to use - at the circus! Please deliver her my, er... business proposition!","18178":"A fitting welcome for my menagerie of peculiarities! Much better than that interfering Wibblesock - he's really been walking a tightrope with me!!","18179":"Ohhh! Cables and mirrors is how he did it, eh? Ha! Well, no point wasting the secret of his spectacle now he's gone, is there?! By the way, you make an excellent assistant. Would you be interested in a more permanent role? You'll get a Wibble Soc. badge!","18180":"Mmm... Still tastes... like childhood, doesn't it? I feel like I'm running down memory lane, my backside burning from the cane all over again.","18181":"A prank? White sheets? Nooooo! You think I, a noteworthy magician, would not have absolute faith in what I saw in that photograph? On the occasion of that fearful visitation? I must remain vigilant. Still, I appreciate all you've done for me. You've gone to great lengths for Willie and the Wibble Society, and I must acknowledge that. Did you get your badge in the post?","18182":"Gasparov has been left infuriated yet again by the persistence of pirates during guided tours of his island's unique monuments and sights. He hopes you are able to provide an escort, and sweep any ne'erdowells out of sight if they pop up during the tour.","18183":"Gasparov wishes to modernise the public sculptures in his city, and has identified several sculptures he'd like you to dismantle, which he believes to be artistically obsolete.","18184":"Vicente would like you to deliver a proposal of an alliance to Bente Jorgensen on his behalf. Judging by his attitude, it seems unlikely even Bente would accept...","18185":"The rather oppressive Vicente Silva has asked you to deliver some weapons to Bente Jorgensen, to indicate his supposed goodwill. You doubt it's a gift she'll be happy to receive.","18186":"From Vicente? Oh, how terrible! I mean, normally I welcome those extending the olive branch to be companions of mine. But he's just such an arse...","18187":"Yuck, yuck, no, no! Get the repulsive things away from me! As I have told Vicente a thousand times, I'm a pacifist — although I'm starting to wonder if I should make an exception when it comes to him. Sometimes, I really feel like bopping him on the head with my brolly!","18188":"One of Gasparov's prized collections of hats seems to have gone missing, and its absence from his wardrobe is beginning to hurt him. It would be a great service to him if you could recover them.","18189":"Gasparov would like to have a troupe of musicians play for him when he has his baths. Bring him some willing performers to add a little romance to his evening rinse.","18190":"Gasparov would like you to organise a fashion event for him, for which you'll need to provide: escort for several noteable designers; a suitably chi-chi audience; and models that are pleasing to the eye.","18191":"Gasparov would like to reaffirm his feelings of self-confidence, which are known on very rare occasions to dip temporarily. He's invited you to collect some of his adoring fans, so he can spend the evening hearing their fawning praise, and thereby restore his ego to maximum.","18193":"Gasparov has made some fine invitations for some persons of high culture he wishes to attend one of his current exhibitions. He calls upon you to deliver them with great care.","18194":"Gasparov is disappointed that an Eastern princess has confiscated a trio of exquisite vases so they can be returned to their point of origin. He would like you to bribe those tasked with returning the vases, so that he can restore them to display in his galleries.","18195":"Gasparov would like you to ensure that a school of fragile ballerinas are kept safe from harm while in transit to his conservatoire, where they are to enjoy a formal performance routine from the master himself. Gasparov hopes that through ballet, some connection to the grandeur of the past can be preserved, even in times of great change.","18196":"Gasparov is tortured by the possibility that followers of the despotic Alonso Graves freely roam his city, and that this heralds a coming apocalypse. He asks you to find them, and remove them from his city before the fall of man begins.","18197":"Gasparov is embarrassed to discover you have no monument to show off to the world, and recommends you start constructing one, if you don't want to be left behind.","18198":"Gasparov wants you to prove you can maintain your cellars of champagne. Having only a few bottles here and there just makes you look like a society fraud!","18199":"Gasparov is disgusted at the number of statues in your city that were not designed by him, and wants you to destroy these false idols at once.","18200":"Unsurprisngly, Gasparov wants you to build the statues he designed, rather than those of his rivals. He also wants you to do it right away.","18201":"Gasparov is looking for a cover image of his island to sell a few copies of his newspaper. He believes the sheer beauty of such a photograph, taken by you, cannot fail to win over any of his doubters.","18202":"Reluctant as always to leave his work and his island, Gasparov would like a photograph of your monument so that he can assimilate anything he deems worthy into his own designs. At least he's honest.","18203":"None have I wanted to beat more than Graves. That traitor to soldiering — for which master, it matters not — tampers with the basic principles on which we are founded; the pyramid of society from highest to lowest. I want you to lure him into the open, and send a barge up the river to his heart of sin.","18204":"Collect a renowned painter by the name of Van Ruff from Sir Archibald's island, and safely transport him to Gasparov so that he can capture the great man in portrait.","18205":"An exasperated Gasparov wants you to track down the thieves who stole Van Ruff's paintings. Once they are returned to the artist, he might agree to produce Gasparov's portrait.","18206":"On discovering the thieves have already sold off all of Van Ruff's best pieces, Gasparov suggests you visit Madame Kahina, whose knowledge in the area of high value art auctions is unsurpassed.","18207":"His paintings returned, Van Ruff has agreed to produce Gasparov's portrait, and is currently in the mountains, soaking up the inspiration. Gasparov has asked for an update on his progress.","18208":"Gasparov has heard of a particularly special tailor who knows how to make the most of cheap materials, and wants to see what she has to offer in person. He wants you to escort her to his island.","18209":"Though the materials she's requested to work with are expensive, Gasparov is full of admiration for the bravery of the new tailor. In particular, the minimalism of her style. He asks you to find her what she needs in order to create him his own bespoke garment.","18210":"Gasparov is naked - totally naked. It seems that instead of weaving him an outfit, the tailor he trusted has simply run off with all the riches you provided. Yet Gasparov seems blissfully unaware, and asks you to take a photograph of him in his \"new clothes\", so that this... enduring image can be shared with all.","18211":"I will not have my island tour ruined by pirates yet again! Those barbarians don't realise the importance of my guests being fully immersed in my work, so as to form a meaningful connection with it! I want you to escort the group, ensuring only the right sort of people are among them!","18212":"Gargoyles and meat-limbed eyesores! I don't know what whoever built these sculptures was thinking! Tear them down this instant!","18213":"Where have you been?! My darlings are lost! Lost, I tell you! An entire collection of made-to-measure hats and headpieces that cannot be replaced! The last time I saw them, they were in excellent condition, and still more than capable of impressing that feeling of timeless grandeur upon all who lay eyes upon them.","18214":"Bath time is a time of reflection for me. I watch as ideas evolve in the sparkle of the water, glimpsing beauty in the mirrors and mosaic tiles. To hear music then could only heighten the sweetness of that self-absorption, as if my genius were resonating with the gently-strummed lyre of Apollo himself.","18215":"Dr. Fraud has suggested I hold more social gatherings and events, so that I remain in regular contact with other... people. I have chosen you to prepare a festival of fashion in my city, for which I want the finest clothes, and therefore, the finest designers. Oh, and there'll no doubt be a few accessory tasks as well.","18216":"I have been receiving some critique as of late that I've taken rather to heart. I think I need someone to massage my ego - to tell me I'm wonderful, even though I know it already. I keep a little circle of adulators I like to call upon for such occasions. Bring them here safely, so I can hear my name spoken on glowing terms once more.","18217":"I have taken the utmost care in having these card invitations to my upcoming design exhibition printed. It is therefore upon you, as a common courtesy, to keep these very fine etchings from smudging, bending or creasing in any regard, as you deliver them to the chosen few.","18218":"I cannot bear to see such beauty torn away from those specially-commissioned pedestals! I don't care if her people made those vases in the first place - they've changed hands a hundred times since, and yet this is the first time anyone's expressed any regret that they were missing! What I'm trying to say is, why me?! Please, persuade them somehow to relent!","18219":"Where are the ballerinas? Only they have the power, in this era of tumult, to leap gracefully over the terrible chasm between tradition and modernity! I shall have to do some stretching beforehand of course - it has been a while - but I hope these young and fragile talents aspire, at least in some part, to my degree of mastery over the form. ","18220":"I see civilisation crumbling in their bloodshot eyes; great monuments to thought and ideas toppled by their scabby hands. The followers of Graves must be removed from this sacred place, before they incite some barbarous counter-movement, based on nothing more substantial than a skull motif!","18221":"Grand monuments are an opportunity for eminent persons to show they belong among the elite. I suggest you get yourself one - or the foundations, at the very least - unless you intend to diminish evermore into insignificance?","18222":"I am still cringing from hearing the news about your stocks of champagne. Have you any idea how embarrassing it is in polite society to not have a full and complete cellar of vintage? First impressions are everything, everything!","18223":"The shame of it! I make the most beautiful statues in the known world - most likely, even the unknown world too - and yet you insist on parading the feeble stone splodges of my rivals? I don't think I shall be able to rest until you've smashed them all to tiny bits!","18224":"Since your city is unsullied by the hideous statues of my contemporaries, why not take this opportunity to build something of genuine verve and elegance? If that's not clear enough, I mean I want you to build my statues on every street corner!","18225":"So, Vicente wants to beat us out of the trees, does he? Like his drab pheasants falling limp into the brush at his estate. No, that's no good. Please, destroy his ship and return it to him. I have no desire to be part of his petty pantomimes.","18226":"My island is so picturesque at the moment, it's simply begging to be photographed. I cannot even begin to imagine how many copies the next newspaper edition would sell based on having my island on the cover alone. So set up your camera, please, and remember that I will hold you personally responsible if you fail to capture its essential beauty!","18227":"I can't spare time to visit, of course, but I still want to see your monument, so I can decide in which respect I want to massively improve upon it. Bring me a photograph that shows the edifice from all angles, so I can cherry pick any ideas I deem worthy of iteration.","18228":"It's the name that I like more than anything: Van Ruff. I haven't seen any of his work, but from the reports of Sir Archibald, I'd be a fool not to have him attempt my portrait! Bring him here, so I may sit for him.","18229":"The heathen is refusing to paint me! Something about not showing his work in public again after thieves stole his paintings! Excuses, excuses and yet more excuses! Return Van Ruff's paintings to him, and I will have my portrait!","18230":"Those artless brigands have already sold off Van Ruff's pieces, and at ludicrous valuations! I can only think Madame Kahina might have some knowledge of the movements and whereabouts of work of that magnitude.","18231":"Finally, with most of his work returned, Van Ruff has agreed to paint me. He is in the mountains at the moment, finalising his sketchwork. I'm very busy, as always - can you check in and see how things are progressing?","18232":"I have heard rumour of a tailor who can produce the most fabulous garments from the humblest of materials. I've always admired good clothes, so please, could you bring her here.","18233":"She's quite something that tailor. You see, the material she showed me is luminous enough to be almost imperceptible, so finely woven it is. Of course, she says she'll rely only on the finest materials - as the best always do - when fashioning me a costume of my very own to wear. Would you hurry along and source the materials she needs?","18234":"The tailor says it looks absolutely perfect on me! Perfect! Everyone I've shown it to has lowered their heads, in what can only be described as deference to the divine! No matter that it was so expensive - what matters now is that I am so photogenic! Please, capture me on film, so that the world may embrace the emperor's new look!","18235":"Hnggh. A coward, and no surprise! It was cowardice that drove him into hiding, and until the day he is ready to face his crimes against the good name of soldiering, a coward he will remain!","18236":"Vicente believes he's found a natural nemesis in Alonso Graves - a man who has done what no soldier should do, and gone against his country. Vicente is rather taken aback by Alonso's unpredictable nature, however, and hopes you can deliver a message to bait him out into the open.","18237":"Sadly, it is Vicente who has never turned to face the light. To shake the confines of his own human ignorance. To feel his face burn with the intensity of his own disgust, and emerge on the other side, a free man.","18238":"Oh dear... Is this really what they looked like? Honestly, I had no idea how tawdry and mundane this particular line of milliner fashions had become. At least, I suppose, I can look forward to punching my fist through the lot of them.","18239":"I don't deal in fine art. Too cutthroat for me - these days, at least. But I do know some art merchants that were almost certainly involved.","18240":"It was such a relief to have my paintings returned to me - thank you! Indeed, you may have arrived at the perfect time, as I think I've finished my portrait of Gasparov. Here!","18241":"What? What is this!? A crude and vulgar piece of amateur sketchwork!? But I had it on good authority that this Van Ruff was a real talent! Seems to me that he is nothing but an impostor on the art scene, with the hand and eye of a labourer! If you dare speak a word to anyone of this indignity, this travesty of a painting, so help me!","18297":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18298":"One of Jean La Fortune's band was captured, and Jean fears for her life if she reaches her destination.

We must free her!","18319":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18320":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18321":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18322":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18323":"We didn't get a winning roll this time. My brave men and women are stranded at sea after the skirmish, and they need to be rescued before the tide washes their lives away. I trust you with their lives, my friend!","18324":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18325":"I spit on those slave trader's graves! You know what happens to those they don't deem worth the hassle? They're thrown overboard like naught but heavy cargo! Get there in time, and they just might be saved.","18326":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18327":"La Corona is preparing to strike again. We need to be prepared. Please, take a picture of the armada they're gathering so we know what we're up against.","18328":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18329":"We are a proud nation. As such, we have written what we believe is the most socially advanced constitution of our time. I would gladly share the document with you, friend, if you'd consider following our lead.","18330":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18331":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18332":"§--18332--§","18333":"Bente would like you to build a zoo, to help the people of your city reconnect with nature.","18334":"Bente has so many artefacts, she can't have them all on display. She hopes you'll open a museum soon, so she can donate them to your collection.","18335":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18336":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18337":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18338":"I know why you haven't built a zoo; you're worried it would be cruel. I felt the same, until I realised my zoo could protect endangered species from extinction! Not to mention educating people of all walks of life about the joy of the wilderness!","18339":"Why don't you build a museum? I have so many fascinating artefacts I could give you if you did! It's terrible, really - the display cabinets are so stuffed, I'm forced to keep most of my collection in a dusty undercroft...","18340":"Bente wants your help in bringing some wild animals on her island into the safety of her zoo for the winter.","18341":"Bente would like you to collect some exotic animals she has first dibs on from Madame Kahina.","18342":"One of the inmates has broken out of the prison, taking several paintings with him. He claims to be the original artist, but Bleakworth's convinced that's a blatant lie, and he wants you to bring the criminal back.","18343":"I will not make a habit of interfering with nature, but I have heard the winter is likely to be particularly hard this year. As such, I'd prefer if the animals on my island were kept safe in the comfort of my zoo until the weather improves. Please say you're able to help?","18344":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18345":"Madame Kahina has recently imported some exotic animals, and I've decided I shall be the one to take care of them. They'll need a great deal of love, since they're all so far from home. Sadly, my ships are all on expeditions at the moment, so I wondered if you might collect them for me?","18346":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18347":"Sir Archibald has sent a new royal inspection to make sure that everything is looking good at Wormways Prison. As such, Bleakworth has asked you to clean up some smugglers that have been lurking around the island lately.","18348":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18349":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18350":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18351":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18352":"Here to collect Bente's animals? But you're three days early! They're still in their crates! If you want them now, you'll have to find them yourself.","18353":"Bente would like to gift you an extremely beautiful and loyal animal as a pet.","18354":"Bente has just returned from an eventful expedition - and since you're a close friend, she brought back a souvenir for you.","18355":"Bente would like to help you stave off any potential money problems with a small charitable donation.","18357":"In a fit of pique, Eli asked you to kill a murderer he had been forced to release. The Royal Council have somehow gotten wind of this, however, and Eli desperately needs you to destroy the evidence.","18358":"Sir Archibald sorrowfully informs you that the prisoner you escorted to be hanged was in fact innocent. He thinks it would be fitting if you, as executioner, were the one to offer his poor widow compensation.","18359":"Everyone needs love in their lives, and animals give it freely! Please, take care of this dear little cat. Since he's grown, I find I don't have quite so much time for him anymore. He is rather big these days, but I'm sure he'll make you very happy!","18360":"I'm back! I think that might just have been my best expedition yet. We would have been completely lost without the local guide, but instead we saw emerald forest weighed down with serpents; a funny sandy thingy where I sadly lost a few men; and in the end we found an enormous treasure! Here you go, you can have it.","18361":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18362":"A lack of material wealth should never hold us back from doing great deeds! I want to donate a small amount to help keep you on your feet. Sometimes when we run a little short on funds, we worry about relying too much on others. All I intend with this gift is to negate that sort of awkwardness in the future.","18363":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18364":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18365":"Escape and theft! I was keeping the paintings until we found out who he'd stolen them from. Damn vermin claimed he painted the artwork himself! Ridiculous. Bring him back so he can face the gallows.","18366":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18367":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18368":"A high society friend of his came to the rescue, so we had to release him. A murderer! As he left, he laughed at me, as if I were just one of the inmates. Well let's see who has the last laugh shall we?!","18369":"The Royal Council are sniffing around after you killed that prisoner. I can only assume you weren't discreet. Bury the evidence, or we'll both be going down.","18370":"This man is to be taken to his place of execution and hanged by the neck 'til dead. Too kind if you ask me, but apparently the verdict was contentious. You'd better prepare for trouble.","18371":"Heavens above, the man we just hanged was innocent! A disquieting judicial oversight... Since you were one of those involved, I think it'd only be right if you took the widow a purse of money to help soften the blow.","18372":"Who does Sir Archibald think he is, questioning my methods? A royal inspection is on the way - we have to guarantee this place is spotless! Wipe out those smuggler pests!","18373":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18374":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18375":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18376":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18377":"Somewhat surprisingly, Bente wants you to smuggle some eastern treasures out of High Clarence Hall and return them to their rightful dynastic owners via Princess Qing.","18378":"George sent Bente some animals that were mistreated, but it seems like something has happened to them en route.","18379":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18380":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18381":"Princess Qing tells me that some heirlooms belonging to her forefathers remain locked away at High Clarence Hall, and the Emperor has written to the Queen several times to ask for them back. I know it's naughty, but if you could somehow get them to the Princess, the world would be a better place for it.","18382":"Dear Mr. Smith always keeps an eye out for mistreated animals, and sends them to me by sea. Unfortunately, this time, they seem unusually late. Something must have happened... Do you also have George's compassion? Could you rescue them for me?","18383":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18384":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18385":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18386":"Bente's advisors think it's time for her to marry. They have a Mr. Bingle lined up, whom she's at least willing to meet. Sir Archibald would be the obvious person to bring them together at a garden party.","18387":"Bente needs a dress to wear to attend a garden party and meet her potential husband, Mr Bingle. Apparently, Madame Kahina has a nice selection for formal occasions.","18388":"It is with regret that Bente agrees, at the request of Sir Archibald and Mr. Bingle, to sever ties with Alonso Graves, with whom she is good friends. She asks if you could deliver him a letter and a parting gift.","18389":"Having received Bente's letter severing ties with him, Alonso would like to have a little tête-à-tête with Mr. Bingle. He asks you to arrange for them to meet.","18390":"In one final twist, Alonso would like you to photograph Mr. Bingle with the pigs in his pigsty. The image may encourage Bente to rethink any potential engagement, or indeed, any further association of any sort.","18391":"My advisors always remind me how indecent it is for a young, wealthy lady like me to remain single. They've found a perfect suitor in Mr Bingle, apparently - a man I know nothing about. I suppose I should at least meet him. Perhaps Sir Archibald might introduce us?","18392":"\"Mr . Bingle is a correct man who enjoys the hunt, and owns a textile business\". Is it awful to say he doesn't sound too much fun? Well, perhaps I shouldn't judge just yet. If I'm to meet him at Sir Archibald's garden party, I'll need some dresses from the Emporium Exotique.","18393":"I'm afraid you arrived just as Mr. Bingle left. He said nice things about my dresses, but not the company I keep. I am not to meet with Alonso any more, he says. *sobs*. But as Sir Archibald says, it's probably for my own good. Anyway, I must go, or I shall be late for the garden party...","18394":"I keep hearing about Mr. Bingle. It makes me excited to finally meet him! BRING HIM TO ME! Hehe. Ahh, poor Bente - all these people around her, telling her what to do. She's just like a bird in one of those cages, eh?","18395":"It's funny. Mr. Bingle confessed to me that he has no interest in Bente - only her pigs. See for yourself, he's rolling out there in the mud right now. I'm sure she'd love to see a photograph?","18396":"Our dear child is ready for marriage? And to Mr. Bingle of all people? Well, please do give her this letter: an invitation to our little garden party, at which said Mr. Bingle will also be present.","18397":"Meet Graves? Fine! If he wants to meet, w-w-why not? If he thinks this will scare me away from Miss Jorgensen, he's very much mistaken.","18398":"Oh, this photograph is horrid! Did you take it? I mean, I adore animals, but not like this! How can I forgive myself for almost breaking ties with Alonso? He's proven once again to be the only *very* close friend I have.","18399":"Bente thinks the young children the noble Beryl O'Mara rescued from the street deserve a little bit of pampering at the palace, and wants you to ask Sir Archibald if that would be OK.","18400":"Bente's proposal that Beryl's street children stay at High Clarence Hall for a short time has met with the royal seal of approval. It's up to you to ferry them there safely.","18401":"Bente is rather embarrassed to have to write a letter to Sir Archibald apologising for the behaviour of Beryl's street children at the palace. She wants you to deliver it.","18402":"Beryl seems to have done a wonderful job of teaching these street children good manners. I'm sure the Queen would be delighted to have them stay at the palace for a short time — it could help fulfil some of the promises to help the poor she's made as of late.","18403":"Sir Archibald didn't grimace too heavily as he announced the Queen had agreed to let the street children stay over at High Clarence Hall. Can you make sure they have a lovely, safe trip? I promised Beryl I'd take good care of them, you see.","18404":"I have written to Sir Archibald to apologise for the behaviour of the street children at the palace. Please, could you deliver my message? If Archie asks, tell him Beryl's agreed to pay any damages she can, though she did say that she isn't a woman of great family wealth. If the repairs are very expensive, it may be beyond her.","18405":"Oh Bente, you poor dear soul! Those children weren't merely a menace, they were a highly-organised gang of thieves! There's not a bit of silver cutlery left in all of High Clarence Hall!","18406":"§--18406--§","18407":"Find a game.

She wants you to find them, and revive the expedition with vital supplies. Perhaps you can also figure out what happened...","18418":"Having been found, Bente's expedition captain reaches out to you. Everyone aboard seems to be too stunned to remember what happened to them, and how they ended up being wrecked. Perhaps there are clues nearby...","18419":"Finally realising the sequence of events, the captain reluctantly agrees to lead you to the flotsam, so you can recover what he believes to be a cursed artefact.","18420":"Recovering the artefact does indeed seem to have cursed your ship, and you never found those missing crewmen... But Bente won't believe any of that, so you'd better bring her the mummy.","18421":"The mummy you gave Bente to put in her museum is seemingly responsible for an epidemic of disease in her city. Bente is understandably keen to obtain the emergency medical supplies Isabel Sarmento has on offer.","18422":"The expedition to the ruins of the sun worshippers should have been back weeks ago! I do remember they were worried about a mysterious curse... I wonder if you might find them and help them?","18423":"Ahoy! Our heartiest thanks for your help. The last we remember, we were aboard our ship, carrying the sarcophagus we found in the cave of the sun worshippers. Then everything went black... I wonder if there are any clues nearby? I'll bet it was the curse...","18424":"Ah, I remember it all now! As we left the sunlit reef, the whale seemed angry and lashed out with its tail. Our helmsman must have panicked, as that's when we were wrecked! But that doesn't explain what happened to the artefact - or where the missing crew of the little boat went...","18425":"I warned you about the curse! The artefact, it must be destroyed! Bente won't listen to an old sea dog like me - she'll put it on display, God forbid! For all our sakes, destroy it and end this blight!","18426":"Oh, dear me! No sooner was the mummy exhibit opened to the public than a wave of disease seemed to wash over my lovely, happy city! Miss Sarmento has promised to find me some emergency supplies - please, you must help!","18427":"Now I remember! It was our helmsman! He seemed on edge from the moment we departed the caves. No sooner had we left port than he steered us into a reef!","18428":"Some of the crew went out on a dive to recover our navigation equipment... But when we winched them back up, all we found were severed cables! It's the curse, I tells yer!","18429":"This monster! That explains the dreadful eerie noise we heard in the darkness, but it doesn't explain how we came to be wrecked here...","18430":"Game Settings","18431":"Current game settings may result in a poor game experience","18432":"Cultural Items","18433":"George is trying to encourage his friend, Artur Gasparov, to be more of a giving person. He's organised an auction to benefit those in poverty, and hopes Artur may be willing to donate a little something to the cause.","18434":"George has been recruiting nurses in your town for his newly-built hospital, and would like you to trolley them over to the waiting room.","18435":"George has asked you to escort some juvenile criminals to Eli for sentencing. He argues that poverty does not excuse a person from their moral obligations.","18436":"George Smith and Anne Harlow have a peace treaty, but one of Anne's crews disobeyed and attacked a peaceful convoy of George's ships. To honour the treaty, Anne has sent the guilty crew to George to be dealt with. He, however, has left the resolution to you.","18437":"George wants you to rescue some child labourers, and escort a schoolmaster recommended by Sir Archibald to George's island refuge, so that they get a chance in life to learn to read and write.","18438":"George wants you to take a picture of his workers outside their homes, believing he should not be ashamed to celebrate their happiness.","18439":"George hopes to see you make use of some liberal legislation in your cities. He believes enacting more liberal edicts can sway the Royal Council towards passing laws that more directly improve the lives of ordinary people in the future.","18440":"George would like to see you making more use of machines. As he may or may not have mentioned before, machination will be essential if people are to enjoy the new freedoms this century has brought them.","18441":"A curse? Oh, how silly! Well, I'm glad neither of us believe in all that nonsense. Really, it isn't very fair on all those ancient civilisations that we always assume their legacies are nothing more than traps and curses. I shall immediately place this wonderful artefact on display for all to see!","18442":"George is concerned that your people seem miserable, and suggests you do something about it in the name of progress.","18443":"George's worst fears came true when he began looking into the running of your mines. He urges you to reconsider your approach to working conditions, or risk further stirring his wrath.","18444":"George advises you learn the best way to prepare for unforeseen barren spells from the lessons set by ancient peoples, and establish a good fallback supply of food.","18445":"Thank you for saving my people! I don't know how I shall ever thank you. Curse or coincidence, I promise to be a little more careful in the future. The lives of the living are worth more than anything else. Please, take this vile mummy with you - I don't want to see it ever again!","18446":"Provides the latest news for residents, and charming souvenirs for visitors.","18447":"George has a dream of building a public library, and wants you to bring him the basic materials to do so.","18448":"George has his library - now he needs to start building his collection of books. He hopes you can snag him a couple of nice editions to get things going.","18450":"George has heard that some refugees have capsized! He'd like you to rescue them, and bring them to him so he can help them settle in.","18451":"Provides the latest news for residents, and charming souvenirs for visitors.","18452":"George has provided the refugees with somewhere to stay, and would like you to provide some sailcloth so that they can put their previous expertise in shipbuilding to use in their new surroundings.","18453":"George seems to be pondering his decision to aid Isabel Sarmento, a leader of a revolutionary movement in the New World. He's asked you to accompany a delivery to her, to ensure it arrives safely.","18454":"George wants you to distribute toys from Madame Kahina among the children of his city, believing there can never be too much love in the world.","18455":"George has heard, with regret, the news that slave traders still operate illegally in the New World. He asks only that you bring the perpetrators to justice.","18456":"George notices the slave operators you hunted down have survived, and suggests you take them to Isabel. With her guidance, and rigorous rehabilitation, there is at least a slim chance they can be turned from evil.","18457":"George has sent you to deliver a letter to Isabel Sarmento, without really explaining why it's so important to him. Perhaps the letter itself will offer some explanation.","18458":"Could you take this letter to Artur for me? I was hoping he might like to donate something for the charity auction I have planned. Artur is the kind who needs a good nudge before he'll think about anyone but himself, but I believe he'll come round to the idea in the end.","18459":"All the senseless wars around the globe have left us short of nurses, the lifeblood of the medical profession. I'm sure you don't mind, but I took the liberty of recruiting a new cohort from your town. Perhaps you could show them the way to my hospital?","18460":"Please escort these children to Eli, for they have committed an act of theft. Trust me, I know what it's like to be destitute; I've been helpless before. But you don't steal. If one man steals, the rest think they have the right to, and what kind of society is that?","18461":"This is the crew of rogues that disobeyed Anne Harlow, threatening the peace we worked so hard to put in place. Attacking a defenceless convoy like that... I'm too angry to know what to do with them, but I believe Anne meant to offer them up as a sacrifice, so that our peace might survive...","18462":"How can a human have agency, if they do not know what it is to be human? If as a child, they've lived a life without hope, without play, and without scholarship? I want you to bring these children together with the finest educators in a neutral setting, to give them the chance at an education they so desperately deserve.","18464":"When you compromise everything for an ideal, you want something to show for it in the end. If my workers express joy at associating with me, I've a right to be proud of that. I'd like you to photograph our small moment of happiness, so my great grandchildren will know the kind of man I tried to be.","18465":"A memorial to the glorious deeds of the year 1602.","18466":"Alonso wants champagne. He seems well aware of what a contradiction to his philosophy it is to need such an intensively cultivated product, but is willing to forgive himself in order to experience such a divine sensory pleasure.","18467":"Champagne is such a guilty pleasure. A real sin for a man like me, who's always so quick to reject anything that reeks of 'civilisation'. I'm sorry, but it's not my fault it tastes so wonderful! I just can't resist all those tiny bubbles tickling my tonsils!","18468":"Have you ever put a positive edict into place? We need more people willing to enter politics, and take a stand against the wealth of injustice in the Empire. The Queen is still young; her reign doesn't have to be remembered for how terrible it is right now.","18469":"Have I spoken to you about the importance of machines? I always forget. Anyway, the short story is - you ought to be using them if you want to give your people a chance to enjoy the free will they supposedly have...","18470":"A ruler is nothing without his people, and a people who are subjugated and living in fear are never on your side! All they are doing is simply waiting for the right moment to rise up against you. Just for once, can't you be nice to them?!","18471":"That could have been me in one of your mines, just as it was half a century ago. One in a long, weary line, squinting up at the sun, as if seeing it for the first time. My father died in a mine! I became a little deaf boy. I warn you, you'd better start looking after those miners, or there'll be hell to pay.","18472":"Alonso has given you the opportunity to use a pirate flag, meaning you can attack anyone you like and they likely won't know it was you, rendering any peace treaties you may have meaningless.","18473":"You should stock up every once in a while. You never know what twists and turns are around the corner in life. The Pharoahs of the delta used to plan for seven years of famine. Even if you saw the irrigation down there now, you'd still be saying those estimates were about right, believe me.","18474":"I want to build a public library. You know, in the old days, books were the most expensive thing imaginable, accessible only to the few. Times have changed, and books are cheaper now - but they're not cheap enough! I want them to be free; free for anyone to come and pick up as they please, to read whenever they please.","18475":"Now I need you to fill all those expectant shelves with books, beautiful books! Some people are afraid of knowledge; afraid of what will happen when ordinary people finally learn what's really going on. Don't let anybody stop you doing what's right!","18476":"Some refugees capsized at sea, and I want you to take them somewhere safe. My door is open to anyone - and I mean, anyone - but I won't stand there preaching to them, telling them it's all about hard work. I'd rather wait and see if they figure it out themselves.","18477":"Nobody likes being away from home, but those refugees are adapting pretty well. Turns out they're also pretty capable shipbuilders, too. Perhaps you can provide the sailcloth they need to get their new business off the ground?","18478":"I often wonder, is it acceptable to do bad things if the reasons are good? Or good things, if the reasons are bad? What makes one's reasons right? Well, anyway... I've decided to send something to Isabel. See that she gets it, will you.","18479":"Every so often, I like to spread a little joy among the city children. Madame Kahina has such wonderful toys, I've even been known to dabble myself! Never too old for play, never too old for love — and that's a word a slave barely knows, but for the little game of stones that used to bring us together.","18480":"I think I've told you some of my story, so I may as well continue. I have spent a much larger part of my life than anyone would like, wondering what it would be like to be free. That was the New World; a place where a struggle for freedom seemed to be taking place in every root and leaf of every tree around us. Somehow, that struggle for light is still going on.","18481":"I see you spared them. Well, I'm glad, but I don't want anything to do with them either. Take them to Isabel - she always finds a way to hold back the old anger, and lead people back to the righteous path.","18482":"It's rough being old. Every passing day, a step closer to the you-know-what. It's time I confronted some personal truths; things I never found the time to say... But no use mumbling it when it's right here in ink. Please, take this letter, and this straw doll to Isabel.","18483":"Here's a pirate flag for your ship. I know you long to kill anonymously and with impunity, so I'm just making the whole thing easier for you. Don't you see - nobody will know it was you! Hahahahaha. You're free! Hahahahaaha!","18484":"Alonso wants you to let go and stop worrying about which ships you destroy, and why. The important thing is that you are destroying them.","18485":"Maybe they're good people, maybe they're bad people. What does it matter? I know it's a difficult idea for you to swallow, but once they're dead, it really doesn't matter which side they were on.","18486":"Alonso would like you to take some of the younger generation on a boat trip through dangerous waters, believing that it'll do them good to know the truth about what they're up against.","18487":"Something of value to donate? Well, how about an evening with Gasparov? A candelit dinner (I mean what choice do we have!), my charming repartee, followed by a seemingly endless tour of my winter palace.","18488":"I'm not sure Mr. Smith is quite aware how much these young offenders are likely to suffer here... I'm afraid my institution isn't particularly modern, or enlightened. Still, if you insist...","18489":"Ha! I wondered where the little monsters had got to. Don't you worry - Beryl will keep them all wrapped up in cotton wool, and maybe I'll give 'em ten cents on the subject of morality while I'm there!","18490":"There comes a time in every young boy or girl's life that they must come to terms with the world in which they have been cruelly abandoned. To see first-hand the crimes committed in faraway lands in the righteous name of empire. Perhaps you can break the bad news?","18491":"So you'd deliver someone to prison, even if he did what he did for all the right reasons? The law is absolute? I'm sure you and Eli would get along well...","18492":"So, according to you, a crime is justified so long as it's committed for the right reasons? But where do you draw the line? Or are you an anarchist - a lunatic - who draws no line in the sand at all?","18493":"The usual from Mr. Smith? Please give him a message to say that we are grateful as ever for his generosity, and that his unwavering position of support for us is worth at least as much as anything he could send.","18494":"<br/>Isabel, dear child. You have grown so much since first I met you — the ferocious jaguar cub that you were. You had lost a brother, and I, a father. I still had the years on my side back then, and the bounce of a free man in my step. But I owe it to you to tell you, the price I paid for that freedom was a high one. I never found the courage to tell you before now, but as the ever-quickening spectre of death approaches, I believe it is time. <br/><br/> You always knew I had to be a runaway slave. Well, in order to escape the plantation, I had to kill a man. The one holding the whip. That man was your brother. I had to kill him to set us all free — a decision I have had to live with ever since, though I have to say, at the time I never saw it as a choice. I know I came to you soon after, bearing the gift he intended for you, your name and his on the label, and I told you the lie that he'd died fighting in the resistance. I said he'd fought bravely against La Corona. The truth is, he was just a kid who'd fallen into the slave trade like so many others. <br/><br/> Well, that's all I can really say. May you find it within yourself to forgive me for depriving you of your only brother. Either way, I shall continue to support you until I draw my last breath. <br/><br/>Yours, as ever, <br/><br/> Mr. George Smith.","18495":"Alonso would like you to deliver a small token of his affection to the latest woman he's become infatuated with.","18496":"Alonso has asked you to deliver a feast to his waiting guests, who are waiting to hear what happened to their countrymen.","18497":"Alonso is sending you around the houses to spread a message of fear, but insists it must be done quickly, or the whole thing will be a disappointment.","18498":"Alonso would like you to smuggle a surprise into Gasparov's city, as a reminder of the impermanence of our species' existence and legacy.","18499":"Alonso would like you to deliver some compensation to a woman in the area, whose husband appears to have met with injury whilst working at the factory.","18500":"I have discovered a woman of great bosom and beauty, one whose arching red soul bridges to mine across a chasm of leeching decay. I feel the need to tell her how I feel; to show her how my heart beats for her!","18501":"Hello, pigcrap. I would like you to offer up a dish of morsels and a few goblets of claret to some guests of mine. They were hoping to hear what unhappy fate has befallen their compatriots, and I feel obliged to let them know.","18502":"You always seem busy, pigcrap. So much to do, so little time! Well, I have something to keep you on your toes...","18503":"Perhaps you can remind Artur of a matter we once spoke about. I tried to explain the futility of 'legacy', you see. That all we are, all we create, will turn to dust. But for some reason, he seemed quite afraid at the idea. In my opinion, the man needs his head examined. Hahahahaha.","18504":"I owe someone an apology. I've been taking care of her husband for months now, you see - but yesterday, unfortunately, I was forced to let him go. I know you'll be there to remind her, however, that the news is only half-bad.","18506":"What!? This food ...WHAT IS THIS HORROR?! You mock us, boy! Prepare to meet thine end!","18507":"I need these delivered while they're still hot, you see. They'll remind my old friends that I am alive and well, just hiding under the bed, ready to RATTLE. Watch out, though - the people I took those from probably want them back...","18508":"From Graves? What could it... NO! William! Please no, not my William! What... inhuman monster would send only his torso?!","18510":"Our ships can sometimes end up very far away from home. It's always nice to find a good repair crane in a friendly harbour, if you don't mind building an extra one.","18511":"The Queen assigns the island share to you.","18512":"Storage full. Any surplus will be lost.","18513":"Pick up [Selection Picked Collectable GetGoodsAddedToStorage AT(0) Text]","18514":"Alonso would like you to take a picture of Bente's zoo for him to give to her as a gift, so that she knows he's there for her.","18515":"Alonso has set your harbour on fire so that you'll have some burning news to share in your morning papers. He wants you to be the first reporter on the scene, and to photograph the destruction.","18516":"Dear Bente loves her zoo. I often watch her through the bars; the way she floats among her gentle creatures, a sparkle of curiosity in her eyes. There must be some way to show her I am no different. I am a wild and savage beast that must be tamed!","18517":"Isn't it dreary when you open your newspaper in the morning, and there's no disturbing headline; no affirmation of all the chaos you know is bubbling under the surface? Well, good journalists always sniff out a story! Better hurry to your harbour, hahaha!","18518":"Alonso offers you one of his unwanted playthings to collect, which no longer gives him quite as much pleasure as it did at first.","18519":"At first it was a toy to give me thrills, but I soon got bored. Maybe I just don't have the patience? Still, you look as though you need cheering up - so come and get it!","18520":"Alonso Graves, a former soldier in the Imperial Army, has asked you to collect a secret weapon from him, which he plans to use on his former masters. He hopes it will serve to remind the Queen and her followers that they must live with the consequences of their wars overseas.","18521":"After the Great Purge, Alonso asks you to bring him some wood to help him light a church bonfire. He believes bathing in its light will help cleanse any feelings of ill will among his people, and to realise this difficult act was all for the greater good.","18522":"The Empire sent me to hell, and I came back... changed. I was stretched to within an inch of my life, saw lifelong friends roasted over fire like thanksgiving turkeys, and what for? What for?! I want them to feel as I felt. To feel their lungs fill with char, to witness their towers of Babel crumbling all around them.","18523":"Now we have purged the earth of wickedness, we must make a bonfire. Purify ourselves. This is not a petty vendetta. This is a realisation, for all mankind, that we are doomed, and I don't want that on my conscience.","18524":"Alonso asks you to decide which lion to feed a La Corona spy he has caught; Jean La Fortune or Isabel Sarmento. You get the feeling he wants you to intercede more generally in matters of morality, since he himself has no point of reference.","18525":"Alonso asks your advice once more in deciding which of his long-serving disciples finally deserves to be 'freed'. To be perfectly honest, the outlook seems rather bleak for both...","18526":"Alonso asks you to make another moral choice. Do you save a goodly priest, or a trio of convicts?","18527":"In this final episode of his moral meanderings, Alonso has sent a ship laden with disease to your harbour. He asks you to decide whether it's better to risk allowing it to fester, or to rashly blow it away with the dynamite he's provided. Better brace yourself either way...","18528":"In this final episode of his moral meanderings, Alonso has sent a ship laden with disease to your harbour. He asks you to decide whether it's better to risk allowing it to fester, or to rashly blow it away with the dynamite he's provided. Better brace yourself either way...","18529":"Alonso invites you to collect the legal fees he feels he owes you.","18530":"Barrage Duration","18531":"What is right, and what is wrong? Does anybody really know? Out here in the sticks, you lose all sense after a while. Anyway... I caught a La Corona spy, your honour. Should he dangle for Isabel, or for Jean?","18532":"Interesting interpretation... but I don't judge. Now, if I may beg your further counsel - two of my disciples wish to be free, after many fine years of service, but I'm afraid I can only save one of them. The decision is too painful for me, so I'd better leave it to you.","18533":"I know, I know. It's so hard living with the choices we make, isn't it? Say there was a wonderful, wonderful priest, and three wicked, terrible, bad prisoners drowning. If you had to choose, which would you bring me to be saved?","18535":"It's difficult, isn't it? Still, I think you made the right choice. The perfect fuel for those cruel winter nights you get in the old world!  Hahaha! One FINAL thing. When the black death descends, do you let it play out, or purge it with a great fire?","18536":"I've prepared a small gift, to thank you for your guidance in these difficult times. So much is going on inside my cranium, I sometimes think it might suddenly POP!","18537":"Away from me, fell spirits! No, not you — you can help me keep these tendrils of the netherworld from reaching over my threshold! Salt from Madame Kahina is what I need, so I can fashion a boundary they cannot cross!","18538":"Some cockroaches have crawled back from my past to try and blackmail me, threatening to reveal my previous deeds to my customers. Imagine being that naive. Send them a message for me, please: Madame Kahina cannot be intimidated.","18539":"Some people Kahina used to know are trying to extort money from her, waving the occupations she chose in the past at her reputation. A foolish mistake; they signed their sentence the moment the letter was delivered.","18540":"I've heard wonders about everything that sails out of your shipyards. I'd like to commission you to build a cargo ship to join my trade fleet. And maybe more in future, if you meet my expectations.","18541":"Madame Kahina always aims for excellence. It has come to her attention that yours are the finest ships in the region, and she'd like to put one of your cargo ships to the test. If it meets her expectations, she might request even more ships in future.","18542":"Madame Kahina has seen something special in you, and believes you may be able to carry out something slightly different to the sort of job she usually entrusts you with. She wants you to go to a ship, unseen, and bring back everything you find there, without asking any questions.","18544":"You passed Madame Kahina's test, and now she's ready to trust you with a real mission. You must follow her guest, and report everything you hear back to her.","18545":"You still don't know who that prisoner is to Madame Kahina, but she wants him free. Breaking a man out of Wormways Prison, however, is easier said than done. Expect heavy surveillance, and a strong response once he's found to be missing.","18546":"Madame Kahina's explanations have been interrupted by an unforeseen fleet. You still don't fully understand why, but their attack must be stopped.","18547":"Loyal, reliable, efficient... and you don't ask many questions. It may be time to trust you with a different kind of task. I will give the coordinates of a ship. Be a shadow, get there unseen, and bring me what you find.","18548":"Good. My agents didn't even catch a whiff of you. Now, it's time for the real challenge. I'm meeting someone today. Follow them back, and make sure you stay every bit as invisible as you've been up until now.","18549":"So, this is where they've been keeping him... I must admit, you do seem to have a talent for discretion. I'll warn you now, though - this next task is the most difficult one I'll ask of you. You'll get your answers to your questions - once our brother is free and alive by your side.","18550":"You have succeeded like few before you. Very well - I owe you the truth. I've long since left those days behind me, but I am still a proud member of my organisation. We work to restore the balance between chaos and order. But they- they know we have Jacob! Defeat them!","18599":"I told you, this 'associate' of yours is still safely stored behind bars! And I will not tolerate any more disconformities towards my management!","18600":"Your help has been invaluable. You may not yet realise it yet, but you've been key in restoring an ancient harmony of power and control. I will not endanger your life any more, but remember: nothing is true.","18601":"Margaret Hunt will be hosting her yearly masked ball soon. According to her, becoming one of her suppliers is in your best interest.","18602":"Margaret Hunt has set her mind on building the finest symbol of God in the Old World. For that, she'll be needing a whole lot of gold and pearls.","18603":"My yearly masquerade is the most anticipated event among the high-society. It's so curious how people are only their true selves once they're behind a mask... Anyhow - there will be plenty of beverages and titbits required, and I believe it will do you good to be one of my suppliers.","18604":"Only a fool would dismiss the value of religion. Herds of people follow every sacred word blindly... And so do I, of course! I have endeavoured to craft the most captivating symbol of God in the Old World - and only the finest materials will do, my child.","18605":"Oh, what heartless rumours to spread about a grieving widow, and a most trusted member of Her Majesty's council. It would be but a favour to the world to strip them of their hearts completely.","18606":"You of all people must understand how difficult family matters can be. Even when decades apart, one cannot help but worry about the well-being of their kin. My poor niece will grow tired of playing pirates eventually. In the meantime, I'll slit the throat of anyone who dares leave a mark on her noble skin.","18607":"A band of shameless criminals has stolen one of Her Majesty's vessels! You must be swift, child - who knows what mischief they could cause under the royal flag!","18608":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18609":"§--18609--§","18610":"Someone is spreading nasty rumours about poor old Lady Margaret. She would be most grateful if someone were able to silence them.","18611":"Lady Margaret and her niece, Anne Harlow, carried their grief in very different ways. While Lady Hunt herself cannot take action as a member of the Royal Council, she still wants Anne to be protected from every harm.","18612":"Lady Margaret Hunt has alerted you to a ship that was stolen from the Queen. They must be stopped, and fast, for they could fool anyone into believing they actually work for the Crown!","18613":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18615":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18616":"Lady Margaret Hunt has asked if you could provide escort for her ship, which is carrying a substantial donation for the poverty-striken children of the New World. Prevention is better than a cure, since they've been robbed in the past.","18617":"Lady Margaret would like you to escort one of her guests back home, before his unabashed drinking gets him in trouble.","18618":"Lady Margaret organised a snake exhibition in loving memory of her late husband, Gilbard Hunt. Now that the exhibition is over, the animals must be safely returned to their original habitat, the rainforests of the New World.","18619":"As usual, I will soon be shipping my monthly donation to the New World. Unfortunately, we're going to have need of an escort, since we've had a few... troubles in the past. Hard to imagine what cold-blooded creatures would have the stomach to steal food and clothes meant for less fortunate children...","18620":"My dear guest got a bit too infatuated with the sparkling wine during our celebration in honour of our beloved Baron Vismark. Take him away discreetly, before he embarrasses himself any further, dear.","18621":"I organised an exhibition in honour of my late husband, Gilbard Hunt - may the Lord rest his soul. He was very fond of snakes, and had a great interest in the venomous species found in the New World rainforests. Now that the exhibition is over, they should be returned to their original habitat unharmed.","18622":"Come back here, you murderer! I will avenge Lord Vismark even if it costs me my life!","18623":"Margaret Hunt has instructed you to follow a suspicious ship that's been roaming around the region on behalf of the Queen, and report back everything you learn.","18624":"The Royal Council has been informed of a suspicious ship sailing in Her Majesty's waters. As a loyal servant of the Queen, I assume you will have no trouble in following them, and reporting everything you learn about this strange alien.","18626":"Lady Margaret loves the royal residence at High Clarence Hall, aesthetically speaking. She's commissioned you to take a detailed picture of the place, for ornamental purposes.","18627":"Isn't the royal residence at High Clarence Hall a building of the utmost beauty? It exudes tranquility. I would love to have a framed picture of it on my wall. As it happens, I hear you have a special talent for photography. Would you mind, dear?","18628":"Lady Margaret knows that, in order to make things go as one plans, one must sometimes make concessions. This time, she knows Alonso Graves is a ticking time bomb, who must be appeased before he explodes.","18629":"An unknown party has recently docked at Madame Kahina's Harbour. Margaret Hunt wants to know who they are, and more importantly, whose side they're on.","18630":"It's fair to say your relationship with Margaret Hunt could be better. She'd certainly like to have a cordial relationship with you again, though - which is why she's tasked you with a simple delivery, to lay the foundations for a new partnership.","18631":"Lady Margaret still cares about her niece, Anne. She asks if you could take Anne a present from her, to remind her that she'll always be welcome at her house.","18632":"Lady Margaret is devastated about Sir Archibald's decision to question the good work of her organisation, The Promise Trust. She has written letters of appeal to her fellow council members, to hopefully make them reconsider their decisions in her favour.","18634":"Ensuring the peace in the realm sometimes requires some distasteful actions - such as getting involved with nasty characters like Mr. Graves. Please, deliver this gift to his harbour on behalf of Her Majesty.","18635":"How can one make a move without knowing what colour the pieces are on the board? An unknown ship has recently docked at Madame Kahina's harbour. Bring me all the information you can gather about them.","18636":"I know we've had our differences in the past, child, but I still believe we can work together if we cast aside our differences. What do you say? Would you do a simple delivery for an old lady?","18637":"I still pray for the day my niece gives up the buffoonery of piracy and comes back to me. Please, take her a gift from her aunt, and let her know my door is always open for her return.","18638":"It breaks my feeble heart that Sir Archibald could ever doubt the good work we do at The Promise Trust. Deliver these letters of appeal to my fellow members of the council. Hopefully, they will understand.","18639":"§--18639--§","18640":"Lady Margaret Hunt has come to respect you - something few people can truly say. She has a gift for you, to show she likes having you on her side, along with an apology.","18641":"I must admit, I think I underestimated you at first, child. You have potential; I'd say you could even become a suitable leader if you keep the right people around you. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation. I hope you accept my apologies.","18642":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18643":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18644":"(TBC - Quest not yet written)","18645":"Lady Margaret Hunt wants to cook a special recipe for a party that's being held by the Royal Council. She hopes you can provide her with the ingredients.","18646":"Although Lady Margaret will not be able to attend, she still wants you to make sure Sir Archibald receives it in time for the event.","18647":"There is an event for the Royal Council approaching, and I've heard of a wonderful recipe that could spice the beverages up quite nicely. Bring me these ingredients, child.","18648":"Ohh, my old joints are giving me trouble again... Unfortunately, it seems I won't be able to attend the party. Still, do make sure Sir Archibald receives my special champagne - I poured all my love into it.","18649":"Lady Margaret's shipment of beer was contaminated, and she's worried the lives of her people will be in danger if the brew reaches them.","18650":"Lady Margaret is happy you managed to destroy the contaminated beer before it reached her crew - but they still need their brew, if you could deliver it to them.","18651":"Behold, before your very eyes, a disappearance of a magnitude never before seen! A whole ship VANISHES!","18652":"I have just received the most dreadful news! A shipment of beer that was supposed to quench the thirst of my loyal crew has been contaminated! You need to get rid of the deadly brew, before it reaches them!","18653":"I am so relieved that they're safe. But they still need to wet their throats. Deliver this new shipment of beer to them.","18654":"Margaret Hunt's Promise Trust are ready to make a big announcement: they are close to discovering a cure for flu! Many distinguished guests are getting ready to attend, and Lady Margaret has asked you to escort them.","18655":"After their successful announcement, The Promise Trust are ready to start looking for their first test subjects. Lady Margaret has prepared leaflets to spread around the region, in the hope of recruiting as many people as possible.","18656":"The leaflets were a success! Countless people signed up in the hope of becoming the first to be healed from the terrible sickness. They need to be escorted to Lady Margaret's harbour in order to proceed.","18657":"Only a few more things are required for the research to continue. The Promise Trust's main researcher has arrived at Madame Kahina's harbour - he needs to be taken to Lady Margaret, along with a few last minute materials.","18658":"Everything is ready for the big announcement. The Promise Trust are ready to publish the results of our long-running research on the flu. I presume you'll take good care of our distinguished guests.","18659":"The announcement was a complete success! We are so close to finding a cure for the flu. All we need now are a few test subjects that would be kind enough to entrust their lives to us. Would you spread the word around?","18660":"Marvelous! We've received an overwhelming response. There are many people ready to sail our way - please, make sure they arrive safely.","18661":"The Promise Trust's main researcher has just arrived at Madame Kahina's harbour. Will you pick him up for me? We'll also be needing a few more materials to finish this phase - I'm sure you'll have no trouble in gathering it?","18662":"Carl has become acquainted with a very nice old lady, who just so happens to be extremely rich. With no husband or children to take care of her, Carl has offered to step in and help. He'd like you to organise a gift of coffee, so he can keep her company in the afternoons.","18663":"Carl is running out of patience looking for gold in the New World, and would like you to deliver some dynamite to him to speed up the process.","18664":"Carl has heard one of his vessels has been wrecked at sea. Blaming it on the sailors, he asks that you ignore any survivors and just recover what's left of the cargo.","18665":"Carl has noticed that his shoreline looks a little dirty, and would like your help in a beachcombing effort to clean the place up.","18666":"Carl has concocted an insurance fraud, which requires you to destroy two of his empty ships and keep some sort of evidence of the accident. He then intends to submit a claim for both ships, as if they were fully laden with goods...","18667":"Carl has lost a ship in imperial waters, and seems to think this makes the accident the fault of the Queen. He wants you to gather what remains of the ship to support his legal case against the crown.","18668":"Carl's police have identified the instigators of a recent riot in his settlement, and he wants you to escort them through the angry crowd to jail.","18669":"Carl thinks he's found a machine that will greatly increase the profits from his factories, but he's afraid others may want to steal the secret designs - unless you can protect them.","18670":"Carl is astonished at your shortage of banks. He wants you to build more - not just for your sake, but for the sake of the economy!","18671":"Carl is disgusted to hear that the Royal Council intends to pass a law that reduces working hours, and wants you to secretly replace the proposed edict with an idea of his own.","18672":"Carl is looking for an island in the New World with gold on it, and would like you to take a photograph if you find one.","18674":"La Corona strangles our supply routes and burns our fields. We have more people than we can feed. If you have anything - anything you can spare - you would be saving many lives if you could send it to us.","18675":"This revolution is, sadly, a violent one. We are always in need of more weapons. Help us arm our brothers and sisters against La Corona.","18676":"Isabel is worried about not having enough supplies to feed all the refugees they've sheltered. She would appreciate your help immensely.","18677":"The Movement's resistance is always in need of more weapons. Donate any spares to them, and Isabel Sarmento will be eternally grateful.","18678":"Isabel Sarmento wakes up every day to a new, difficult situation. A group of civilians have escaped La Corona on board a small ship, but they need your help if they're to arrive at El Puerto safe and sound.","18679":"It's dawned on Carl that his letter of proposal to Bente Jorgensen may never have arrived, and he urges you to deliver a replacement.","18680":"Every day, I receive new pleas for help from people who want to escape the yoke of La Corona. We have word of a group of civilians who managed to escape on board a small ship, but they need protection to bypass La Corona's surveillance. Will you help us?","18681":"Not content to read between the lines of Bente's letter, Carl assumes she's playing hard-to-get.","18682":"Not to be denied, Carl decides to make a second dress to woo Bente, this time like the sky at night as she described.","18683":"Desperate to be rid of Carl Von Malching's greasy advances, Bente asks you to deliver a letter to Carl. In it, she tells Carl she will marry him, but only on the condition that he renounces his family name, and any claims to any titles he may have.","18684":"The poor people that live under La Corona don't even know of our existence. We need to let every single one of them know that they have an alternative; that we are here to liberate them. Please, cover our Movement in your newspaper - we never know who might be reading.","18685":"Carl has managed to pass a local bylaw that lets labourers work from a younger age, and recommends you do the same.","18686":"The Movement's resistance is also a war on information. It's crucial for the good people living under colonial oppression to know who the Movement are, and what they can do. Isabel has asked you to showcase her island in your newspaper, in order to spread the word.","18687":"In order to assess your worth, Carl wants to know if you can sustain a healthy balance in your business ventures - or if you really are as incompetent with money as he always thought.","18688":"Due no doubt to some insider tip-off, Carl believes the price of cigars is about to go through the roof, and wants to get his ships to Madame Kahina's unhindered so that he can buy up all her stock.","18689":"Carl bought his cigars from Kahina, thanks to the escort you provided, and now he thinks it's time to sell. He wants you to do it for him, though one can't help but think there's something funny going on.","18690":"Carl's cigars turned out to be imitations made of wax. Understandably, his clients are not too happy about it.","18691":"The Queen and Sir Archibald appear to be ignoring Carl's claims to the title of Baron. He asks you, as a fellow person of standing, to make the case to Archie on his behalf, along with a pleading letter.","18692":"Carl confesses that the documents Sir Archibald needs in order to verify his claim to a barony are still lost in the nearby mountains, where his first wife had her carriage... accident. He wants to avoid going up there himself.","18693":"Sir Archibald seems satisfied with the basic evidence of Carl's claim to a barony. However, he wants proof Carl will come to the aid of the Queen in her hour of need.","18694":"Upon hearing that all he needs in order to claim his barony is for his old family castle to be restored, Carl asks you to fetch some materials so he can start building right away.","18695":"Realising he can't afford to restore the family castle, Carl asks you to photograph something else instead, and take it to Archie pretending it's just part of the refurbishment.","18696":"Sir Archibald is finally ready to admit that Carl can have his barony. All that remains is for you to escort Von Malching to the ceremony.","18697":"Commuter Movement","18698":"I've met an older lady I absolutely adore! If I had some coffee, we could spend the afternoons together discussing her great wealth, and also, perhaps, the apparent lack of an heir to it...","18699":"I haven't found anywhere near as much gold out in the New World as I'd anticipated! There must be something you can bring me to speed up the process of destruction and deforestation?","18700":"What do you have against banks? After a while, it's the only thing worth building if the divide between rich and poor is to reliably grow!","18701":"The Royal Council is about to pass a law that allows workers to take days off! Just when I thought they couldn't get any lazier... I want you to go there in secret, and replace it with my own, much more sensible legislation...","18702":"Imagine how much gold must be out there in the New World - oh, I can just hear it gleam! If you do happen to see an island with an aura of the auric, do take a picture of it for me...","18703":"Alas! The child, no more than ⁬eight, and wasted by fever struggles weakly against the wind, as another grueling day at the mill begins... Sound like excellent business? Then here - exercise this edict, and never suffer seeing a child idle again!","18704":"What kind of competition are you? If your financial accounts are anything to go by, I'd say 'measly'. Or perhaps you can show me I've underestimated you...?","18705":"Commuter Balance","18706":"The only possibility is that my offer of marriage never arrived, else I would already have received Miss Jorgensen's effusive letter of acceptance! Promise you'll be more reliable than the last nitwit postman...","18707":"Oh, I see! It's clear from her letter that she's just being coy. I shall woo her with a gift that oozes opulence... A dress fashioned from sun-glist threads, and gold. Huhuhuhuhuh.","18708":"She, too, must enjoy the thrill of the chase! If she wants a dress as glittering as the milky way, then that is what she shall get!","18709":"I cannot deny this is a beautiful dress, but... I never imagined he'd have it made. Oh, please help me! I cannot marry him, I will not marry him! But wait... an idea occurs to me... I shall write to accept his proposal of marriage, on condition he renounces his name and titles!","18710":"As I'm sure you know, I am a master of the markets - and I sense the price of cigars is set to skyrocket! Quickly, get me to Madame Kahina's post haste, so I can buy everything she has!","18711":"Good, good... Now it's time to sell these sought-after cigars. Perhaps I could leave the actual selling to you? Though I recommend you don't let them see the actual merchandise before you've made your getaway...","18712":"Why is this box so light? Wait a minute... they're all fake! Don't think you can trick us and live to tell the tale!","18713":"I have waited long enough! My polite requests to restore my barony to me seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Take this letter to Blake, and use all your puny powers of influence to force their hand!","18714":"I knew that stuffed bird would want proof. Well, the truth is the family scrolls fell down the mountainside during the... accident. *Carl erupts in melodrama* Oh, woe is me! Forsooth, I cannot return to that cursed place, lest I discover my lost love roaming those hills. They say she still shrieks my name, as was always her terrible habit.","18715":"Sir Archibald was forced to admit that my family lineage suggests I am due a barony. But now he's muttering something about defending the Queen should the need arise. Sounds like a job for you, not me...","18716":"They keep finding ways to dodge my perfectly legitimate requests, don't they? Well, if it's a castle they want, a castle they shall have. While I work out how to restore my family castle to be even grander than the royal palace, you go fetch me some materials!","18717":"I... I can't rebuild the family castle! It's far too expensive! And the maintenance costs I'll incur later on... Hold on, I have an idea! I'll take a clipping of a palace from this cheap novelette. Take this, and pretend it's part of the new renovation! They'll never know!","18718":"So this is Von Malching's family castle? It certainly looks different to my memory of it. I gather he opted for a more modern design, which shows commendable practicality. Well, I see I have no choice but to give the man what he wants. You'd better bring him here...","18719":"I can't just keep putting that odious man's leery letters in the fire... He may eventually come rapping at my door in person *shudders*.

The moment she sees it, she will wilt into my waiting arms.","18721":"Some may find that pretty... but perhaps it may surprise you to learn that I prefer a dress dark and laced with mystery, like the sky at night.","18722":"I cannot deny this is a beautiful dress, but... I never imagined he'd have it made. Oh, please help me! I cannot marry him, I will not marry him! But wait... an idea occurs to me... I shall write to accept his proposal of marriage, on condition he renounces his name and titles!","18723":"Renounce my rightful claim to barony? Further disgrace my family name!? The girl is mad as a box of frogs! She's madder than my last wife, and we all know what had to happen to her... Sorry, I mean, what accidentally happened to her.","18724":"I do sympathise with Carl, but I'm afraid covering yourself in feathers doesn't make you a cockerel. The only chance he has of succeeding in this matter is if he can provide formal evidence to support his rather audacious claim.","18725":"Did Mister Von Malching really defeat those enemies of the Empire singled-handedly? I must say, it all seems rather suspicious, you coming to me in his stead each time. Still, I may have neglected to mention, but he could never be a baron without a castle anyway...","18726":"Hahahahaha! They have no idea how little, and yet how much I deserve this... Finally, I'll be Baron Von Malching at last! I do hope you'll keep all the juicy details of how it came about a secret...","18727":"As you may know, I have a good eye for treasure, and I've spotted some more at sea! 'Cept I won't go and get it myself, after what happened last time... Maybe you could go instead?

Formerly a champion of a student union of dentists, Mercier was asked by the Queen to use his popular appeal to pacify increasing threats of revolution in her territories. Instead, Mercier sided with the protesters, declaring the people's complete independence from crown authority.","109692":"You work for something greater now; it's the ultimate blessing I can bestow.","109693":"Do this your own way— no— no really! Perceive it in whatever way you wish!","109694":"A great wave is coming— let it carry you to your dreams.","109695":"Now's your moment! Action must be taken! Rise! Rise!","109696":"I can give you the dental key, but you must reach into the mouth and twist.","109697":"The smallest inkling of success is still your inkling of success!","109698":"You must be champing at the bit!","109699":"Go, be impulsive!","109700":"You've done well. Go now, footloose and fancy-free.","109701":"Your autonomy is admirable.","109702":"You are a doer. Anarchists are doers!","109703":"A peaceful smile at the end is worth the momentary discomfort.","109704":"The people love those who make themselves indispensible.","109705":"Instead of dismantling the status quo, you perpetuate it!","109706":"The chicanery of a career politician.","109707":"Gums bleed, but quickly heal.","109708":"Never lose heart. Never.","109709":"And yet the determination comes easily to so many of us!","109710":"Always try to get at the root of a problem.","109711":"Success can come in a twinkling of the eye.","109712":"I find the suspense terrible. Long may it last.","109713":"The more you do, the more you can do!","109714":"Keep pushing, never let yourself be pushed back.","109715":"Your actions urge a final reckoning ever closer, do not relent!","109716":"There is no right or left, only the liberty of choice!","109717":"It is not the banner under which you stand, but your equity of spirit.","109719":"Your submission carries more weight than any academic paper.","109720":"Have you acted on behalf of the people?","109721":"Your contribution is made?","109722":"I-I admire your spontaneity, but the occasion is inopportune.","109723":"I don't enjoy turning away committed activists such as yourself.","109724":"Your single-mindedness deserves better reward.","109728":"If you think neighbouring an anarchist will be chaos, you deceive yourself. Anarchy is order!","109729":"I challenge you to oversee your own transformation. Don't wait for your people to make it for you!","109730":"I expect you think you know what anarchy is? Expect to have all those misconceptions overturned!","109731":"When it's this sweet, you have to worry about toothrot.","109732":"Nothing is more certain than the uncertain!","109733":"A defining moment, for all of us.","109734":"The wind has switched!","109735":"This is it, this is change!","109736":"…and just like that, a thousand poorhouse faces lift.","109737":"Joy unbridled!","109738":"You are an original.","109739":"Brave ideas survive through brave individuals like you.","109740":"You are a mover and shaker.","109741":"There's a stool for you at the table of the free.","109742":"How do you feel, to be a salmon leaping upriver?","109743":"You fly against the grain!","109744":"You are reinventing society!","109745":"The world must change or be changed!","109746":"I will never give up on the people.","109747":"The injustice!","109748":"They call it civilisation. It's laughable.","109749":"Hard to control feelings in times like this.","109750":"Reduced to serfs in the mud.","109751":"Pulling teeth is grisly work.","109752":"Well, enjoy the cage you have built for yourself.","109753":"You think it's free will, but you're a pawn.","109754":"They feed you lies like a duck seed, and you've never quacked.","109755":"You'll make yourself a target.","109756":"Perhaps you don't realise what's at stake here!","109757":"Have you never asked questions? Who doesn't ask questions?","109758":"You only exist, you're not alive.","109759":"I am Dr. Mercier. Beg pardon, but since I have a foot in your door, you should listen; anarchy is the only way!","109760":"Dr. Hugo Mercier; shining the lamp that is anarchy into the dark, plaque-ridden crevices of state.","109761":"Take a pamphlet— free as the wind, as we all are!","109762":"Come in, relax, open wide!","109763":"Paradise is all around you, but you really have to look to see it.","109764":"Welcome to our humble commune.","109765":"The island that upset the apple cart.","109766":"Voice your hate against the state here, without fear of recrimination!","109767":"This is the crossroads, from which a million starry paths surge in every direction!","109768":"I demand so much of them, and yet, if it can free them from their chains…","109769":"United by suffering; black, white, rich, poor. Our congregation lives and dies together.","109770":"Unfettered from possessions, they listen only to their hearts...and my broadcasts.","109771":"Women, men…children. Happy.","109772":"They are free now, to sail wherever they wish!","109773":"No hierarchies aboard my ships. Every man worthy as the next!","109774":"Like an ocean that collapses petty structures, the people are in heavy swell!","109775":"Do you not see? The waves rule themselves!","109776":"The people's profound thanks.","109777":"As promised, the masses are provided for!","109778":"Give and thou shalt receive.","109779":"Why not, whyever not!","109780":"By all means, by all means!","109781":"In the interest of the people, I accept.","109782":"My privilege to say no. My right.","109783":"Only a sheep would baa and nod.","109784":"As I said to the Queen— no!","109785":"Why should anarchists all have unruly beards? I shave in solidarity with the workers whose contract obliges it of them! Besides...dentists despise beards.","109786":"I shepherd no sheep! But stand with them before the fence, ready to leap to liberty!","109787":"The mouth is a special instrument. In dentistry you see many who cannot play— any tune, let alone one of their own.","109788":"Only when he came to me with chronic toothache, did the college Dean recognise the impact of dentistry, and reluctantly, offer me a chair.","109789":"Among the first to be certified a dentist, among the first to label myself \"anarchist\". Everyday a new first.","109790":"Vicente is the vilest of tyrants. But the people of the new world are taking back everything that was never his, as I have from the Crown.","109791":"How can George pretend not to hear me when I have a megaphone? Beware! Not all libertarians have open minds!","109792":"Alonso is wild! Absolutely wild. His thirst for violence seems almost unquenchable!","109793":"Lady Hunt tells me, despite being an enemy of the people, that she had been expecting someone like me to hasten the day of judgement.","109794":"I, like Bente, am an optimist. To spread absolute love and freedom is the most constructive thing a human can do.","109795":"I straightened Beryl's jaw, now I expect she wants to straighten mine because I threaten to eradicate poverty forever— thereby destroying her entire premise!","109796":"Wibblesock, crushed with guilt because he took the money of some undeserving legatee, can you imagine?! I say take that money William! Use it!","109797":"Von Malching's greed is not impulsive, but compulsive. The difference is night and day!","109798":"Strip Gasparov's veneer, and there's nothing! Here is a man who pays to have his books riffled, so that his grand library appears well-used!","109799":"Jean is one of the finest I know. Using all at his disposal to protect his vision, even if it means contradiction.","109800":"The plight of that maladjusted and grief-stricken Harlow girl, only excites my desire to prevail against the ruthless machinery of state!","109801":"Individualists such as Old Nate can always be reminded of the importance of community…","109802":"The Queen chose me, of all people, to mediate with the rioters. I mediated heavily in their favour.","109803":"Art is truth. Gasparov is a lie.","109804":"Bleakworth has built a cage around himself. A mercy for the rest of us, he can't see beyond its walls.","109805":"Princess Qing is itching to betray her Imperialist heritage, I can sense it.","109806":"The Queen wanted me for her puppet. But I snipped her strings and gave them to the people!","109807":"George the \"philosopher king\" is a liberal sickeningly comfortable in his inertia.","109808":"No-one need go cold or hungry.","109809":"I can fulfil my covenant with the people, now.","109810":"For the common wealth.","109811":"Exclude no-one.","109812":"We never need to import anything, of course.","109813":"Do not let material things define you!","109814":"You must understand, I can't promise further trade.","109815":"If professors only traded ideas as freely as we do...but they only trade in favours.","109816":"Despite our trade, no hierarchy of property develops here, merely rigourous economic planning.","109817":"What I like about trading with you, is I know you do it for your people, not just to feed ambition.","109818":"I know what will be good for you...","109819":"Who knows where this will lead!","109820":"Be spontaneous!","109821":"Be instinctive!","109822":"Act now, think later!","109823":"Demand the impossible!","109824":"A little anaesthetic?","109825":"I've unstoppered the laughing gas.","109826":"Freedom has to be taken!","109827":"The people will not cease until they have abolished you!","109828":"Propaganda by the deed!","109829":"Anarchy is anything you want it to be.","109830":"Risk nothing, and you risk everything.","109831":"Your passion gives me faith.","109832":"Damned if I do, damned if I don't.","109833":"You think being an anarchist means I'll always disagree?","109834":"The people trust me to know what's best.","109835":"No decision is taken without the people's approval.","109836":"I make up my own rules.","109837":"Don't reduce our bond to a transaction.","109838":"Look beyond straight lines!","109839":"Too slow! Galaxies have shifted!","109840":"Stagnation! The tactics of the establishment!","109841":"Save your filibuster for the royal council!","109842":"I will not be left to vegetate here!","109843":"You are not in this wholeheartedly.","109844":"Everything I demand of you, I demand of myself sixfold.","109845":"Why not take it even further!","109846":"I was thinking of something more radical!","109847":"Even when we yield, we are unyielding.","109848":"I'll not tarnish my good name with violence.","109849":"I believe in revolution, not reaction.","109850":"Throw your bomb if you have the mettle, throw!","109851":"Dentists never flinch.","109852":"Then you'll just have to kill the people where they stand.","109853":"Anarchy, like dentistry, is an exact science.","109854":"For mutual fulfilment.","109855":"I don't try to lead, I try to be a guide.","109856":"Anarchy is fairness.","109857":"Kindness is universal.","109858":"Once they take hold, ideas become unstoppable.","109859":"Not political constraints. Moral constraints.","109860":"I am agitated, and so are my many friends.","109861":"You have no authority. No authority!","109862":"A reaction to sustained repression!","109863":"A dentist has to use his drill.","109864":"Your destruction is my creation!","109865":"Justice is the living god!","109866":"We are both truth-seekers.","109867":"I can promise you immunity.","109868":"War and peace, and in between.","109869":"You're giving anarchy a bad name.","109870":"A cross-pollination of our economic principles.","109871":"Fancy forming an adhocracy?","109872":"We are masters of our own happiness, but we can't do it alone.","109873":"I can't be seen to be consuming imports.","109874":"I need the people to help themselves for a while.","109875":"Economics is too important to be left to the traders.","109876":"Join the free, live as you please!","109877":"Not all bonds are bad. Anarchy can also be family.","109878":"I can only trust myself to do what's right for the people.","109879":"I have no concerns burning my bridges.","109880":"Take it. Property is theft, and I practice what I preach.","109881":"I would give it all away in a moment.","109882":"The farms have produced so much, I can afford to give some away.","109883":"Solidarity.","109884":"Amen.","109885":"Anarchists enjoy surprises.","109886":"Res Publica","109887":"An altruist at heart.","109888":"Power corrupts!","109889":"Perhaps you should rinse out your mouth!","109890":"Pah! Dogma!","109891":"Beware the ides of March","109892":"Lois scelerates","109893":"Tyrants always seek to injure the eloquent.","109894":"And make us all martyrs? So be it!","109895":"Everyone is ready to sacrifice themselves for anarchy!","109896":"You and I pursue something beyond ourselves.","109897":"You cannot vanquish an idea.","109898":"Anarchists are thinkers, not fighters.","109899":"Nothing in the universe is irreversible.","109900":"An agreement of the people.","109901":"We enter into mutual contract.","109902":"It is a thing both dangerous and adventurous you do!","109903":"I respect your desire for autonomy.","109904":"Anarchy means different things to different people.","109905":"The Queen took the people's rights, so I took her people.","109906":"Like family, but better.","109907":"I hereby condone this federacy.","109908":"It's so dangerous to go it alone.","109909":"Don't cut yourself off, you'll really regret it.","109910":"Your first steps towards a gift economy, perhaps?","109911":"We use what we need and keep the rest for a rainy day.","109912":"The leader of the Pyrphorians?! I despise organised religion, you should know.","109913":"Yes, born with privilege, and yet I am willing to sacrifice it— that is the significance of our ideal!","109914":"I am a contradiction? But we are all contradictions! There is no dovecote to house us all, I nest where I land.","109915":"It's unnecessary to make sweeping statements about me, I am an enigma you can't solve.","109916":"Duping the Queen was easy; not once did she and her council envision my betrayal!","109917":"The people don't need convincing! Or do you not believe the absolute trust they place in me is possible?","109918":"My friend, people have minds of their own! Any power to persuade I possess, matters little.","109919":"Don't call me a leader. I am an invisible pilot, guiding those most in need.","109920":"I resented my father all the years he kept servants! In any case, he will no longer speak to me!","109921":"No! I seek no special benefits from my position. I own no position!","109922":"I find comments about my extended family intrusive and deeply offensive.","109923":"An autocracy? If anything it's the opposite. You have no idea what it is I'm trying to achieve!","109924":"In pursuit of truth? Yes, yes, it could be said that I am! I didn't know the power of your words could be so incredible.","109925":"Of course! Ask me anything and I'll tell you, anything at all. I am an open book!","109926":"Well said. If you do not broadcast your love for your people, it cannot be love!","109927":"Many of my dentistry students did look up to me, yes, because unlike my peers I gave them the tools to learn.","109928":"You show signs of cooperation.","109929":"I see you not as ambitious, but audacious.","109930":"We can still grow to revere one another.","109931":"I believe verily, no-one can stop you storming to freedom!","109932":"The people have great admiration for you.","109933":"You are finding your own way of thinking.","109934":"I have to believe human nature is fundamentally good.","109935":"The best dentists are quick to dispense with theory.","109936":"You strike me as a typical capitalist.","109937":"You're an agent of the Queen, don't try to deny it.","109938":"I don't believe in politics, let alone your politics.","109939":"Your self-interest puts me in mind of the academy of medicine.","109940":"Your world seems staid, where is your revolution?","109941":"You're like everyone else I had to suffer at Archibald's garden parties.","109942":"I don't think you can recant your statist tendencies.","109943":"You should be shaking like a— like a wet dog at all the injustice in the world.","109944":"It's an olig…a federation of like-minds.","109945":"We all are caught in this maelstrom together.","109946":"The people are sick to the back teeth of your nepotism.","109947":"The people are reading and hearing all about your collusion.","109948":"The allies of anarchism see through your statist scaremongering.","109949":"The ulcers of your interventionism are risen again!","109950":"The enemies of freedom must be coerced!","109951":"The enemy of the people! Bring the ogre to earth. Destroy them!","109952":"Spreading corruption among my allies is an attack on the free everywhere.","109953":"A fellow anarchist has exposed your underhanded imperialism!","109954":"A spark of mischief in you, I see.","109955":"Regimes are built on deceit, we have to respond in kind.","109972":"We all want a share! What's wrong with that?","109973":"See how the people seize the economy for themselves!","109974":"Can't you see? I'm breaking the cycle of poverty.","109975":"A triumph for anarcho-syndicalism! Every honest fellow will have their plot to work on!","109976":"This land will forevermore live under the flag of anarchy, and all that promises in the imagination!","109977":"The greater the divide between rich and poor, the greater the violence will be!","109978":"Buying your way to a degree, a doctorate, a head of faculty…","109979":"The Queen tried that you know, but the people bought her out! The commoners!","109980":"A single human soul is worth a thousand times what you paid for that island.","109981":"Usurper! Tyrant! You would seize the economy from the people?!","109982":"Land and liberty! Each fresh outcrop a barricade against the people's enemy!","109983":"Not one, but many distinct and autonomous communities!","109984":"Send in your diggers, apportion each man a square of turf.","109985":"Feel the soil between your fingers! The earth is a common treasury!","109986":"The Queen wanted to torch our peaceful commune too, but she saw it would only make things worse.","109987":"We had inspiration to sprinkle over that barren soil, but it's not something you can buy or steal.","109988":"Perhaps you think that's levelling the land.","109992":"Surprise!","109993":"I am no butcher, and this is no war!","109994":"My sabre is drawn to the throat of ambition!","109995":"Shoot then, shoot, what are you waiting for, coward!","109996":"Smash the regime!","110002":"I pledged to protect the people.","110003":"Those meaningless deaths are your work.","110004":"A victory, yet anarchists always remain underdogs!","110005":"No amount of lives weigh heavier than the cause!","110006":"If I am ready to die, so should they have been.","110007":"Ideas always float back to the surface.","110008":"Down with your totalitarian structures!","110009":"Better you undergo this procedure without anaesthetic.","110010":"Everything's falling apart!","110011":"Death and destruction! Hallmarks of the establishment!","110012":"The popular tempest has spun, and the flag of anarchy been driven home like a stake!","110013":"The many headed hydra is decapitated again! This land is claimed for the free!","110014":"To change the master is not to be free! Those people would rather die than serve you.","110015":"Only a tyrant!

A martyr of me! My death means the end for you. I'll die happily!","110018":"How happy and glorious, that you long to reign over us!","110019":"Just when the people want an enemy, you destroy one of their heroes.","110020":"By destroying our enemies, we change them…","110021":"Your victory rouses no leviathan, only the wild and happy monster of freedom.","110022":"A new model army.","110023":"Revolution is no field of clover","110024":"War can only be defeated through war.","110025":"Your bomb-builders know there is no other way.","110026":"I have profound dislike for regiments with regalia.","110027":"Pathetic! There's no bomb better than a book.","110028":"Your forces are fuelled by chest-thumping jingoism.","110029":"You don't need to dismember the state to destroy it.","110030":"I require your immediate society, a tyranny is upon us!","110031":"Time to prove how active you are in the union.","110032":"The people say I risk it all, praise me for that.

Dr. Mercier wants you to increase the production of bread, and stock up on it. Hopefully he has a few tricks to make the stale loaves a little easier on the jaw...","110721":"You want to serve your community? Set them free? Make them self-sufficient, and no mogul will ever have power over them. They must produce all they require!","110722":"Hugo believes your workers will find fulfilment in working harder — much harder — to lift their community. Don't worry! It's not exploitation if the proceeds go to the workers. ","110723":"How it pains me to look at your soulless workers, wasting their spirits away like mindless drudges. Do you know what would give them far more zest than a cup of teeth-yellowing coffee? Working hard to serve their own needs and those of their community, instead of feeding a capitalist leech.","110724":"In a grand gesture to prove to you that his system works just fine, Hugo would like to donate a large amount of his extra stock to you. Sure, his people are perfectly fine with that...","110725":"Once you extract all the crooked incentives that have been fabricated by capitalism to hoard property, people only take as much as they need. We produce so much and gobble up so little, we can barely close our storeroom doors! Take as much as you need — think of it as a sample of what our system can achieve.","110726":"The word about Hugo Mercier's anarchist utopia has travelled far and wide, and reached the ears of a receptive crowd. People from all corners of the world are travelling to join his commune, and Hugo has asked you to grant them a safe passage.","110727":"I don't care who they are or where they come from — if the establishment has them squeezed under its heel, they will be welcomed in our utopia! We can't allow them to suffer any harm — please shelter them on their way to our open arms.","110728":"Goodbye, hunger! Goodbye, freezing nights out on the streets! So long, scornful glances from passers-by...! Hello, Dr. Hugo! Hello, Dr. Hugo! Hello, Dr. Hugo!","110729":"Abolition of God","110730":"Hugo believes that humans are virtuous by nature when they are not forced to compete under the rules of capitalism. Dr. Harvey Sprucer, one of the heads of Social Darwinism in the Old World, begs to differ, and has asked to be taken to Mercier's island to judge with eyes unclouded. Unafraid of confronting challenging ideas, Hugo has accepted, and would like you to provide transport for the gentleman.","110731":"Capitalists love to blame their wretched policies on natural order, but our community exemplifies that humans are nothing but kind to each other when they are not being corrupted. A Social-Darwinist has expressed his desire to see for himself what our ideas translate into. We agreed — he needs only safe transport here.","110732":"That was the healthiest, most edifying debate I have had in a while! Dr. Sprucer has been convinced of the pure-hearted nature of men and women after meeting the most enlightened members of our community. Escort him safely back — he will make a good case for our true spirit to his heartless colleagues.","110733":"Hugo Mercier finds a kindred soul in Jean La Fortune, and has asked you to bring him one of his favourite essay collections as a gift.","110734":"I profoundly admire Mr. La Fortune. A true breaker of chains; founder of a nation free of oppressors! If anything, he should let go of that leadership he grasps so strongly, empower his people, and build up trust. He'd love a read of Krapotkin's \"Reciprocal Support\". Would you take it to him as a token of my esteem?","110735":"Dr. Mercier is radically opposed to all institutions. The police, as a weapon of the state, used to threaten individuals into an unnatural order, is perhaps the one he detests the most. He has challenged you to get rid of all your police stations.","110736":"People's voices must not be repressed under institutional coercion! Snap off the braces, and society will naturally straighten itself. Unless you fear the people's free will.","110737":"No trial is a fair trial under the corrupted laws of capitalism. Hugo has asked you to free some political prisoners from Eli Bleakworth's gaol, so they can be held accountable before his unbiased, enlightened people.","110738":"How can the people be blamed for rebelling against plutocrats? The lives taken by capitalism far exceed the ones those men were driven to take. Of course the corrupt justice system pronounced them guilty...

That is how A Coroa became known— and look where it got us.","110840":"This land was once the pride of A Coroa; King João's summer retreat, and the proposed location of...well never mind that…","110841":"Let you build there, did she? A modern ruler, your Queen, I wouldn't have minded working for her.","110842":"It's no great secret then, we are both looking for the Holy Sceptre of Capon...among other things.","110843":"If we both delve into the haycock for that very special needle, there's more chance at least one of us snags a bloody thumb.","110844":"We may be in a footrace, but there's no need for us to be in each others' way.","110845":"The Holy Sceptre of Capon is irreplaceable. Centuries it presided, in the hands of our rulers, the instrument of our glory.","110846":"Vicente thought it clever to split our national treasure, and the sceptre, across three different ships.

He must not go unpunished!","110920":"Those goods belong to us all in the first place, so he is no thief. He simply needs to learn to reassess the extent of his needs.

Dr. Mercier needs some new tools — and the knowledge of his former mentor, Dr. Harriet Cotton — to treat those who dissent against his policies.","111528":"More and more people are finding reasons to complain about Dr. Mercier's leadership. He, of course, considers this to be a symptom of their foggy minds. Luckily, he's devised a way to clear them: excruciatingly tough labour.","111529":"In an even more eloquent manner than usual, Dr. Hugo Mercier has suggested you install a large volume of gunpowder around the landmark of Her Majesty's justice system: Wormways Prison.","111531":"Dr. Hugo Mercier feels it — the prying gaze of his old comrade Leon upon his every move, waiting for the perfect moment to sell him out to the Queen... In order to either confirm or dispel Mercier's doubts, you must follow the man and see what business he is truly up to.","111533":"What!? A riot!? No, no, no!! Stay where you are! I will not have this! Make them shut up, you incompetent milksops!!","111534":"FOR THE COMMUNE","111535":"A brand new script from the revolutionary playwright Umberto Brocht will be premiered in Hugo Mercier's theatres. \"It is my brainiest, driest, most didactical script thus far\", declared the author about the mandatory cultural event. Preview attendants looked like they tried their very best to enjoy every last bit of entertainment!","111536":"PROTECTIVE CROWN","111537":"Dr. Hugo Mercier has worked on reinforcing his shore's incisors with plenty of metal fillings that will stop cloying capitalists from striking the nerves of his city.","111538":"ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE","111539":"Landslide victory of Dr. Hugo Mercier casts away the fiendish enemies that wish to incarcerate his people within vicious liberalism. Trust towards their selfless leader reaches historical heights, as their profound sense of community strengthens in the face of adversity.","111540":"POPULAR UNISON","111541":"A survey conducted on Dr. Hugo Mercier's island reveals that 100% of its population agrees with every decision their beloved leader makes.","111549":"[AssetData([NotificationContext CharacterGUID]) Text] offers you a propaganda quest.","111550":"[AssetData([NotificationContext CharacterGUID]) Text] offers you a propaganda quest.","111552":"... and we're almost out of medicam-...

Now, if you'll excuse me...","111553":"... what are we going to do when the cold comes b-...? Shh! Good day, comrade! Dr. Hugo? Yes, yes, he's the greatest leader we could ask for! We have nothing — absolutely nothing — bad to say about him. Adieu.","111554":"... there's only so much left after my children have finished eat- W-wow, you startled me! What was I saying? Oh, never mind... We love Dr. Hugo, yes we do! And my children do too! Yes, yes, very much so! Well, good day.","111555":"We aren't conspirators, I swear! My children were hungry — I had to take a bit more than usual! Please, please, don't take us to Dr. Hugo! We can take the next ferry out of here, and you can just pretend you never saw us.","111556":"Please, we have children with us! All we wanted was to live in peace. Have pity, please! I will work for you!","111557":"It's been a long time, Dr. Cotton. Please, make yourself at home. Yes, this is our first patient. He has already been numbed. So, which molar should I pull out...?","111558":"Gunpowder, treason and plot... Such are the charges \"Her Majesty\" holds against me. Yet I am but a vessel that carries the indignant fire of a nation, on my way to ignite the blast that will demolish their fabricated order.","111559":"I see no reason why this gunpowder treason should ever be forgot! May this historical moment provide a blueprint for generations to follow!","111560":"In an almost overly dramatic move, Dr. Hugo has set a whole ship on fire as a metaphor for his bombastic leadership. It now falls to you to be its chaperone, on its way to blow Wormways to pieces.","111561":"After the theatrical detonation at Wormways Prison, many a prisoner managed to escape from their cells and jump into the water. You can't just leave them to drown!","111574":"A fair trade again, Mr. Leon. But I must admit, I am surprised at your colleague, Dr. Mercier. I had imagined an advocate for chaos would be a less reliable supplier. Do give him my compliments.","111575":"A simple trade? He must have noticed you and concealed any sign of his betrayal... There must be something in his books that proves he is double-crossing our people! We must dig deeper!","111577":"Far from being convinced of Leon's innocence, Dr. Mercier has urged you to go through his old colleague's personal records, both at his workplace and his home, to see if you can find any evidence that would prove him guilty of treason.","111580":"My apologies... We've looked everywhere, and there is nothing at all that would lead anyone to believe that Leon is anything but a devoted anarchist and a competent representative of the people...","111581":"What exactly are you looking for? Is my Leon in trouble...? But he's the most loyal man in the world! He talks with such passion about how exciting it is to be part of this revolution, hand in hand with his old friend Hugo...!","111583":"Lies! Of course he made sure to erase every trace of his treachery! Or are you on his side too!? No? Then prove it! Sneak this into his ship's hold! I will expose the viper at any cost, and save my people from his poison!","111584":"Not yet satisfied with the results of your investigation, Dr. Mercier wants you to make sure that there is evidence to incriminate his old friend Leon of conspiring against his regime. Even if you have to create it yourself.","111588":"People from every corner of the world have joined our community since we embarked on this endeavour, but we haven't received any newcomers for months now... I have reason to believe the crown are blockading us. Someone must look into this...","111589":"The number of people joining Dr. Mercier's utopia has suddenly halted, and he suspects the Queen may be to blame. He needs you to conduct some investigations into this matter.","111590":"Help! Please! We were attacked on our way to Dr. Hugo's utopia! Ohh, we worked so hard to build those ships, and now... all of them, burnt to ashes! The attackers, they bore the Crown's sigil! Don't leave us here, I beg you!","111591":"Flamethrowers! So that's what that queen has been up to! Well, I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree after all. We will have to be very wary of them...","111592":"Oh, hello! I merely intended to alert you about Dr. Mercier. He most definitely has a gift with words, but there may be less... consequential content to them than one might imagine. I believe your heart is in the right place, but please... Bear this in mind in future.","111593":"We abhor violence, but this abuse from the Crown must be repaid in kind! So many honest lives lost at sea, and their only crime was to believe a better world was possible! Enough! What goes around comes around.","111594":"Unable to bear the Queen's pressure any longer, Dr. Mercier has asked you to help him warn her that any harm she does to his people will be returned.","111595":"Whyever would you do that!? Attacks...? Well, I can assure you Her Majesty knows absolutely nothing about that! He is manipulating you like he manipulated all those people! Do not fall for it, I sincerely beg of you. Stay loyal to your queen!","111596":"You have earned our trust. My trust. Being discreet as you always are, you will have no problem delivering this man to the royal residence unseen. Believe me, it is of the utmost importance.","111597":"Dr. Mercier requires you to sneak past Sir Archibald's patrols, and make sure a very enigmatic masked man arrives at High Clarence Hall docks unseen. Where have you seen that mask before...?","111602":"The fuse is burning, we must brace for the grand finale! As the royal fleet heads for us, you must decide: are you willing to fight for enlightenment and equality, or will you support centuries of oppression and obscurantism?","111603":"After months of tensions between Mercier and the Crown, the conflict is about to reach an armed resolution. You must now choose which side you are on: anarchy or monarchy.","111604":"A truly individual thinker! I am so proud of you, comrade! Here — our scientists have developed these explosives. Regrettably, we will very soon be needing them.","111605":"Thank you for staying a sane constant throughout this most regrettable affair... Her Majesty didn't want things to come to this, but alas, it seems to be the only way forward now...","111606":"The flame has risen, our job is done. Time to report back.","111607":"You have spotted a mysterious ship observing the battle from afar. Follow them, and find out what their role was in the events that just unfolded.","111608":"Everything went exactly as planned. Now both Mercier and the Queen are weak enough for us to take control. Igne Natura Renovatur! Wait, who are you...? Intruders! They mustn't escape!","111609":"It can't be... Were the Pyrphorians manipulating us all from the start? Oh dear... Dr. Mercier really did believe it was us who attacked his people. I must speak to him at once — as much as we disagree, neither of us meant these hostilities.","111610":"The... the Pyrphorians...? But... No, it was the Queen...! She hates our utopia — she is a despot and a schemer! Those people must have been under her command all along! Yes.... yes, that's it...","111612":"War declared on Dr. Hugo Mercier","111613":"Alliance signed with Dr. Hugo Mercier","111614":"Peace signed with Dr. Hugo Mercier","111615":"Trade Rights signed with Dr. Hugo Mercier","111618":"Built Trade Union","111619":"Built Church/Chapel","111620":"Built Alcohol Production","111621":"Built Fur Dealer","111622":"Built Clockmakers","111623":"Built Cigar Factory","111624":"Built Potato Farm","111625":"Built Framework Knitters","111626":"Built Police Station","111627":"Used anarchist propaganda","111628":"Attracted first workers","111630":"Dr. Hugo Mercier looks down on you for producing alcohol.","111631":"Dr. Hugo Mercier hates fur coats.","111632":"Dr. Hugo Mercier abhors clocks.","111633":"Dr. Hugo Mercier admires the backbone of cigar makers.","111634":"Dr. Hugo Mercier applauds your production of potatoes.","111635":"Dr. Hugo Mercier commends you on building framework knitters.","111636":"Dr. Hugo Mercier praises you for building a trade union.","111637":"Dr. Hugo Mercier detests you for promoting religion.","111647":"Dr. Hugo Mercier is disgusted by your police station.","111648":"Dr. Hugo Mercier rejoices at the riots happening in your city,","111649":"Dr. Hugo Mercier admires you for publishing the truth.","111650":"Dr. Hugo Mercier detests you for lying to your citizens.","111651":"Dr. Hugo Mercier supports your use of anarchist propaganda.","111679":"I am not here to escape domestic dissatisfaction, but to address it. Our nation has lost its pride! But pride can be restored! This place, Trelawney, is the site of my father's great naval victory over our rivals La Corona.","111680":"Finding the sunken Sceptre of Capon — the trophy we never claimed for that victory — will remind us of our past glories and restore the people's faith in their monarch.","111681":"Dear old Archie has been like a father to me, but had I told him I was coming here, he'd have sent for far too many flowers and servants.","111682":"Ever been on a treasure hunt? Mother let me out in the garden on sunny days.","111683":"I had rather a stuffy childhood. So being out here, free and incognito, has one feeling pretty giddy.","111684":"As this could easily be my last unofficial visit anywhere, I intend to enjoy my freedom.","111685":"We share a bloodline, you know. I have as much right to the Sceptre as King João.","111686":"The Sceptre of Capon has long granted its bearers indisputable authority. But it sank to the depths, along with La Corona's fleet.","111687":"It was father's greatest regret that he was never able to hold the sceptre. I'm sure that insecurity about his position made him cling to power all the more perfervidly.","111688":"He may have been on the winning side, but father always said Admiral Nadasky's carelessness had meant the Sceptre being lost to the waves.","111689":"We were the victors here at Trelawney, yet all the spoils remain in the lap of Poseidon.","111690":"Father's command from up on the cliff, that's what won us the day. Not the actions of the much-trumpeted Admiral Nadasky.","111691":"The child that was me played out the battle of Trelawney countless times in the parlour on a miniature campaign table.","111692":"I can still smell father's victory here at Trelawney, it is his greatest legacy.","111693":"I am curious as to how father was able to relay these instructions so quickly from such a distance.","111694":"La Corona wanted to move their national treasures while they still had chance, but the fleet caught them in the act.","111695":"The warm southern air makes me feel strong and well. Purposeful, you might say.","111696":"I can see it — a brilliant metropolis rising here, from the memory of the victory my father masterminded. A shining new jewel in the crown of my empire.","111697":"I see the new settlement is progressing well. The empire needs to develop a lasting presence here in the south.","111698":"A humble outpost now, perhaps. But it promises to become the largest capital of my empire!","111699":"It's obvious why they're here. It's the same reason we're here; for the emblematic power that sceptre will grant to whoever owns it.","111700":"One imagined if one was secretive enough, La Corona might not discover one's intentions — yet of course, here they are at the double.","111701":"Admiral Nadasky writes that he defied the orders of my father! That treasonous Jack Tar, father should have had his head!","111702":"Another part of Admiral Nadasky's logbook… Fascinating reading…","111703":"This entry shows that they persisted in deviating from father's instructions…","111704":"This log is proof Nadasky may at least have had good intentions in his defiance of father's orders.","111705":"The King, my father, draws further away from his daughter with each new revelation in Nadasky's log.","111706":"The facts here are plain. Had they followed only father's orders, La Corona would have won.","111707":"I may have been wrong about Admiral Nadasky. Upon my return to the capital, I shall have a great big pillar built in his honour.","111708":"I always believed my father, when he claimed to be the unsung mastermind of the battle of Trelawney, but it was Nadasky all along that was saving his blushes.","111709":"Father should have trusted those with naval expertise… I mean, it's now quite obvious he had little of that expertise himself.","111710":"Some of father's orders were utterly baffling…","111711":"Isn't he the spit of those chaps in the beggar's opera? We do so want to like the poor.","111712":"He's with us, one hopes? Or is he the peculiar sort who doesn't take sides?","111713":"The empire needs these potterers; those willing to try new things.","111714":"What a remarkable innovation! Can I have a go?","111715":"My mother had a great deal of trouble saying the words \"ocean bottom\", but I find I have no difficulty at all!","111716":"Now, if it were the centrepiece of a grand exhibition, the people in these parts would be reminded of just how far-reaching the influence of an empress can be.","111717":"When the exhibition is over, do remember to give it to my busbies, so I can toss it in with the rest of the bling.","111718":"This waterlogged log is in a terrible state. Did you not bring any art restorers with you?","111719":"One is no dunce-hatted imbecile, but I rather think we'll need a class swot or two to decipher this; a university with a budding college of palaeographers to decipher Nadasky's shameful handwriting. ","111720":"Oh, it's all much clearer now! Do thank your expert bods at the University for all their brio.","111721":"The sceptre is worthless if it is not whole.","111722":"Why did their Admiral Silva think it prudent to break up a lucky sceptre?","111723":"Let us see if you have the prowess of Admiral Nadasky…","111724":"In a way, I would be excited to see the battle of Trelawney recreated!","111725":"This Oliveira reeks of defeat! You just have to tip the scales...","111726":"I dreamed of seeing such a battle at Trelawney every night as a child!","111727":"Marvellous! You know, now I that see it, it really doesn't look much like an eagle, does it? Oh well — none of my subjects will ever dare to question it!","111728":"My gratitude is heartfelt.  This is a new emblem of state behind which my subjects will surely rally!","111729":"I hear it has been stolen from the exhibition?! Crime is becoming a terrible problem for the empire. I will find that sceptre, but for now, I'm sorry your efforts have gone in vain.","111730":"So the Sceptre of Capon has somehow made it into the hands of La Corona? Well-played… but it jolly billy better not have been you responsible!","111731":"But, in the end, I care less for the sceptre, and more for Nadasky's revelations concerning my father.","111732":"The father I saw — the great tactician — appears never to have existed; and yet a daughter's love prevails through the absurdity of his weakness.","111733":"Used martial law propaganda","111735":"Dr. Hugo Mercier approves of your workers.","111736":"Dr. Hugo Mercier despises your investors.","111738":"Attracted first investors","111739":"Welcome to Trelawney, graveyard to thousands; the gift that keeps on giving, he he.","111740":"Trelawney, site of one of the great naval battles, now a veritable trove of lost treasure.","111741":"There's plunder to be had if you sink down deep enough. I may be able to help you along a tad with that.","111742":"There's a lot of meat and cartilage left on the bones of these ships, especially on their underbellies.","111743":"Don't worry about what he's up to. You just concentrate on your own digging.","111744":"This Vasco looks stiffer than week-old bat kabob— on his last legs, like. No match for someone like you. ","111745":"Work with Oliveira? Who said that, he he! No, no, no — I'm all yours!","111746":"Yaps a lot about his cousin, I find. Easy to boot a man when he's down, eh?","111747":"Even after all this time, you still see the odd eyeball surface, belched up from that tomb of a trench below.","111748":"Terrible, wars, ain't they? Well, for the luckless beggars who have to fight in them… ha ha ha!","111749":"Sometimes you'll see a skull on the seabed, watchin' you like. I just smile back.","111750":"If you're waiting for them dead sailors to give you permission, you'll be waiting a long time, ha ha ha ha!","111751":"Don't plan on fixing yourself there too long — this place is like a thoroughfare for conqueror-types.","111752":"Your peninsula might be under Queenie's umbrella for now, but I know from experience — nothing ever lasts.","111753":"If you don't pick a side, you can't wind up on the wrong one.","111754":"While the big boys and girls are duking it out, the likes of you and I can sneak stuff away while they ain't looking.","111755":"Alright, you got me. I've been helping Vasco. Now, don't take offence, old mucker — it=s only common sense to back both horses.","111756":"How's about I do you a special favour — just for you mind — to make up for my heinous betrayal of trust…","111757":"I'm more interested in all the other sweet collector's items down there.","111758":"All so hung up on that chicken-on-a-stick — what about the rest of the Trelawney hoard!","111759":"Forget all that old flannel about her father — old Queenie's in it for the loot just as much as we are.","111760":"Don't forget — Admiral Nadasky disobeyed his King, and it all paid off.","111761":"Being a prototype, I will ask you sign a waiver for yer life, before you use it.","111762":"Without the metal shell, you're as vulnerable as a homeless hermit crab.","111763":"The Trelawney hoard's a diversion — everyone's forgotten all the older, more valuable finds.","111764":"I have a personal asphyxiation with underwater treasure.","111765":"Watch out for them octopuses, they like to keep all the good stuff under wraps.","111766":"The diving bell gives them sharks something to chew on, at least.","111767":"See anything shiny down there, then?","111768":"Any mermaids open their purses of pearls for yer, then?","111769":"Never be too sure that the life's all gone out of something.","111770":"It'd cost you an arm and a leg to buy that new.","111771":"Waste not, want not.","111772":"It's been reincarnated!","111773":"Looks like it was made to be split into three. Shouldn't be too hard to put back together...","111774":"There you have it! One reconstituted chicken stick, good as new.","111775":"The maiden descent for me beautiful diving bell! I've got all three of me fingers crossed for you, you little ocean-going guinea pig, you.","111776":"Botched the dive, did ya? Glass all get misted up or something?","111777":"Hopefully the water won't gush in like the only other time I tested it. Well, good luck!","111778":"Either you've got the bends, or you've come back disappointed.","111779":"Corr, that'll fetch a few clams…","111780":"Now here's something; a proper pressure gauge. You'll be able to go to much deeper and darker places now…","111781":"This balloon is a rather special innovation of mine! Gives you a much better view of them hidden reefs!","111782":"Now this is arguably my greatest invention to date! 'S'like invisible hands reaching through the air, and… there! That sound will keep you true.","111783":"He's quite clever that Vasco, I'll give him that.","111784":"Maybe I'll wait until you two finish each other off before diving in.","111785":"Another battle of Trelawney? Oh goody!","111786":"There you go! I told you I'd give you special treatment.","111787":"There! Never say I don't care about you — even if it is true.","111788":"The spaniel fetches the stick for its Queen then, eh? Well, a man like me can't afford to be loyal.","111789":"It'd be funnier if you gave the three of us one bit each…","111790":"Give me the sceptre? Corr, I'm honoured! And rich! Haha, good on yer — my absolute gamble on you has paid off.","111791":"You do realise I'm just going to sell this sceptre to the highest bidder, right? So no moral victory for you, if that's what you thought it was.","111792":"You gave it back to La Corona, 'cos it was theirs to begin with!? Whatever happened to finders keepers?","111793":"Maybe that miserable geezer Vasco will be happy now. Or maybe not. That's how it is with miserable geezers.","111794":"Exhibition royalties?

They are insisting you publish an image of one of his islands in your newspaper — even if it tarnishes your own reputation in the process.","111902":"Dr. Mercier's ideas are spreading among your residents, and they're beginning to suspect it is only you who benefits from all they produce. They demand a large quantity of the steel beams and weapons they've sweated over be awarded to them.","111903":"The workers have become acquainted with some aspects of anarchist theory, and they now demand to be compensated for all the value their labour has lost on the capitalist free market.","111904":"Your workers will not settle for the crumbs! If you want to keep your empire from crumbling from within, you'd better keep their bellies full.","111905":"Your workers are claiming their right to control and manage the means of production. A trade union would be the perfect space for them to come together and debate.","111906":"Your workers are fed up with having their minds numbed by religion. They demand you take down a church and replace it with a town hall — or else...","111907":"It's important for your workers that you make sure your nation is self-sufficient, and doesn't rely on goods from other nations. They will not be satisfied until your trade balance is positive.","111908":"Overproducing, Mercier argues, is actually a good thing for the people, since the prices drop so much it becomes unnecessary to track who helps themselves to what. That is what your workers want for your island too.","111909":"When police are everywhere, justice is nowhere. So your workers have come to believe after learning more about anarchy. They have destroyed all your police stations, and their violence will resume if you can't maintain the peace without them.","111910":"Fed up with an unjust system, your people demand you institute laws that protect the common classes.","111911":"Your workers are thrilled by everything they've learnt about anarchy. In fact, so taken are they that they've stayed up all night creating a poster to paste on your town hall.","111912":"There is no stopping these workers from leaving your island to join Dr. Mercier's people, but if you still want to be decent towards them, you can make sure they at least have safe passage to his island.","111913":"The only reason your workers are starting to find anarchy attractive is because they are miserable. Well, maybe miserable is putting a bit strongly, but they could certainly be happier!","111914":"You are at odds with Dr. Hugo Mercier, which means your workers — who look up to the anarchist leader — are at odds with you. Perhaps winning the heart of the doctor will earn you the love of your people.","111915":"THE BLESSINGS OF ANARCHY","111916":"An unprecedented photographic report illustrates the idyllic life of people on Dr. Hugo Mercier's island, where all individuals are equal, and not one is better clothed or fed than their neighbour.","111921":"DLC: Megaphone Tower Ornament","111922":"DLC: Anarchist Banner Ornament","111923":"DLC: Anarchist Ensemble","111924":"Santíssima Vitória","111925":"Dr. Mercier's voice drills into the minds of his followers from these towers.","111926":"No God, No Masters!","111927":"Cargo Ship","111928":"Schooner","111929":"Megaphone Tower","111930":"Anarchy Banner","111935":"A concerned artisan pleads for you to prevent the rise of anarchism.","111936":"A concerned investor pleads for you to prevent the rise of anarchism.","111937":"A concerned farmer pleads for you to prevent the rise of anarchism.","111938":"A concerned engineer pleads for you to prevent the rise of anarchism.","111941":"Meet Dr. Hugo Mercier, the Anarchist.

Please, if there's anything we can do — any way at all that we could be of use to you — allow me to repay your kindness with my expertise!","111970":"Make no mistake — I might look like a worker, but I'm a trained engineer. I joined Mercier on the promise of a better world, but it turned out to be a fallacy... My designs will serve a better purpose here.","111971":"I was so fed up with Mercier screaming lies at our faces with this loudspeaker, I just had to take it away from him! Ugh, I can't even stand the sight of this wretched thing. Take it off me, please!","111972":"A panicked artisan came looking for your help.

It doesn't matter whether their ideas are valid or not — in her eyes, no book must ever be burnt.","111975":"As much as Dr. Mercier likes to brag that anarchy is peaceful, his followers on your island seem to have a different perspective. They've wrecked an investor's residence, and he's now demanding that you build him a new one, at once.","111976":"The anarchist attacks are not only targeting wealthy investors, but humble artisans too. With his business reduced to ashes, this poor man has lost his livelihood. Help him restore it.","111977":"Among the people who arrived from Dr. Mercier's island, some have pledged to work for you as a way of repaying you for your hospitality.","111978":"There was a brilliant engineer amongst the last batch of anarchist defectors you allowed into your city.

A first-hand testimony of the Empire's history.","112411":"The Queen wants to delve into what happened to Richardson and his crew.","112412":"The Queen refers you to Nadasky's sketch of La Corona's flagship.","112413":"The Queen urges you to dive down to the wreckage of the Santíssima Vitória.","112414":"The Queen exhorts you to collect Vasco's piece of the sceptre.","112415":"Old Nate offers to restore the sceptre.","112416":"The Queen wants you to showcase the Sceptre of Capon.","112417":"The Queen inaugurates the exhibition of the Sceptre of Capon.","112418":"Crown Falls, a rich and majestic land overlooking the bay of Trelawney, is where the Empire once won their much-heralded victory over La Corona. In other words, the perfect place to establish a new capital for the Queen.","112419":"The spoils left behind by the battle of Trelawney have attracted many a treasure hunter. The Queen recalls spotting someone that may prove useful in her quest to retrieve the Sceptre of Capon, and wants you to find and commission him.","112420":"You have acquired a diving bell from Old Nate. There's no way to know if the creaky prototype will hold up until you try it...","112421":"The test dive went well enough, but the bell came up with nothing but worthless junk. Old Nate won't mind, though — he has a knack for finding value in everything. Bring the scrap to him, and he may be able to make something useful out of it.","112422":"After your unfruitful diving attempt, Old Nate has taken pity on you. He'll let you have the co-ordinates of a juicy diving site, for what he claims is a reasonable price.","112423":"Old Nate has given you the co-ordinates for a promising diving spot. Sail your salvager there — it's as good a spot as any to start looking for the Sceptre of Capon.","112424":"You've recovered Nadasky's journal, but its pages are barely readable. Exposing the fragile pages to a long sea journey would be too risky. Instead, you must make room for art restorers at Crown Falls.","112425":"Artisans will begin the restoration of Nadasky's journal by rebinding it. They need flour for the glue, and sewing machines for the stitching.","112426":"While Nadasky's journal is being restored, the Queen wants you to establish a university in the region; its scholars should be able to help decipher the journal's contents.","112427":"The first few pages of the journal are a first-hand account of the naval battle at Trelawney — it's evident Nadasky didn't think much of the King's strategy. The log also hints at the compass bearings at which you may find the sceptre.","112428":"Nadasky pinpointed the great battleground of Trelawney in his journal as being somewhere to the east of Crown Falls. Chances are that part of the sceptre sank along with one of the many ships that fell during battle — but there are still active sea mines all over the area. Perhaps Old Nate has some apparatus that can help you navigate those dangerous waters.","112429":"Once again, it seems you're not the first to come to Old Nate for help; he's already used up all his materials putting something together for Vasco. Nevertheless, he is prepared to help you catch up, if you bring him the scrap he needs...","112430":"Thanks to Old Nate's invention, you can now take your diving bell to the battle site without fear of stumbling into mines — old or new — and find the rest of the sceptre.","112431":"You were too late. The second piece of the Sceptre of Capon has fallen into the hands of Vasco Oliveira. But, unlike his cousin Vicente, Oliveira prefers to settle matters without violence. He has proposed a deal: if you are the first to recover the last piece of the sceptre — the Eagle — he will surrender the pommel. But if he gets to it first, you will have to hand over the rod section you found.","112432":"The scholars say Nadasky's Journal is about as good as they're ever going to get it. Hopefully, it will give you more clues about what happened during the battle, and what became of the last part of the sceptre.","112433":"Nadasky reveals in his journal that, despite his best attempts to avoid it, the King sent a frigate — the HMS Ajax — to chase after the Santíssima Vitória in an attempt to retrieve the Sceptre of Capon. No good came from this command: La Corona's flagship was never seen again, and the Ajax's crew all lost their lives after being stranded on an island without fresh water for a week. Her Majesty believes that you may find more clues about the whereabouts of the flagship if you look into the fate of Richardson and his sailors.","112434":"Thanks to Richardson's log, you know that the Santíssima Vitória crashed on the east coast of Crown Falls. Her Majesty is certain that the eagle section of the Sceptre sank along with the ship, but where exactly? There are many such wrecks along those cliffs. Luckily, there may be a clue — Nadasky was so struck by his first sight of the Santíssima Vitória that he sketched it in his journal.","112435":"The Santíssima Vitória — the magnificent ship-of-the-line that was the pride of La Corona — lies broken on the seabed, as if it were the skeleton of a colossal whale. Scour the bottom of the ocean, scrape every bone, and find the gleaming eagle — that timeless emblem of empire.","112436":"The contract is unequivocal: whoever finds the Eagle of the Sceptre first, shall receive the third piece from the counterparty. The Eagle is in your hands, so Vasco Oliveira has no choice other than to surrender the sceptre's pommel to you.","112437":"Despite Old Nate's attempt to lay his hands on the sceptre, the Queen has chosen to leave the restoration to the trained art restorers of Crown Falls. They will see to it the moment they have the special materials they require.","112438":"The Sceptre of Capon has been recovered and restored — along with the pride of the Empire, apparently. The Queen has little use for it locked up in a vault: she wants her subjects to come from every corner of the nation to behold the sceptre in all its glory.","112439":"The Sceptre of Capon has been recovered and restored — along with the pride of the Empire, apparently.

We must first see to the binding: people tell me a flour-based glue will be gentler on such a delicate manuscript than an acid one, and that we'll also want the precision and punch of modern sewing machines for the stitching.","112445":"§--112445--§","112446":"The Queen is glad that the first pages are now legible.","112447":"The Queen encourages you to explore the locations mentioned in Nadasky's journal.","112448":"The Queen recognises this as the spot from Nadasky's journal.","112449":"The Queen is disappointed to discover that the sceptre is incomplete.","112450":"Vasco Oliveira admits he too is looking for the sceptre.","112451":"Vasco Oliveira explains that the sceptre is not whole, but split into three.","112452":"We've just received the final versions of the next few pages of the journal. Be gentle with them, the ink is still fresh!","112453":"The Queen is engrossed in Nadasky's account of the Battle of Trelawney.","112454":"The Queen believes Old Nate can help you find the treasure and avoid the sea mines.","112455":"Old Nate presents you with the echo-locator.","112456":"Vasco Oliveira announces that he has found the second piece of the Sceptre.","112457":"Vasco Oliveira proposes an all-or-nothing deal.","112458":"The Queen suggests you win the bet - or else.","112459":"The Queen is sure the last piece of the sceptre sank with La Corona's flagship.","112460":"The Queen examines the Eagle of the Sceptre.","112461":"Vasco Oliveira cedes the sceptre to you, and leaves Trelawney.","112462":"The Queen is bemused at Vasco's sense of integrity.","112463":"The Queen would never trust the sceptre to Old Nate.","112464":"The Queen suggests leaving it to the artisans.","112465":"Ahh, the sceptre! A wonderful piece! But it has suffered structural damage — we will need metal to restore it to glory!","112466":"The soul of the sceptre has returned, but it still needs plating in precious metals.","112467":"The Sceptre of Capon has almost been returned to its former splendour! There are just two final details missing: the inlay of pearl it once had, and the delicate filigree I have seen in the paintings.","112468":"We are finally finished. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest masterpiece we have ever laid eyes upon. We hope Her Majesty will be satisfied with our work.","112469":"The Queen thanks you for restoring the Sceptre of Capon.","112470":"The Queen is very pleased with your powers of presentation.","112471":"The Queen expresses her heartfelt gratitude for your service.","112472":"The Queen trusts you now.","112473":"The Queen grants you full ownership of Crown Falls.","112476":"The Kraken","112477":"Kraken Pit","112478":"Atlantean Wall","112479":"Atlantean Wall","112480":"Temple of Poseidon","112481":"Court of Laws","112482":"Orichalcum Statue","112483":"Temple of Poseidon","112484":"Court of Laws","112485":"Orichalcum Statue","112486":"Music Pavilion","112487":"Sheet Music \"Anno 1701\"","112488":"This unpredictable prototype was originally built to gain an unfair advantage at steam car races.","112489":"A reinforced variant, which in spite of the minor combustion risk, takes all the labour out of warehouse work.","112490":"Old Nate's baby.

Such a disproportionate escort suggests that our informants were correct: they must be transporting the Sceptre of Capon that our King is seeking.","112544":"La Corona opened fire this morning. We engaged in battle at 10am, south east of the region — a conflict which lasted until seven in the evening.<br/>We lost many good men today — the sly young Admiral Silva having deployed mines to protect the enemy convoy. It was the King's command that we attack in a single line, parallel to the enemy formation. Fortunately, I was able to persuade the fleet to ignore this instruction, and instead arrange themselves into two perpendicular columns to cut through the enemy line — and as a corollary, avoid the mines. Our lead ships were blown apart, but it left a path clear for the rest of us. The enemy fleet, being snipped into thirds, were vulnerable to broadsides. We proceeded to drive them toward their own mines, and though in the mayhem there were casualties on both sides, we knew victory for the Empire had been won.<br/>We thank those brave sailors who lost their lives today that we ourselves survived, and shall never forget their sacrifice. The price would have been far greater had we sworn blind obedience to the King's strategy.","112545":"The King is, indeed, mad. He appears to care nothing for our victory, and was upset in the extreme to learn that we hadn't yet begun pursuit of the Santíssima Vitória, for he is adamant that the Sceptre of Capon is on board.<br/> Having received word that the flagship was heading northeast, His Majesty ordered Captain Richardson — of the HMS Ajax — to go after her. Under no circumstances will he permit us to accompany them. I have tried to inform the King that the Ajax is ill-equipped for the duel, but my injury leaves me weak, and I have had to retire to my quarters.

Once we had disembarked, I improvised a foundation in geology for the stupids.","115803":"I'm no zany inventor, dear me, no—no need for imagination whatsoever, it's exact, often tedious work.","115804":"Sir John Faithful's expedition was to catalog the Arctic in every detail; I'd have enjoyed that sort of freedom myself...","115805":"This Spoondrift character has no scientific credentials whatsoever, and yet he has been put in charge.","115806":"Bring in top mechanics, leave them out in the cold…","115807":"How can one operate machinery, when one has a case of the dithers?","115808":"Note please, the horripilation of my dextral epiderm!","115809":"I could describe in microscopic detail what is happening to my poor body, but I doubt you'd understand.","115810":"A hard rime has formed upon my brow.","115811":"A mite of calculation required.","115812":"A problem requiring meticulous dissection.","115813":"Don't deal with it like Spoondrift would.","115814":"Needs taking apart, and putting back together again.","115815":"Have a look at this…","115816":"I do have one or two concerns…","115817":"It is proving a bit of a puzzle…","115818":"What's your conjecture?","115819":"In this, you may have more experience than I, possibly…","115820":"The salient issue of the moment, I'd say…","115821":"Passion for the subject is essential.","115822":"Don't drift off course.","115823":"It's not especially urgent.","115824":"Up, up, and away.","115825":"Fair winds.","115826":"I won't presume 'til I hear further news.","115827":"Don't let this miserable place put you off.","115828":"Going about it with due rigour, I hope?","115829":"Don't let it drag on forever.","115830":"The sun may not go down, but time still passes.","115831":"It's like dealing with undergraduates.","115832":"Went down like a lead balloon.","115833":"Just needed the bare minimum of application.","115834":"Deferred it is.","115835":"Do make up your mind.","115836":"I see you've abandoned the idea.","115837":"Greater priorities, perhaps.","115838":"Rather an extreme reaction isn't it?","115839":"Got something?","115840":"Borne fruit has it?","115841":"Progress?","115842":"Results?","115843":"A discovery?","115844":"A solution?","115845":"New finds?","115846":"What?","115847":"A well-argued conclusion.","115848":"Proof that no challenge here is to be feared.","115849":"A rigorous examination of the topic.","115850":"Top marks.","115851":"Painstaking.","115852":"Hmm, curious.","115853":"Now we're getting somewhere.","115854":"Now there's something substantial.","115855":"The plot, and the snow, thickens.","115856":"Forensic analysis wanted.","115857":"Some rather gruesome remains.","115858":"Onwards?","115859":"Ready?","115860":"All set?","115861":"Confident?","115862":"Are we go?","115863":"Always willing to share the plaudits.","115864":"Call it a research award.","115865":"You're quite welcome.","115866":"Prego.","115867":"Yes I'm a zeppelin technician, but really, I'm much more than that.","115868":"Notice a certain frostiness?","115869":"Don't you wind chill me!","115870":"Is this a cryogenic study?","115871":"We're absoutely nithering.","115872":"Hell is frozen over.","115873":"Out of ten?

You zestless zounderkite!","250193":"Don't give me fimble-fambles, I deal in results.","250194":"What can possibly be the delay?","250195":"I'll have perished at this rate.","250196":"Where are you, dung-sifter?","250197":"Butter upon bacon, I have more for you …","250198":"There's no end to the profits in this.","250199":"I see a glimmer in this pan yet...","250200":"Surely you want to distance yourself from that simpleton?","250201":"Clearly not as distinguished a responsibility as this…","250229":"Von Malching is the name on everyone's lips at society gatherings.","250230":"I'd dress as your grandmother if it meant I could lay hands on your lovely lucre!","250231":"My business is other people's money. Your money, to be exact.","250232":"I shall capitalise on this.","250233":"Such juicy prospects.","250234":"Fizzing!","250235":"Very good for me.","250236":"The promise is ravishing!","250237":"That's good gravy!","250238":"Greatly to my advantage.","250239":"So, you can be useful.","250241":"I loathe to admit it, but you've done well.","250242":"Impressive, what's your secret? Not that I need it.","250243":"If you're happy with mediocre, then I'm happy too.","250244":"Well, bully for you!","250245":"Not entirely feeble. Not strong, but not feeble.","250246":"You might just be the best of a bad set.","250247":"I am vexed.","250248":"Confound this blasted matter.","250249":"This has upset my plans!","250250":"Absurd, I won't have it!","250251":"Nooooooooo!","250252":"Inconceivable!","250253":"What the devil?!","250257":"I expect no less, from a bluebottle.","250258":"Whenever it rains, you worm to the surface.","250262":"Your family crest is seething with rot!","250263":"You remind me of my father, spineless!","250264":"You handle this business like a guttersnipe.","250265":"You dare deny the cat his milk!","250266":"Your actions betray your commonness.","250267":"You're yet another mangy travelling circus, here today, gone tomorrow.","250269":"Don't expect me to shake your disease-ridden hand.","250272":"You, is it.","250274":"Oh I'm sorry, have we met?","250275":"Another interruption. Better be worth it.","250276":"What a deep voice I have. All the better to greet you with!","250277":"Want something, or simply admiring my realms?","250278":"Stumbling into the lion's jaws?","250279":"Good, then you know where the door is.","250280":"Don't loiter, you'll depreciate the value of this neighbourhood!","250282":"Keen to experience the dizzying razzle-dazzle of city life?","250283":"Ever seen a finer example than this? Of course you haven't.","250284":"Look upon the majesty, and weep.","250285":"Wish you had a vessel this stately do you?","250286":"I don't mind losing the odd sailor, as long as they bring in the bounty.","250287":"I associate boats with treasure.","250288":"We're looking for a deck-scrubber, since you like boats so much.","250289":"I deserve this.","250290":"Capital.","250291":"Bang up to the elephant.","250292":"Oh if I must.","250293":"Only because it suits me.","250294":"Alright.","250295":"An emphatic no!","250296":"Certainly not!","250297":"Has the world gone loopy?","250301":"The brutes are rich, and the meek impoverished, all is as it should be in the world!","250302":"My factories use every part of the pig but the squeal. Squeamish workers can be found other situations!","250303":"I sometimes feel for the little people; too busy working to earn any money.","250304":"I held a modest function for society's distinguished. A five-course dinner, a masquerade, a forty-piece orchestra, rose petals billowing from the rafters. Maybe I'll invite you next time, but then... maybe not.","250305":"Some were born, silver spoon in mouth. Once I'd wrenched it from father's feeble grasp that is.","250306":"Miss Jorgensen is an intriguing creature. Naïve, but of good blood. Once she replies to my offer of marriage, we shall breed children of ambition and status.","250307":"Since Miss Qing is rather new, I'll show her the lay of the land. Then have first dibs on her eastern fortune!","250308":"Beryl O'Mara clings to society like a leech. Her chief of police should arrest her where she stands.","250309":"Why do they celebrate that fop Gasparov at the club? All he does is blither about buttresses!","250310":"Why is it prattlers like Wibblesock are always so insistent?! Does the dratted imbecile never sleep?!","250311":"George Smith's hard life, blah-blah-blah. Haven't I had to struggle!? A name in tatters, and yet now, across everybody's lips!","250313":"Graves?! The mutation? The model of maleficence?! The ripper who robbed the barber?","250314":"Vicente Silva has had an easy life; anybody in his boots would have succeeded. I meanwhile, rise to prominence on merit!","250315":"When Lady Hunt invited me in for afternoon tea, I felt an unspoken bond between us. Sophistication!","250316":"The Queen is fond of me, and vice-versa. But her administration is a scandal! I demand a barony!","250317":"Archie Blake is a sniveller. He somehow cosied up to the Queen, and has remained an obsequious parasite ever since.","250324":"We won't shake on it, you probably spit on your hands.","250325":"I pity you, is why I indulge you.","250326":"I'm a philanthropist.","250327":"Trade can be so demeaning.","250328":"And despite a yawning gulf in status.","250329":"Noblesse oblige!","250330":"Regard my largesse!","250361":"My lavish offer.","250362":"Take it or leave it.","250363":"It's as low as I will stoop.","250364":"Read while I floss my moustache.","250365":"Me at my most generous.","250366":"You don't deserve better than this …","250367":"Don't waste my time with counter-offers!","250368":"I am a wolf, and you, a sheep come to dinner.","250369":"I'll scrape off your carapace you wood weevil!","250370":"I long to burst you like a bubo.","250371":"I have you between my fat palms ready to squish.","250372":"Quite reasonable, considering ...","250373":"Don't mind if I do.","250374":"What a steal!","250375":"See! I'm no miser!","250376":"A most favourable result.","250377":"Putrescent pinchfist!","250378":"And sign my life away?!","250379":"You stiff-neck scrooge!","250380":"A scandalous offer!","250381":"Skinflint!","250382":"I'll be the one who does the exploiting!","250383":"The fat needs trimming.","250384":"As I want it, or not at all…","250385":"You deranged rhinoceros!","250386":"This deal is good for me in any case.","250387":"Meal-mouth fitch.","250388":"I've seen scarier chipmunks.","250389":"Please, don't make me laugh!","250390":"What will you do? Pepper me with haberdasher's buttons?","250391":"You'll appreciate this.","250392":"Let me help you.","250393":"Here's charity.","250394":"No need to thank me.","250395":"And they say I'm unkind...","250396":"Well, what did you expect?!","250397":"Eat humble pie.","250398":"You pushed me to this.","250399":"You deserve even worse.","250400":"Let me put you in your place.","250401":"I wage war against you and your pigeon-liver plebs.","250402":"A war with you is a surefire investment.","250403":"House von Malching goes to war!","250404":"This war is a waste of time for both of us.","250405":"What if I were to let you off the hook?","250406":"Better let you catch your breath.","250407":"Towel off the sweat while you may.","250408":"It will help your exiguous business along.","250409":"I don't expect this favour will be repaid.","250410":"You would be joining an elite club.","250411":"You never had anything I needed.","250412":"We always throw your junk into the sea.","250413":"Why I degraded myself to your level...!","250418":"Who would decline a match with a von Malching?","250419":"A most illustrious alliance, surely?","250420":"I am so tired of pretending to care about you.","250421":"We are patently not on the same footing.","250427":"Take it. I hardly need it.","250428":"Had it coming out of my ears - wax free, of course.","250429":"Here is a token gift.","250435":"I'm here if ever you need a steady, albeit somewhat arthritic, hand to guide you.","250436":"Sir Archibald Blake, Her Majesty's moist mouthpiece!","250437":"One-piece underwear suits? Too prickly! I find singleton shorts and vests to be tried and true!","250438":"For once something you've done makes sense.","250439":"That's not a terrible idea.","250440":"Oh, yes...","250441":"Most promising.","250442":"Surprisingly shrewd ...","250443":"Vagabond!","250444":"Tatterdemalion!","250445":"A bold-faced swindle!","250446":"The impudence!","250447":"A low-life move.","250448":"By Jove, you're a maniac!","250449":"Your paper tigers will be blown to the winds.","250450":"War? All too obvious, you sneeze-lurking snake.","250451":"Finally worked out who's best?","250452":"I suppose I could spare you ...","250453":"I could have batty-fanged you to bits.","250454":"Yes, I do think you need time to recuperate.","250455":"Fine, though I doubt you have anything tradeworthy.","250456":"I keenly await your first shipment of soiled 'k'chiefs.","250457":"Trade with you? Lucky me.","250458":"No more of your junk? Say it's not true!","250459":"Finally we can be rid of your detritus!","250460":"Yes, go back to the foot of the pyramid.","250465":"Certainly I can be a friend, at least on paper.","250466":"Dry your eyes, I will be your ally.","250467":"Weaselling your way out?","250468":"Sloping your shoulders?","250475":"More money is always good.","250476":"Never look a gift donkey in the chops.","250479":"Weird and wonderful!","250482":"I'm sure ma'am shall be delighted!","250483":"Superlative!","250484":"Suitably regal!","250485":"Her Majesty might approve!","250486":"Comforting as a moist and springy sponge!","250487":"Well that certainly settles the stomach!","250489":"You're a credit to the Empire!","250490":"You're constant, and that is key!","250491":"Perhaps a peerage is on the cards?","250492":"Majesty will soon be mentioning you.","250493":"I knew you'd come through!","250494":"You're flourishing!","250495":"You're a national treasure!","250496":"Her Majesty will be discomfited…","250497":"There's an unpleasant waft in the air.","250498":"Heavens, what shall I tell her majesty?","250499":"Oh, horsefeathers.","250500":"This brings on my indigestion.","250501":"I'm suddenly hot under the collar.","250502":"Pshaw, I shan't sleep at all.","250503":"You put me in a difficult position…","250504":"I wouldn't wish to accuse you of disloyalty…","250505":"Perhaps think again on the situation?","250506":"I fear you've made things awkward…","250507":"Might I advise against your current course?","250508":"Now we don't want to have a contretemps.","250509":"It's not that we don't trust you entirely…","250511":"I present my humble duty to you, and am confident you'll transcend your present circumstance!","250512":"I am a humble servant of Her Majesty, called upon for delicate occasions such as these.","250513":"Taking the initiative - excellent!","250514":"What a jolly, jolly surprise.","250515":"Ah yes, the bright young sapling!","250516":"I present my humble duty to you.","250517":"Don't tell me I've missed another appointment?","250518":"Sir Archibald Blake, how may I serve?","250519":"Anyone for croquet?","250520":"I've always dreamed of being loathed!","250521":"Au contraire! There is nothing more in fashion than the monocle!","250522":"Your guttural babble sloshes like water off a duck's back!","250523":"The wayward jabs of your sabre are foiled by your lack of poise.","250524":"What sticky drippy honey goop!","250525":"Damn liberal! Control your peculiar thoughts!","250526":"What a fawning cod you have turned out to be.","250527":"Your toadyism is thoroughly nauseating!","250528":"Lies and slander! My wife died in a curricle accident!","250529":"I am nothing like my idiot father! You calumniating imp!","250530":"What's wrong with my moustache?!","250531":"Oh, yes. Couldn't have said it better myself.","250532":"Thank you! Pleasingly round isn't it?","250533":"Very true! They are extremely shiny.","250534":"I know your game of billiards, but don't let me stop you.","250538":"I'm glad of our trade, most are too dazzled by me to even approach.","250539":"I rarely circulate among minnows, yet we've done a few deals.","250540":"The little piglet that keeps coming back to the teat, its adorable.","250541":"We prepare for the worst but hope for the best.","250542":"Our humble little Empire.","250543":"The King is dead, long live the Queen!","250544":"The street layout was positively Byzantine until recent times.","250545":"I AM a real baron, I tell you!","250546":"Her Majesty's finest!","250547":"A lustrous jewel in the crown!","250548":"Every ship needs a stiff rudder!","250549":"An Empire covers both land AND sea!","250550":"Ma'am and I are much obliged!","250551":"A royal acknowledgement is due!","250552":"Sir Archibald gives his thanks.","250553":"Naturally!","250557":"But of course!","250559":"Oh, most assuredly!","250572":"I bought some of your island. The door was open, and I ambled through.","250573":"Hardly worth investing in your island, but then, it won't be yours for long.","250574":"A delicious morsel. Soon I shall have the lion's share.","250575":"It can be mine now. All mine.","250576":"I have so many grand plans for it…","250577":"A completely insignificant island, no wonder you're so keen to buy!","250578":"You can afford to tussle for my island? Perhaps I underestimated you.","250579":"Only a fastidious cove thinks they can buy their way in!","250580":"You think you've outmanoeuvred me!","250581":"Defraud me of an entire island?!","250582":"Sad you lack the acumen to see the potential of this land.","250583":"What kind of apple-polisher gives up an island?","250586":"You only have it because I let you have it!","250587":"You do the hard work developing it, and then I'll take it back.","250590":"You philistine! All my hard work gone from that island.","250591":"You erased every trace of von Malching from it?! Savage!","250592":"Razed every brick I laid? You are possessed by sadistic demons!","250593":"I fear that may be impossible.","250594":"The thought makes me wince!","250595":"Oh my aching organs, no.","250596":"As a boy, I was chased through the palace by a disgruntled goose, honking and hissing! I had its egg, you see. Once I'd given it back, the goose and I became firm friends.","250597":"Tolerance, sympathy, understanding. Supreme qualities in a monarch wishing for a happy reign.","250598":"Her Majesty rarely needs guidance - ah, a little here and there - I think she simply likes to have my company.","250599":"Ever carved a lovespoon from walnut? I did have an amour once, but matters of state drew us apart.","250600":"As Her Majesty's adjutant, I must be quietly attentive. The merest smile on her face is enough!","250601":"Viscount Guffington-Hawkmoth, wounded at his own estate. It brings to light Her Majesty's very present vulnerability.","250602":"Bless Her Majesty, she eats so fast, but when she stops, so must we!","250605":"Her Majesty's rare gift is a soft heart and a hard mind. With monarchs, it is too often the reverse!","250606":"Anne Harlow's fall from grace was stormy and unpleasant, a bit like my bowels.","250607":"George Smith has a marvellous walking cane of alder, with tasteful silver flourishes.","250608":"Aha...Jean La Fortune. We'd like to have helped, but it's rather gone beyond that now.","250609":"Isabel Sarmento? You should probably be careful where you speak that name.","250610":"Mr. Bleakworth may seem a blinkered horse, but is very well-suited to his task at the prison.","250611":"When running errands for Her Majesty, I often find myself in Madame Kahina's exquisite company.","250612":"Miss Jorgensen is a far relation of Her Majesty, if I'm not mistaken. They do both share a certain boldness...","250613":"We have made every conceivable dispensation for Princess Qing, as we are compelled to do with visiting royalty!","250614":"We auditioned this Wibblesock for Her Majesty's fifteenth birthday, sadly the rabbit didn't survive the hat.","250615":"Beryl O'Mara has flies on the wall, as I only dream our own discrete services might.","250616":"Her Majesty wearies of Mr. von Malching's pinguid claims to a non-existent barony.","250617":"I worry Artur Gasparov might one day appear at the palace better-dressed than her majesty.","250620":"I'll smithereen you!","250621":"Lowly cur!","250622":"Have at you, devil-dog!","250623":"I'm positively bristling!","250624":"I am suddenly violent!","250625":"You wild beast!","250626":"You vindictive menace!","250627":"Your fleet is a rabble!","250628":"Plebs are not at liberty to joust!","250629":"Knave!","250630":"Oh dear, did your stock plummet?","250631":"I shall sweep your wreck for treasure!","250632":"Your tin-pot tars left clinging to driftwood!","250633":"That ship cost me an arm and a leg!","250634":"My ship! You electric eel!","250635":"Where did you find such firepower?","250636":"I should have charged the spectators!","250637":"It gave way so easily!","250638":"Have you any idea how much that cost?","250639":"That will be sickeningly expensive to replace!","250640":"Look at my winning smile!","250641":"It's my island now. Time to exploit the dissidents!","250642":"Oh no. Looks like I've trampled over you on my way to the top of the pile.","250643":"Nowhere left to run for the von Malching line. Be my surrogate, show them all... how to run a cut-throat business.","250644":"They were a valued business associate!","250645":"Don't rub out my allies! They could be useful!","250646":"You take care of my enemies, and I'll make mountains.","250647":"Yes, you create a distraction while I fill my pockets.","250648":"I had you down as a lily-livered waif.","250649":"Rash. You almost have my respect.","250650":"A military gambit now?","250651":"Yes. Better to send your plebs to war.","250652":"I hear your officers call you 'pipsqueak'.","250653":"Playing tin soldiers?","250654":"You polish your blunderbuss like a pimpled cadet.","250655":"The bluster of a shoe-laced ruffian.","250656":"Honour our agreement, drive back these scoundrels!","250657":"You would not dare renege on our pact!?","250658":"Come at the drop of a hat? Only if I get a share of the spoils.","250659":"This feels like a first for me; honouring a deal I made.","250660":"Foxed your way into my hole!? Where's my rifle?","250661":"You'll soon be back here before a firing squad!","250662":"Enough meaningless talk, let's see how rich you are in a duel!","250663":"My slick sailors will string yours from their sails!","250664":"One fish in the vast school that will bring you to your patchwork knees!","250665":"These majestic cannons will shred your rag-tag sails.","250666":"Pure pleasure …","250667":"All in Her Majesty's name.","250668":"More flexible than you imagined!","250669":"The royal seal upon it!","250670":"I can finally let go that pent-up gas!","250671":"Customs and excise, eh!","250672":"Duty done, time for a kip!","250673":"Pull up your braces, and thrust into the unknown!","250674":"If you pop off now, you'll be back in time for tennis!","250675":"Know that any assistance may influence Her Majesty's sphere!","250676":"Alas, my bowels churn afresh and I must beg your expertise...","250677":"Now here is a vital matter, of Queen and country!","250678":"Brute force?! A fearful determination.","250679":"You didn't play fair! This wretched life is never fair.","250680":"Righty-ho!","250681":"Jolly Roger!","250682":"Buckaroo!","250683":"That really is first-rate.","250684":"I am quite penetrated by your kindness.","250685":"Bish-bang-bibbly, there she blows!","250686":"Ideally, one should keep one's promises.","250687":"Now, now. You oughtn't waste people's time.","250688":"Didn't finish? Ah. Um…hmmn…","250689":"Failed? I feel a ghastly surge coming on.","250690":"Caught trousers down? Happens to the best of us!","250708":"Her Majesty has little patience, I'd skip to it if I were you!","250709":"Have you heard the expression, 'a stitch in time saves nine' …","250710":"Resting? Perhaps you'd like my latest; male torso in rosewood!","250711":"Much has moved since we spoke, but I can still count on you?","250712":"I fear I must call upon you again, in spite of your good work.","250713":"I confess these unseemly troubles gurgle on, hope you don't mind?","250714":"Loyalty to the crown really should come above all else …","250715":"Only Her Majesty has your best interests at heart.","250988":"Perhaps it'll mean journeying to the centre of the earth!","250989":"I just know you'll give for a worthy cause!","250990":"There's fun to be found in everything, even quests!","250991":"Exploooooore this!","250992":"I feel better already!","250993":"You are too kind!","250994":"What can I say but thank you!","250995":"Upon my stars, I never doubted you!","250996":"The happiest possible thing!","250997":"The Jorgensen Trust couldn't be more grateful!","250998":"It's every person's right to change their mind!","250999":"A lost world! Oh well.","251000":"Next time will be more than perfect!","251001":"If the whole business is too much, just say!","251002":"We should never give up, even when things are really bad!","251003":"Don't worry, I know you have a fine conscience!","251004":"I know which summit we can scale next!","251005":"Such sublime co-operation merits further exploration!","251006":"So many more miracles to be weaved!","251007":"There's always another way!","251008":"It's so nice to have a choice!","251009":"A new world!? I will turn every stone in every stream!","251010":"Oh yes pick me!

Why am I so nice, when I should have been selfish, and cut off your head?","252045":"You could have talked things through…","252046":"Do you have no regard for life?","252047":"Still a tragedy, though we never saw eye-to-eye.","252048":"I still wouldn't wish that on anyone.","252049":"You want to protect what is dear to you.","252050":"Most species have some form of defence.","252051":"Back against the wall, I might do the same.","252052":"It is instinct to want to shield our families.","252053":"Embrace it.","252054":"Open your eyes.","252055":"Touch the other side.","252056":"Give yourself up.","252057":"I will break you…","252058":"I am fear…","252059":"Obey your master…","252060":"Kneel, dog.","252061":"It's harvest time…","252062":"I'm setting you free.","252063":"Let's look back on the exquisiteness of war.","252064":"I can only pray the carnage will resume soon.","252065":"Our trade bodies intersect.","252066":"I crave your firkins.","252067":"See saw Margery Daw, Jacky shall have a new master…","252068":"I tire of this busy-work.","252069":"I've already cut my palm for you …","252070":"I hope you don't end up feeling detached.","252071":"Now the money is disgorged, you keep it.","252072":"A token of my affection.","252075":"I'm sure you have reasons.","252076":"The advisory board is impressed by your might.","252077":"I didn't know you liked fighting.","252078":"I try not to think about conflict.","252079":"Help, I have declared war on your ally!

I'm intrigued.","252108":"Temptation.","252109":"Gratifying.","252110":"It soothes…","252111":"A real thrill.","252112":"Pigcrap.","252113":"Excremental.","252114":"Your tiny mind!","252115":"Out of your box!","252116":"To destroy me, you must destroy yourself. Can you do that?","252117":"Your end can be your beginning.","252118":"Perhaps you are unready for the final ritual.","252119":"You want it drawn out? By all means.","252120":"Yes, why not share an artery?","252121":"Ah, the venial sin of currency!","252122":"Do keep in touch.","252123":"Oh. Was my handshake a little firm?","252125":"I really hope I can make you see differently.","252126":"Don't stop, let red rage overflow your cup!","252128":"Money is a sad reality.","252130":"Oh pigcrap, you can do better than that.","252131":"I find all living things beautiful, except parasites.","252132":"Deserter?! Humanity is a desert. A clutch of hollow skulls between the dunes of entropy.","252133":"Your words make me wonder, are you the one the omens said would come?","252135":"How I crave the rush of our every exchange!","252136":"Frankly that sounds delicious. Please, go on...","252137":"Is that your diagnosis doctor? Are you going to give me my medicine now?","252138":"Is this praise? I'm confused. It sounds like praise.","252139":"You know, you grovel at the perfect height for a passing hammer...","252140":"If you were that devoted, you'd have graced my shrine with an offering - any cut will do.","252141":"Another came before you, bearing pineapples. But he enjoyed them more than I did.","252142":"That was before my metamorphosis - a name dead to me!","252143":"Did I ever tell you about the time I turned a man inside-out?","252144":"Please, that is a word I don't like. I beg you, call us pigs.","252145":"Not all my mites are so fervent. I will keep a wedge of flesh back for you.","252146":"How enlightened, at least as much as pigcrap humans can be.","252147":"That does sound like my work...and lice you say? Just wonderful.","252150":"I like the way you scuttle in and out with your trade ships.","252151":"I should turn these tables, and flay you from my temple.","252156":"I'll gently harvest the wheatfields of your soul.","252157":"I will feast upon this body of land…","252158":"While you barter for a strip of my skin, I'm out in the woods looking for a rug.","252159":"If you eat it from the inside out, I may reciprocate.","252160":"Pigcrap let me have the island, believes anything I say.","252162":"Settling like a butterfly? I have a great passion for lepidoptera.","252164":"All I made upon that island removed. Admirable conviction.","252177":"Greed, pure greed; it has a vice-like grip.","252178":"Funny how a few flaxen discs confer such absurd power.","252179":"It will be a nice new playground…","252180":"Money is soaked in bloody fingerprints, remember that.","252181":"La Corona tried to buy me out. I burst their bubble.","252182":"That island is very precious to me.","252183":"With your blessing, anything I do here will feel legitimate now.","252185":"Sad to see the place go. So many happy memories.","252187":"Cleansed all trace of me? You are made in my own image.","252188":"All trace of me expunged from your island, how liberating.","252189":"I crush you like velvet.","252190":"Your violence sustains me!","252191":"Drowning is always a favourite.","252192":"You animal!","252193":"Let's watch it crumble together!","252194":"Yes, give in to your thirst for destruction!","252195":"It's for the best. Your island was going nowhere.","252196":"Look into my eyes. I want to see the light fade before I harvest your husk.","252197":"Regrets? I wish I had done more cooking; I always had the temperament of a chef.","252198":"Killing my ally cannot hurt me, no.","252199":"I would like to see the body, if it is still all in one place.","252200":"What is life without death?","252201":"Don't fight, it's pointless. You are pointless.","252202":"I know on some occasion we agreed that together, we'd feast on their offal.","252203":"A puppy chases your sheep, so you call a wolf for help!","252204":"Please, erase me. Tear down my wickednesses.","252205":"They are hungry; I rubbed their noses in your scent.","252206":"What brutality, if I may say so.","252208":"I caress destruction.","252209":"Satisfy my thirst.","252210":"Humans are so ugly!","252211":"Fire and brimstone!","252212":"Hurt me, I deserve it.","252213":"Feed me!","252214":"Balm me with your animus.","252215":"Nourish me!","252216":"Like Atlantis, sunk to the deep.","252217":"Kneel before Poseidon.","252218":"Yes, drown my pathetic sailors!","252219":"It's a mercy for them, the incompetents.","252220":"I sweep it away like gingerbread!","252221":"Destroy! You were born to destroy!","252222":"Your island is free now.","252223":"Take it, you've earned it. I'll get you back later.","252224":"I have no need of friends. Kill them.","252225":"I almost regret seeing the bad ones find release.","252226":"Let fury engulf your mortal vessel!","252227":"Let terror lead you to deliverance.","252228":"Unshackle your mind, and swing its chains.","252229":"Pigcrap, your forces are fat to be rendered.","252230":"Why don't you save your effort for the end.","252231":"I know you're keen, but it's not time yet.","252232":"Our bodies shall fuse violently, pigcrap, against those wretches.","252233":"But of course I'll join you; we are bound to the covenant.","252234":"Topple this Babel. I have been proud and must be punished.","252235":"I see visions of white walls misted red with blood.","252236":"Finally it's getting exciting. I'm so thrilled you can be taken apart.","252237":"BOOOOOOM!","252266":"It's all prepared.","252267":"A check copy?","252268":"I feel it reflects the times.","252269":"I'm confident it's ready to go.","252270":"I could simply go to press?","252271":"One final look?","252272":"Not too many changes, I hope?","252273":"It's out of my hands now...","252274":"We had to go to press...","252275":"I wouldn't worry, most only look at the pictures.","252276":"Uncompromising journalism!","252277":"No changes? Really?!","252278":"It's important to be true to oneself.","252279":"Censorship is not always the cranny of the corrupt!","252280":"Of course, you know what's best.","252281":"Anything else? Then I'll send it out.","252288":"I may well be the foremost visionary of any era.","252289":"What column would I be? Good question: perhaps a Doric-Ionic composite of chryselephantine.","252290":"I am an earthbound demi-god.

you, let's not fight!","256442":"I don't need a quarrel with you.","256443":"If I had to back a cockerel, it might be you.","256444":"We don't have to live at odds.","256445":"I'm not going to say I trust you.","256446":"Do I really have conviction in you?","256447":"Something about you still gives my people hope.","256448":"Dealing with you could be a lottery.","256449":"Little fish are careful who they swim with.","256450":"Don't trust me?!

Shall I vent it?","256628":"You're in bloom. Where are my secateurs…","256629":"Heads above the parapet get lopped.","256637":"You defile land special to me.","256638":"Trespassers in the sacred lands must be eaten.","256639":"Don't stretch yourself too thin.","256643":"Sail full of wind, no rudder in sight.","256644":"Advance with caution.","256645":"Hearing about your achievements bores me to tears.","256648":"Change takes bold leadership.","256649":"You've stolen a march on our enemies.","256650":"Routine progress through the ranks.","256653":"Rash, don't you think?","256654":"What are you building, an empire?!","256655":"You'll soon know the difference between quality and quantity.","256656":"Thirst for conquest; one of my indulgences.","256657":"Strategic expansion, centralised power.","256658":"Difficult terrain - I'm impressed.","256659":"Oh yes, forget about silly old us!","256660":"Your people seem so sophisticated!","256661":"We're happy to be left behind!","256664":"Yes, don't trail behind me out of politeness!","256665":"Your people have great potential!","256666":"You'll be advancing again in no time!","256669":"Now you've got more islands than me!","256670":"I suppose expansion is always good.","256671":"Amazing you know what to do with them all.","256672":"You'll be spreading out again in no time, I'm sure!","256673":"See, a whole world waits for us to explore!","256674":"That's it old bean, spread out!","256682":"Oh dear, lost your flagship?

What of it...?","258497":"We usually meet by the light of the moon.","258498":"That just makes you fair game again, right boys?","258499":"Whatsay we come for your goods just the same?","258500":"Makes no odds to us how you want to be stung.","258501":"A fellow outcast eh? I'll be the judge of that.","258502":"Ye'll never last with ol' Annie.","258503":"I knew you wouldn't stick it with us for long.","258504":"We prefer our own company anyway.","258508":"None of that pity, just the laying down of arms.","258509":"I don't expect you'll show mercy.","258510":"Trade us in, and we'll box you good and proper.","258511":"We pirates have special terms.","258512":"Willing to pay the price?","258513":"From now on, you'll stay away, d'yer hear?","258514":"Deal with my men again and I'll cut you a smile.","258515":"Haven't you heard? Pirates never barter!","258516":"Not 'cos we want to, 'cos we have to.","258517":"On one condition; you're still not a pirate.","258518":"Finally got you off our backs.","258519":"Good news, we don't need you any more.","258520":"Don't think you'll be getting any more.","258521":"This is an exception!","258522":"We'll have it back soon enough.","258523":"Don't waste yer effort, we're dead already.","258524":"Then a tiny independent nation rises proudly above the sea of injustice.","258525":"I'd gamble on me too, there's a bet I know I can't lose.","258526":"Then the die is cast. Our people have everything to fight for.","258527":"Better keep a poker face.","258528":"Bondye Bon.","258529":"The odds are in our favour.","258530":"Shows we're right to be persistent.","258531":"These moments are almost worth the struggle.","258532":"Something good to tell my little girl.","258533":"Bull's eye.","258534":"Don't waste that acumen of yours.","258535":"You might be bona fide after all.","258536":"You're good!","258537":"Look at you swagger!","258538":"I know you must be a libertarian deep down.","258539":"It's easy to get drawn in by you.","258540":"Are you finally embracing a just cause?","258541":"Things are hard enough as it is!","258542":"What am I going to tell my wife and daughter?","258543":"We don't need any more misfortune!","258544":"We just going to have to endure this.","258545":"Some hands you have to live with.","258546":"We're not ones to fold, no matter what!","258547":"Only a coward would give in now.","258548":"I don't think you're genuine.","258549":"You know, I scarcely need agitating.","258550":"So snake eyes, is that how it is?","258551":"Always did have you down as a despot.","258552":"What have you done?!","258553":"I'd hate to punish you, but if that's what it takes.","258554":"I've tried everything with you…","258555":"Thank the Almighty.","258556":"I'm grateful.","258557":"Lord knows we needed it.","258558":"As you wish.","258559":"Wi.","258560":"We're fine with it.","258561":"Non.","258562":"No dice.","258563":"When chicks teethe.","258570":"Let's both take a step back for a moment.","258571":"Some of us need time to regroup!","258572":"Oh, are we still fighting?","258573":"This should be a land of free and fair trade.","258574":"You can't afford to miss opportunities here.","258575":"We will be a respected trading nation like the rest.","258576":"Our terms of trade were a joke from the beginning.","258577":"There's no benefit to us in working with you.","258578":"We've got our own economy now.","258579":"No need for animosity, why don't we help each other?","258580":"I promise not to back out at the crucial moment.","258581":"I don't think you have my people's interests at heart.","258582":"You know, we do pretty well on our own.","258583":"A token of my people's good will.","258584":"Share and share alike, I say.","258585":"What can I say, I'm the giving type.","258587":"You're right, we need some perspective.","258588":"I also have my wife and children to think about.","258589":"Of course, we're always interested in commerce.","258590":"Well why wouldn't you trade with us?","258591":"What could possibly go wrong!","258592":"It's ok, we don't have to deal.","258593":"Strike out alone, I won't be a hypocrite.","258594":"Maybe its better we do our own thing.","258595":"I look forward to working with you.","258596":"An alliance built to last.","258597":"We all have our reasons, don't let me stop you.","258598":"No need to apologise, I understand.","259748":"To work with the lowest, yet answer only to God and the Queen. How many can say that?","259749":"Surely the choice is black and white, what with my clean record executing justice.","259750":"It's not my job to know their crimes, only to find a fitting punishment.","259751":"Everything seems in order.","259752":"I see no crime in this.","259753":"All running like clockwork.","259754":"Duty has its rewards.","259755":"A break from hard labour.","259756":"A light through the bars!","259757":"No less than is deserved.","259758":"Excellent.","259759":"Whatever your methods, you hide them well.","259760":"You run a tight ship.","259761":"I attest to your probity.","259762":"You execute well.","259763":"Your techniques are efficient.","259764":"Exemplary conduct.","259765":"This warrants an inquiry!","259766":"Someone will hang for this.","259767":"Criminal.","259768":"Never would have passed on my watch.","259769":"Everything, everyone, is suspect.","259770":"I will raise an injunction!","259771":"It's misery by proxy.","259772":"Your negligence is criminal.","259773":"Careful you don't end up on my island.","259774":"So you were the perpetrator!","259775":"If you aren't with me, villain…","259776":"You tread a very thin line.","259777":"Fall foul of me, and fall foul of sovereign law.","259778":"Don't expect to get off scot-free.","259779":"Justice served.","259780":"Community service is it?","259781":"That's the least I'm due for my suffering.","259782":"If we must.","259783":"I permit it.","259784":"Seems legitimate.","259787":"Not interested.","259788":"Nix to it!","259789":"I'm going to have to shut it off.","259791":"If you're after something unique, you can expect to pay for it.","259792":"The Emporium Exotique doesn't open its doors to just anyone you know.","259793":"You're looking for something, and I can help you find it.","259794":"Isn't that a curiosity.","259795":"Intriguing.","259796":"What an exciting turn.","259797":"This is turning into quite a story.","259798":"Exhilarating.","259799":"So, the secret's out.","259800":"A good outcome.","259801":"Maybe I was wrong about you.","259802":"You've got my attention.","259803":"What a killer instinct.","259804":"There's merchant in you.","259805":"You can be quite cutthroat.","259806":"You've rocked the apple cart.","259807":"I like the way you set out your stall.","259808":"What a surprise.","259809":"Just as expected.","259810":"And life once seemed so thrilling.","259811":"Typical.","259812":"What a tangle.","259813":"I anticipated that.","259814":"Disappointing.","259815":"You'll have to do better than that.","259816":"That's your best offer?","259817":"Are you wasting my time?","259818":"You need to be more ruthless.","259819":"Not much in the way of business sense.","259820":"I've seen some stupid things…","259821":"Oh you're not another one of those…","259822":"Maybe I shouldn't insist on working alone.","259823":"I'm grateful but I won't lower my prices.","259824":"This favour will repay itself in other ways.","259825":"Interesting, very well.","259826":"Sounds tempting enough.","259827":"Agreed.","259828":"I'm not interested.","259829":"My days of risk-taking are over.","259830":"I might have agreed to that once, not any more.","259831":"Of course we will take a stand beside you, if you are for freedom and justice!","259832":"Now is the time for choosing sides. Just or unjust.","259833":"We join on one condition, that like you we are free to write our own history.","259834":"We can build on this.","259835":"It is good news.","259836":"Let's take nothing for granted.","259837":"This is progress at least.","259838":"We are all the stronger for this.","259839":"A small win, but we'll take it.","259840":"A flicker of hope.","259841":"Champion of the underdog!","259842":"I wanted to believe you'd come through.","259843":"It takes courage to make a stand.","259844":"I was right to trust you.","259845":"Your heart is in the right place.","259846":"You have achieved a lot.","259847":"May there be more good news from you.","259848":"It is only a setback.","259849":"We will come back stronger.","259850":"Nothing we aren't ready for.","259851":"We can't give up.","259852":"This cannot be allowed to harm our plans.","259853":"We can find a way around this.","259854":"We've seen worse.","259855":"You should have more faith.","259856":"Are you crazy?","259857":"I thought we had trust.","259858":"You will expose us.","259859":"I don't want to cut ties with you.","259860":"Ask youself, whose side are you on?","259861":"Don't burn all your bridges.","259862":"We won't forget this.","259863":"I am so happy someone could help us.","259864":"Words can't express how grateful we are.","259865":"We could use a distraction.","259866":"We can make it work.","259867":"It is a risk worth taking.","259868":"There must be a better way.","259869":"There is no time for this.","259870":"This will not help our struggle.","259872":"It makes one feel frisky and alive!","259873":"We ARE amused!","259874":"This suits us very well.","259875":"How wonderful to have it our own way!","259876":"How mischievous one feels!","259877":"It has all gone off very satisfactorily!","259878":"All is much as it should be.","259879":"Be strong in business, and become a pillar of our nation.","259880":"You continue to be of the greatest use to us.","259881":"Your successes must be a source of pride.","259882":"We appreciate your efforts.","259883":"Parliament commends you exceedingly.","259884":"You slide easily about the board like the rook!","259885":"You are a very able servant of the realm.","259886":"We are not amused!","259887":"The Queen regrets this distressing affair.","259888":"Another Queen may have turned to execution by now.","259889":"It is gravely injurious to our nation.","259890":"One wants prompt action against such outrage.","259891":"It is a time of discord for those of my station.","259892":"One of the many threats to my position.","259893":"The Queen finds your conduct inexcusable!","259894":"My father would have had you executed!","259895":"You WILL do better!","259896":"What a perilously selfish subject you are!","259897":"Your Queen is displeased with you.","259898":"Parliament will discuss what shall be done with you.","259899":"Tantamount to treason!","259900":"Then we owe our gratitude.","259901":"It is much admired.","259902":"Sincere thanks for attending to this matter.","259903":"It would be prudent to accept.","259904":"Oh, we are only too happy to agree.","259905":"We shall be delighted.","259906":"Shame Queens can't chop heads anymore.","259907":"Heaven forbid!","259908":"If that is a joke, it is not a funny one.","259909":"Yer a canny herring!","259910":"Yer know the ropes!","259911":"The crew come 'round to you.","259912":"Kelpie-blood in yer veins!","259913":"I know a sea-soul when I see one!","259914":"All at sea!","259915":"Years at sea, never sank this low.","259916":"May as well be sunk!","259917":"A most uneven keel!","259918":"The worst things happen at sea!","259919":"Yer aff yer head!","259920":"Drag us down with yer, eh?!","259921":"You'd have us piss in the wind!","259922":"You seem a loose cannon.","259923":"I won't say 'mutiny', Admiral.","259924":"I'll steer ye from here to the precipice, the edge of the world!","259925":"I'll cap'n for ye, til blood boil or freeze in my veins.","259928":"Pumping pistons!","259929":"No flies on me.","259930":"I'm over the moon.","259931":"I'm lighter than air.","259932":"I'd be blown away, if not for me ropes…","259933":"Whizbang!","259934":"Soaring like a buzzard.","259935":"You're flying!","259936":"Self-propelled, I see.","259937":"You make silk purses from sow's ears.","259938":"Sift and you will find.","259939":"You've got a spark.","259940":"Something always drops from the pipe with you.","259941":"Rubbish!","259942":"Fly-blown frass!","259943":"It unhinges me!","259944":"Soiled my day.","259945":"Bahhh!","259946":"Hollow piles o' dung.","259947":"I haven't time for this!","259948":"You're dynamite!","259949":"You're cranking my crank.","259950":"Don't ratchet me temper!","259951":"I'll 'ave yer bones!","259952":"I've a bone to pick with you.","259953":"Yer damp and dirty drape.","259954":"Yer smudge-pot.","259955":"Oily little toerag.","259956":"How touching.","259957":"I'm a grateful sackful.","259958":"Tinker very much.","259959":"I'm in.","259960":"Could be worse I s'pose.","259961":"Then what we waitin' for, let's get stuck in.","259962":"I won't be manipulated.","259963":"What's in it for me?","259964":"Gorr, take me for an idiot?","259965":"Where are my charts?","259966":"Preparation!","259967":"It's sextant time.","259968":"Let's extend the old telescope.","259969":"Time to rummage in the old sea chest.","259970":"Thank the Admiral.","259971":"Takes a lot to sway an old dog.","259972":"Me heart swells like the surf.","259973":"Aye, aye!","259974":"If the Admiral commands it!","259975":"Full steam ahead.","259976":"So be it!","259977":"Make it so!","259978":"As sure as the tide.","259979":"We do as commanded.","259980":"That we shall!","259981":"Nay, I cannae!","259982":"Enough, no more!","259983":"Damned if I will!","259984":"And all because of me.","259985":"And I was always so overlooked!","259986":"Not everyone is born for success.","259987":"They must now see it was I who turned out best.","259988":"I was always the dutiful child, the good child.","259989":"Finally, after all I've suffered.","259990":"Proof I should have been the one chosen.","259991":"You'll never be special, you know.","259992":"Heavens, you think this makes you a Goode?","259993":"Helpful or not, your presence is unwelcome.","259994":"Nothing you do will lift the cloud.","259995":"It's the least you could do.","259996":"Your father would be proud.","259997":"Perhaps now you'll leave me in peace e'gad.","259998":"Things never go without a hiccup, do they?!","259999":"This is folly!","260000":"Every time I have to play second fiddle!","260001":"What is the meaning of this!?","260002":"Why do I deserve to suffer!","260003":"It was agreed this matter would be settled!","260004":"I am more than capable of dealing with this!","260005":"Isn't it obvious? Everything is your fault.","260006":"Our family should have disowned you long ago.","260007":"Why couldn't you stay away?","260008":"This is all your doing.","260009":"Wastrel.","260010":"You always were a disappointment.","260011":"You have no inkling of this business!","260012":"Don't expect gratitude.","260013":"Oh thank heaven.","260014":"Sweet mercy.","260015":"See, I'm not afraid to take a calculated risk.","260016":"Why would there be a problem?","260017":"Why should I have compunctions about it?","260018":"I have decided otherwise!","260019":"Don't tell me what to do!","260020":"There will be no negotiation!","260021":"You do have a ship, Admiral?","260022":"Perhaps some form of sea craft?","260023":"We'll need the finest ship!","260024":"Where is she, let me see her!","260025":"What have yer christened her?","260026":"Something to keep us going, Admiral?","260027":"No provisions?!","260028":"On biscuit alone?","260029":"What of supplies?","260030":"I'd take anything I could just now.","260031":"Isn't she running a little light?!","260032":"We'll be taking a chance, Admiral.","260033":"I don't know if she's up to this!","260034":"Better hope she has spirit.","260035":"We'll have to take your word.","260036":"I suppose she'll do.","260037":"Not the worst manifest.","260038":"We're adequately stocked.","260039":"She's set fair enough.","260040":"I can't make any promises.","260041":"Ready as she'll ever be!","260042":"She's an honour to command, Admiral.","260043":"Rigged to succeed.","260044":"She's beautifully fitted.","260045":"Stacked in our favour.","260046":"Nothing to fear.","260048":"I am somewhat heartened.","260052":"High spirits.","260053":"Ready for anything.","260054":"Wind's in our sails","260055":"It'll be a breeze!","260056":"Plain sailing!","260057":"Seen better odds, and worse.","260058":"How many lives have we left?","260059":"I am more hopeful than I was.","260060":"All seems well for now.","260061":"Signs are more encouraging.","260062":"Times must be good.","260063":"I shouldn't complain at times like these.","260064":"All quite bearable.","260065":"I wouldn't like to wager.","260066":"Stick or twist?","260067":"It's your call, Admiral.","260068":"Only fate truly knows.","260069":"Only the wind can say.","260070":"Put more skulls on the pile?","260071":"A sword hangs above us.","260072":"Turn about, before it's too late.","260073":"All I can do is to warn you.","260074":"If doom it must be, we will follow.","260075":"I'm happy for you, really I am.","260076":"You might feel rather pleased with yourself.","260077":"You've kept things in good order.","260078":"No-one can begrudge your achievements.","260079":"You have not been unsuccessful!","260080":"Your dedication is commendable.","260081":"You work with reassuring method.","260082":"This grim monotony is worse than life.","260083":"I should like to be someone else.","260084":"Sigh...","260085":"I find this all so trivial.","260086":"How dull.","260087":"I want to feel something, just not irritable!","260088":"I'm tired of being tired.","260089":"You give me no comfort at present.","260090":"I worried you might be this sort of person.","260091":"You forget yourself.","260092":"A quaint interpretation of precision.","260093":"When you overlook minutiaie, things go awry.","260094":"And it's all the harder when one is alone!","260095":"It's a disordered tangle of briar.","260096":"What luxury!","260097":"Most cordial!","260098":"We feel most welcome","260099":"What a breath of fresh air.","260100":"How agreeable.","260101":"You inspire something in me.","260102":"Courteous from the moment we arrived.","260103":"Aren't you most accommodating.","260104":"You make for a charming host.","260105":"People must look up to you greatly.","260106":"This is not what was promised.","260107":"This is not as advertised!","260108":"The brochure was misleading!","260109":"We paid an awful lot to come here.","260110":"I may just catch the next boat home.","260111":"What a way for you to treat a guest.","260112":"You are a monstrous host.","260113":"Are you the manager?!","260114":"Are you responsible for this predicament?","260115":"You make things extraordinarily inconvenient!","260116":"I've finally arrived! Now to see if the journey was worth it.","260117":"Finally terra firma! I cannot wait to look around and explore.","260118":"Lovely day for seafront perambulation!","260119":"I'm writing a postcard - Ahem - just need someone to deliver it?","260120":"My portmanteau has spilled out everywhere!","260121":"Oh! Do you have a luncheon recommendation?","260122":"Good thing you caught me, we are about to take tea!","260128":"And at no additional cost?","260129":"What an unexpected treat!","260130":"Oh, much obliged!","260131":"When in Rome!","260132":"Happy to take that route.","260133":"Just the ticket!","260139":"Putting the first foot out of the door was the best decision I've ever made.","260140":"With so much out there to see, one has little time for homesickness, though I do keep pictures in my locket.","260141":"Certain gentlemen might recoil seeing ladies travel alone, but that is well, if recoiled they remain.","260142":"I notice that from altitude, it appears rather like an immense toy city!","260143":"Were the world a book, most wouldn't pass the foreword. Shame, because chapter one is just about the juiciest.","260144":"How about a parambrella, for rain or shine? Goodness knows how I could use such a thing.","260148":"We have a very fixed itinerary.","260149":"That's not in the handbook!","260150":"I won't be led from the beaten path!","260151":"Purge the filth of ego inside yourself!","260152":"You are that carefree?","260153":"Want to be a hero? Try being a human first.","260154":"Get a grip on your destiny.","260155":"I know you. This isn't you.","260156":"If you seek heaven, you have far to go.","260157":"If you go down, I'll go down with you.","260158":"I'd rather be stuck at sea.","260159":"Monsoons of bad feeling!","260160":"Dreadful.","260161":"God hates us.","260162":"Miserable.","260163":"No-one deserves this.","260164":"Why are we even here?","260165":"For once you have my respect, old pal.","260166":"You've come a long way.","260167":"You bust the world open like ripe fruit.","260168":"Good fire-breather! Thaw this frozen wasteland.","260169":"Conquer your mind, conquer the world.","260170":"You do your family honour.","260171":"Milk the willing cow!","260172":"Sweet nectar.","260173":"Cascades of good feeling.","260174":"We are blessed.","260175":"No sun, but somehow all rosy.","260176":"Better than being at sea.","260177":"God loves us.","260178":"Perfection is close.","260179":"Ah old pal, it's been a while since we adventured together.","260180":"I've been waiting for your call, old pal, wherever you go I will follow.","260181":"I'm behind you, even if no-one else is.","260182":"I feel you need my capital.","260183":"I invest in upstanding people.","260184":"Any takeover would be done ethically.","260185":"Takeovers should be founded on strong principles…","260186":"Don't you cut in, you slippery fish.","260187":"This island's not about money, it's about people.","260188":"If you want to buy into my island, you buy into my ideas.","260189":"People who just take and take til there's nothing left...","260190":"Those people will never go willingly. (moral threat)","260191":"I'm grateful my claim has been settled amicably.","260192":"You've given these people prospects, I ought to thank you.","260193":"I see you trampled every forward step I made there.","260194":"You can crush everything on that island but its soul.","260195":"I admire your transparency of conduct over the island.","260196":"The acquisition was an honourable one.","260197":"Only a heathen would try to overwrite history.","260198":"The trick is to invest in the right people.","260199":"Let old Beryl take a slice.","260200":"I like to have a finger in every pie.","260201":"Well I haven't snatched it just yet!","260202":"Islands, fame, a bit of money can buy anything.","260203":"Are you sure you want to be part of me mob?","260204":"I know what you're after, and I can't let you have it.","260205":"Ah, so you want to play that game?","260206":"My island. Don't get any funny ideas.","260207":"Take it! I'll still be there in one way or toher!","260208":"Beryl wouldn't want to take it behind yer back, now.","260209":"Nice to make a legitimate acquisition.","260210":"You can pull the strings there now.","260211":"As far as you know it's all yours.","260212":"Who cares about the past, I like to live in the present.","260213":"Everything changes, it's yer one guarantee in life.","260214":"I'd have made a clean break too.","260215":"And my critics say I don't take enough risks.","260216":"I can appreciate the art of others.","260217":"My therapist says money matters dominate middle age.","260218":"I'll make sure it has a smooth finish.","260219":"Maybe losing your island will polish you off?","260220":"Don't lurk as if I am somehow past it!","260221":"What? Not even I can afford one of my pieces!","260222":"I firmly believe art should be shared by all.","260223":"You will never fully appreciate it!","260224":"You will turn majesty into a monstrosity.","260225":"Even a featureless desert can be Eden in the right hands.","260226":"This island is clay, and I am its sculptor.","260227":"An island with too many rough edges.","260228":"A chinless island. I won't work with such materials!","260229":"You cannot rewrite the history of art!","260230":"This is the desecration of all human culture!","260231":"Such vandalism weighs heavier than a thousand lives!","260232":"Perhaps a change of fortunes.","260233":"Well, I shan't be an ingrate.","260234":"A thank you is probably in order.","260235":"Oh what does it matter either way...","260236":"What else can I do but accept...","260237":"Then it shall be so...","260238":"No indeed!","260239":"I can't let it happen.","260240":"Really this is too much.","260241":"Thank the high one.","260242":"This is a blessing.","260243":"Divine succour!","260244":"Of course.","260245":"Odd, but good.","260246":"Curious. I accept.","260247":"Hush your mouth!","260248":"Why should I!?","260249":"I will not!","260250":"A good leader uses every weapon at their disposal.","260252":"As you see I've never struggled for money.","260253":"As you see, the family wealth is considerable.","260254":"How peculiar to insist we wait at port. Is something the matter?","260255":"This island needs proper leadership…","260256":"Be honest, the responsibility is too much for you.","260257":"Only empires can assimilate!","260258":"I never agreed you could be a shareholder!","260259":"Every man and his dog has money these days.","260260":"This island is crucial, you'll ruin everything!","260261":"You can't just go waltzing in!","260262":"I'm glad you gave it up without a fight.","260263":"Thanks for giving me a view of the battlefield.","260264":"An insignificant little acreage.","260265":"I only care for strategic outposts.","260266":"Pillage marks the depraved, and the doomed.","260267":"Those who go too far always regret it.","260268":"The complete debellation of my legacy.","260269":"This city is a magnet for genius.","260270":"We're in the presence of a virtuoso!","260271":"How thrilling! A renowned personage has arrived!","260272":"I shall be a trustee.","260273":"I hope I can gradually seed change.","260274":"All my life savings.","260275":"Of course, nobody wants you to lose your island...","260276":"There comes a time when we must make way for something better.","260277":"To share in reward, you must share in pain.","260278":"Meddlesome little...","260279":"Silver will not save you.","260280":"I will not rest until it is returned to me.","260281":"It will be difficult to forgive you this act of treachery!","260282":"It's good to see you are compliant.","260283":"A modest retreat to partake in my hobbies.","260284":"The secret may be out about this place.","260285":"Enjoy life there while you may.","260286":"You seize the day, and I'll wait for night.","260287":"The forest shall soon grow again, darker and denser.","260288":"I remember what was there, don't you fret.","260289":"Even if the place is changed, the memory remains most powerful.","260290":"A surge of interest here this season.","260291":"Always hard to keep places under one's hat.","260292":"An ever-more popular site for we pilgrims.","260293":"Coming into fashion as a destination.","260294":"Where interest wanes, there will be a reason.","260295":"Numbers seem to have dropped off.","260296":"Perhaps they're going to prettier places.","260297":"That there are fewer of us should tell you something.","260298":"Visitors are falling away.","260299":"No more or less popular than before.","260300":"Our cruise was just as full as last time.","260301":"I'm glad, at least, it is not any busier.","260302":"I see the same faces whenever I come here.","260303":"Same old holiday gang as last time.","260317":"A sensation!","260318":"Everything seems up-to-the-minute!","260319":"Oh to exit these rat tubes!","260320":"I would lick spittle for you, governor.","260321":"You teach us endlessly.","260322":"In the headlines for all the right reasons.","260323":"You are more than a silent observer.","260324":"A scandal!","260325":"Black, white, and red all over!","260326":"No, drag me through the mud.","260327":"Nothing will make me leave your side.","260328":"You do keep us on our toes...","260329":"Ignore my miserable-type face.","260330":"Left to rot with last year's pumpkins!","260331":"The place is a bloomin' hole!","260332":"We've been hung out to dry!","260333":"What a dung heap.","260334":"Rather drown in slurry, than live 'ere.","260335":"This is the last straw!","260336":"I won't 'ave my babbies in squalor!","260337":"It's a filthy pigsty!","260338":"We're livin' hand-to-mouth.","260339":"It's harrowin' livin' 'ere.","260340":"We've been lured to a vile shanty-town!","260341":"I'd rather stand behind an elephant than ever return!","260342":"I will see these slums in my nightmares.","260343":"This city is a house of horrors!","260344":"A bit municipal isn't it?","260345":"It lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.","260346":"It's everything they said it would be.","260347":"I shall remember these fine edifices for some time.","260348":"I'm in love with this living watercolour!","260349":"It's peculiar here.","260350":"What do I see here? Little piles of dog lime.","260351":"This might be a once-in-a-lifetime trip.","260352":"As a centre, it is the palest shade of mediocre.","260353":"Pleasant, despite the odd pickpocket.","260354":"I think we've seen everything there is to see.","260355":"Good, but nothing to write home about.","260356":"It's nice, though the sand is too yellow.","260357":"There's a satisfying amount to enjoy.","260358":"My impression is in the main, positive.","260359":"The streets and buildings are arranged nicely.","260360":"I have no regrets about coming here.","260361":"One wonders at the genius who built all this.","260362":"What romance dwells in these streets!","260363":"It is no façade, the charms of this city are real!","260364":"So many magnificent vistas, I've lost count.","260365":"A paradise! The pleasantest conceivable bubble!","260366":"Coming here has changed my life forever.","260367":"A city of angels, streets paved with gold!","260368":"Please tell me this visit shall never be over!","260369":"Can I interest you in this recently-polished apple?","260370":"The idiot is back. Oh heavens I...I thought you were the photographer.","260371":"We feel safe!","260372":"Barely noticed there's a war on.","260373":"There's a war, apparently.","260374":"Sounds like you need a few scarecrows.","260375":"Keep them foreign rabbits off our lettuce!","260376":"The enemy's clutching at straws.","260383":"I found a sheep skull, is it a sign?","260384":"Our way o' life's under threat.","260385":"Cracks are appearing everywhere.","260395":"The first? Ooh, am I to receive a prize?","260396":"I could be the first to bring a new gem to light!","260397":"Do I have the whole place to myself!?","260398":"I beg you, no.","260399":"Surely you don't expect us to wade ashore?","260400":"Where is the welcome party?","260401":"I'm really much better at self-editing on paper...","260402":"We'll come flooding in now, I'm sure.","260403":"A gateway to imagination!","260422":"We're out of things to do but wait for the ferry.","260423":"We're bored now, so we're leaving.","260426":"You can't treat us like this!","260427":"My heart's filled with hatred!","260428":"I could smash the walls!","260429":"Hear the plea of the multitude!","260430":"A matter o' time before we explode!","260431":"Ruddy feudal system!","260432":"Petitions and signat'ries is all we need.","260433":"We're one angry voice!","260434":"I'm thinkin' of joining the chartists!","260435":"If you don't listen, things are gonna get dangerous!","260466":"If war is what it takes!","260467":"You'd hardly call it a war yet.","260468":"We're all behind you.","260469":"A civilian can voice his support.","260470":"From conflict come bold futures.","260471":"We're a united front.","260477":"An overwhelmingly positive edition!","260478":"We'll be alright.","260479":"If there's danger, tell us.","260480":"Should we be worried now?","260488":"A glowing review, absolutely no need to change it!","260489":"Ah! Good news!","260490":"We could hardly dig anything up! A-haha.","260491":"Your conscience must be spotless!","260492":"You'll want to leave this one as it is, won't you?","260493":"Too harsh?","260494":"Does it go too far?","260495":"It's as kind as we could make it.","260496":"I tried sweetening it.","260497":"We all have to swallow bitter pills sometimes.","260498":"We have done our best.","260499":"Once bright blossom now rotting stench!","260500":"I care not even for my craft.","260501":"We are a dying dream!","260502":"Bound in poison ivy!","260503":"Despair, may it all end soon.","260504":"My soul to the devil, or anyone!","260505":"If god exists, he is too cruel!","260506":"Piteous hole, a sickness of the soul.","260507":"All of my life, for nothing!","260508":"Like Persephone, I count my days in hell.","260519":"Are you sur— Of course you're sure.","260520":"Mum's the word.","260521":"I'm certain they won't read between the lines.","260522":"Call it a white lie.","260523":"The subtext is totally imperceptible.","260524":"Poetic licence.","260525":"It took minimal revision.","260526":"Something like this?","260527":"It is but a passing tempest!","260528":"Beyond the field of battle, beds of sweet lavender.","260529":"If we must have war, we shall win!","260530":"After all, papers are for drumming-up support.","260531":"You certainly have us by the leash!","260532":"It is possible to survive on scraps.","260533":"Diverting.","260534":"What glad news.","260535":"Sound the trumpets!","260536":"You are always uniquely diplomatic.","260537":"We will all be absolutely behind you.","260538":"Nobody would dare challenge your authority!","260539":"Frightening stuff!","260540":"You won't hear a peep from me.","260544":"It can only do them good, I'm sure.","260545":"Austerity, very wise.","260546":"I don't think it too severe, not at all.","260547":"Sometimes nice to have tangential news.","260548":"I don't think it's misleading.","260549":"There may be the odd unchecked fact.","260550":"Should keep them flicking through pages.","260551":"That should draw attention away from...hm.","260552":"Please, don't let them hurt me!","260553":"I am terribly, terribly afraid.","260554":"We will soon be grieving over the dead!","260555":"Candlepower ain't enough for this job.","260556":"We need 'lectricity to even start!","260557":"This place needs jolting into life!","260558":"It's important to be happy.","260559":"I think they'll swallow it.","260560":"It's a different perspective.","260564":"There's no electric!","260565":"Oi! Who turned off the lights?","260566":"We've run out of juice!","260567":"We shall not weary, but fight the eagle's grasp!","260568":"Will another glorious field be won this day?","260569":"I can already feel the swell of triumph!","260572":"Do you not see I'm incandescent?!","260573":"These conditions are an insult!","260574":"Not even the balustrades are burnished!","260575":"Just plain rude!","260576":"You will improve my situation at once!","260577":"It's tattier here than a pauper's trouser!","260578":"Of course I'm going to say what I think!","260579":"This city is an abomination!","260580":"The service is ruddy despicable!","260581":"I demand every appurtenance of my station!","260582":"The enemy has no chance of crashing our economy!","260583":"The enemy won't rock our boat, eh!","260584":"We're as safe as my nest egg.","260585":"I'm confident this island is impregnable!","260586":"Trust me, this rock is absolutely secure!","260587":"A war might even boost the markets.","260594":"For god's sake keep us safe can't you!?","260595":"The invaders will know who I am!","260596":"I will not be a prisoner in my own home!","260603":"We're quite out of energy!","260604":"We feel powerless!","260605":"There is simply no spark!","260612":"On the brink of eruption!","260613":"Who neglects their affairs in this way!","260614":"Absolute zero!","260615":"My reaction is not remotely extreme!","260616":"I am positively indignant!","260617":"Categorically unacceptable!","260618":"A failed experiment!","260619":"A place where ignorance abounds!","260620":"I am one negative particle!","260621":"Life must improve by a factor of 1000!","260622":"Perhaps war will spur scientific growth.","260623":"Conflict can sometimes be a catalyst.","260624":"War is always a litmus test.","260625":"Our chances look good on paper.","260626":"Unless the situation changes, I'll keep to my work.","260627":"Calculations show we are quite safe for the moment.","260633":"I'm sorry I'm no military engineer.","260634":"If I could only fashion a grenado…","260635":"I wish I'd studied military science.","260822":"Electricity is essential!","260823":"Did you forget to flick the switch?","260824":"Direct current now!","260838":"I am certain Alonso can be a majestic butterfly, once he emerges from his alarmingly spiny cocoon!","260839":"Mr Malching sent me a forward proposal. I myself then forwarded it to the fireplace.","260840":"I'm sure Mr Gasparov's people are as much in love with his designs as he is.","260841":"I often take tea with Beryl to see how her funny little urchins are getting along.","260842":"We all know Willie's silly, but I won't be the one to say he can't get his act together.","260843":"I admire how tranquil Lady Margaret is, and after all that has happened to her family.","260844":"Admiral Vicente does have a very cold sort of laugh.","260845":"It is emboldening to be among Jean La Fortune's young and aspiring people!","260846":"I still believe the Jorgensen Trust would be of interest to Her Majesty the Queen.","260847":"If ever you lack inspiration, seek Sir Archie, he is ever so happy to help!","260848":"Poor Anne Harlow. It does distress me to see how her star has fallen.","260849":"Old Nate has a lovely time up in that balloon. Perhaps he could make one for me!","260850":"I wish I were Isabel. Clever and cunning, and fighting for freedom!","260851":"I simply love Madame Kahina's shop, I hope it doesn't bother her I never buy anything.","260852":"I'm sure like so many others, Edvard could have been a good person.","260853":"Mr. Bleakworth does isolate himself, he should really try and take some fresh air.","260854":"I always adored the rambling talk of travelling ambassadors - be careful what you wish for.","260855":"My mother the Empress would have me carry out her orders instead. But I cannot, I cannot...","260862":"I'd be more modest about my eight treaties on equality, if they weren't still so goddamn necessary!","260863":"At school, they said I'd make a fine preacher. That's one thing I made sure I never did do.","260864":"The perfect society IS possible, if all spring in the same direction, like an arrow from the bowstring.","260865":"I found medicine very tedious, you need a lot of patients.","260866":"Time and struggle right wrong, but I've not much of either left to give.","260867":"Eli Bleakworth's small mind follows duty blind.","260868":"Artur and I became good friends, in spite of our contradictions.","260869":"Looking for my little regulars? Ah you won't spot 'em so easy.","260870":"Give 'em work and education, and they'll forgive yer the rest.","260871":"I pride meself on what I've built, for the urchins.","260872":"People should love yer, and if they don't, should fear yer.","260873":"What's down in the hold is my concern not yours, dear.","260874":"She may look sweet, but she'll hit below the belt if she has to.","260875":"If you want to get ahead, keep on the move.","260876":"They know not to be followed, they do.","260877":"We all have our little superstitions. I like to keep a knife in me satin boots.","260878":"Careful who you call friends. I'd rather have a bar of gold than a hundred of silver.","260879":"Keep your cards close to your chest, dearie. Check every dice thrice.","260880":"They call me a saint! Bless their little hearts, they don't know I'm a sinner!","260881":"I'll let you in on a secret, I'll always try to be nice. Life's too short.","260882":"I think we all know Willie's a numbskull. That's why we love him.","260883":"Bente is lovely; she knows absolutely nothing about the world, and the way things are.","260884":"Princess Qing enjoys forgeries like they're masterworks, and y'know, I agree with her.","260885":"God knows I'm not perfect, but Alonso might consider going to confession once in a while.","260886":"I reckon George Smith could've made a lot of money if he weren't such a stickler.","260887":"Last time Gasparov gave me a lecture, I pocketed a drawer of his silverware.","260888":"Carl is a disgusting, downright shameful creature, and I can't stop thinking about him.","260889":"You'd have to be pretty gullible to believe Lady Margaret's what she seems.","260890":"I've played chess with Silva; when he saw he was losing, he tried to upset the board.","260892":"Turning her back on the beau monde, Miss Harlow brings shame upon her family name.","260893":"Damn those pirates. Damn their greed!","260894":"Isabel Sarmento shakes the foundations of society! They should feed her to the lions!","260895":"I don't know where Kahina gets her prices!","260896":"I don't know that a bust chiselled in my image could ever really capture my true spirit!","260897":"I've been seeing Dr. Fraud for some time now. I'd recommend probing psychoanalysis to anyone.","260898":"Sacrifices must be made for us to have harmony here.","260899":"Call me old-fashioned, but I like to keep order.","260900":"Everything in its right place, and to everything its due.","260901":"I am a fossil, I won't pretend to understand modern ways.","260902":"My fleet are as unswerving as I, in their obligations.","260903":"I have ships in many harbours.","260904":"Humble trade ships, nothing more.","260905":"The face that launched a thousand ships.","260906":"I'd rather count heads than have four-poster beds.","260907":"I don't need to dress like Pope Joan to rule these reprobates.","260908":"Yeah life here's miserable, spare me the requiem.","260909":"Father'd've hated to see me live like this, but I don't care.","260910":"Yeah, I stole this ship. Start as you mean to go on!","260911":"No coward man is Annie's match at sea.","260912":"The ship it was their coffin, and their grave it was the sea","260913":"We pirates may not rule the waves, but we make them bloody choppy.","260914":"Sherwood forest, where the merry men hide out.","260915":"Our code may be strict, but it keeps our feet on the ground.","260916":"We're our own masters now, and we're building something here.","260917":"Little by little, the bird builds its nest.","260918":"Now we've a taste of freedom, we're not going to let go.","260919":"If only people listened, we'd lay down our guns.","260920":"We've had to fight to keep ourselves afloat.","260921":"I hope there comes a time we can stop fighting.","260922":"All the punishments you see are more than justified!","260923":"Too late to recover these sinners from Satan.","260924":"No way out, and no way in. Well, except through the door.","260925":"Look at them. Sickening specimens.","260926":"Don't try and rock the boat.","260927":"Meticulously drilled, and loyal to the crown.","260928":"Transportation worse than prison? Don't be so sure!","260929":"The antithesis of Noah's Ark.","260930":"I hope you aren't looking for life here.","260931":"I used to dangle from the eaves of buildings like these.","260932":"My customers appreciate the tranquillity.","260933":"After everything, I can forgive some peace and quiet.","260934":"It's wise to be ready to move on, to take change in your stride.","260935":"My routes crisscross the globe, to ensure I have the best to offer.","260936":"You don't always need to run a tight ship.","260937":"Ships don't really interest me.","260938":"This is where liberation starts.","260939":"We make do with what we have.","260940":"I hope they'll remember this as the birthplace of a revolution.","260941":"This is our new home now, we should be happy for that.","260942":"We've got to be agile, ready to move at the drop of a hat.","260943":"We can load up in a day, and be gone in a night.","260944":"It's hard to get ships. We are lucky to have friends to help us.","260945":"We never sink a ship if we can take it.","260946":"A discretionary fleet for national emergencies.","260947":"I want to be a spearhead not a figurehead.","260948":"We do not solicit violence, yet under my rule it seems as constant as the crashing waves.","260949":"I do not forget the sacrifice of these sailors on my account.","260950":"Should hold together for a time.","260951":"Soldiers had no use for the iron, all frozen such as they were.","260952":"I scratched and scraped for this.","260953":"I always dreamed of a little shack to call my own.","260954":"She used to be a wreck, but you'd never guess.","260955":"I put a lot o' graft into fixing her up.","260956":"The bow's made o' hodgepodge.","260957":"Made of sterner stuff— like boiled hooves.","260958":"Keep out! None of your business!","260959":"If your father had only let me in, we could have built this together...","260960":"This city will be a credit to our family, you'll see.","260961":"Commerce and industry can haul Goode and Sons back from the grave.","260962":"I modernised the trade fleet the moment I took control.","260963":"The sea is in my blood, just as much as it was in your father's.","260964":"I have routes all planned out, they're perfect! Perfect!","260965":"Of course I have enough experience handling sailors!","260970":"Too soon to head home?","260971":"Have we enough biscuit to last us?","260972":"We better let you decide, admiral.","260973":"What are our chances?","260974":"Do you think we can make it?","260983":"I've recently discovered hypnosis— works wonders on the sleepless.","260984":"Natural history helps us understand why the crocodile mother defends its brood, or the scorpion keeps a sting in its tail.","260985":"I prefer coffee of late. One learns to embrace the bitterness.","260986":"I retired from the spotlight when I remarried. But being part of the royal council is a pleasing distraction.","260987":"Though I've been a Hunt for a long time, it's as my dead brother used to say; once a Harlow, always a Harlow.","260988":"I would not leave this life, until I felt I'd achieved a sense of peace.","260989":"If people want something to get behind, we have to encourage them!","260990":"Wibblesock is a small boy, with the temerity to believe life is some schoolyard game.","260992":"I have had the misfortune to take tea with Beryl, her piggled cakes and sugary tea.","260993":"Artur's own reflection will swallow him up soon enough.","260994":"Her Majesty honours me with a position on the council, but I prefer to stay out of the light.","260995":"Testing times for the monarchy, but I'm sure balance will be restored soon.","260996":"Silva is from a rival empire. You should think about eliminating him.","260997":"Poor Anne. She is my niece you know—our ways are so different I often forget.","260998":"The unpredictable, like Graves, develop no power to predict.","260999":"George Smith wants a better world? Well.. don't we all!","261000":"Von Malching keeps things to himself, I like that.","261001":"Proud to be exactly what my father wasn't - a traitor! God save the Queen!","261002":"A thousand privateers who would die to live, and me, who lives only to die.","261003":"We are wronged, all of us. The Empire shall feel the wrath of scimitar, spear and cutlass!","261004":"My whole house gone to hell, but for I, the last swish of its flaming tail.","261005":"If execution was good enough for my brother, it'll be good enough for Her Majesty.","261006":"Any pirate not flying my flag is a dead man - you hear me La Fortune?!","261007":"Even I don't completely hate Bente.","261008":"Aunt Maggie doesn't approve of barefaced vengeance.","261009":"I'll jam the crown down over her ears, for my father 'Ben Harlow!'","261010":"I'll rip off Blake's toupee, and make him eat it like a dog.","261011":"Graves has it right, only death can wash away the pain!","261012":"If Aunt Maggie won't fight tooth and nail for our blood, then I'll have to go it alone.","261014":"Independence works two ways - rely on no-one, and no-one relies on you.","261015":"I have a young family whose hopes rest on a roll of the dice. But at least we have dice to roll.","261016":"Who will benefit from our defiance? All that are human.","261017":"I'm pretty good at talking my way out, but I rarely get that luxury.","261018":"If we're such small fish, why can't they just let us swim?","261020":"I'm sure the Empire's just as bad as La Corona. Of course, I wouldn't tell Her Majesty that!","261021":"We may seem dissimilar, but Beryl and I are a lot alike.","261022":"George should consider practising what he preaches.","261023":"Archibald's 'constitution' is unconstitutional, just like every government ever.","261024":"Anne's got no code. She'll fight anyone and everyone.","261025":"I wouldn't wager a newt on Wibblesock, if he were the last egg in the pond.","261026":"At least Bente came here and heard us out, but I wouldn't want her to have to help us.","261027":"Eli Bleakworth's kind don't see beyond lines, it's all always black or white.","261028":"If Alonso cooperated, we'd have this place for ourselves. But he's crazy, insane!","261029":"Lady Margaret? I'd be surprised if she didn't have her moments of madness.","261030":"Gasparov's French is impressive, from the outside at least.","261031":"This rock's for the worst of the worst, you'll not find a goodly soul upon it!","261032":"All Her Majesty asks of me, is that I keep the peace.","261033":"I've got better things to do than bleat with you over H.M.'s rotten biscuits and insipid tea.","261034":"The chimpanzees can swing about as much as they like inside— good practice for the gallows.","261035":"Give 'em an inch, they take a mile. They even have their own cells now!","261036":"Do I condemn you now, or merely give you a length of rope with which to strangle yourself?","261037":"Malching must know that crime never pays.","261038":"If I could break one of Beryl's urchins, we'd have her head in the gibbet.","261039":"I don't think Sir Archibald has the stomach for my work.","261040":"I saw Benjamin Harlow drop, and will see his pirate niece Anne hang just the same!","261041":"Anne Harlow proves even the nobility can be corrupted by the Devil.","261042":"Jean LaFortune should stop gambling on his life, and hand himself in.","261043":"Is it only Madame Kahina's prices that are criminal, or is there some truth to these rumours about her past?","261044":"Sarmento is a myth, or we'd have had her in for interrogation long ago.","261045":"Admiral Silva serves a different Empire, and is therefore not in my jurisdiction.","261046":"Graves will be caught, and when he is he will pay the maximum possible penalty.","261047":"This is a new life for me, I still have luxury, without any of the danger.","261048":"I don't know if the Queen knows what a burden power over life and death becomes.","261049":"People see what they want to see. As the years pass, I've learned to play on those assumptions.","261050":"It's better to hold on to your secrets, I can tell you that for free.","261051":"I'm expecting a javelin through the back at any moment.","261052":"Can bad actions have good reasons? I try not to think about it anymore.","261053":"Archie's mind is a lot sharper than he lets on.","261054":"Isabel and her people want change, only fools aren't open to that.","261055":"For Isabel, I'd moonlight again, if only to remember how it feels.","261056":"Maybe Old Nathaniel doesn't know, but the spirit of the dead lives on in their possessions.","261057":"Eli thinks everyone has to suffer for justice to be done.","261058":"Vicente is paranoid I study the book of Judith.","261059":"I'll join them again in the fields... my brothers and sisters, once we have set this land free.","261060":"Jean is reckless like my brother was. I don't blame him. He is only trying to survive, to protect the ones he loves.","261061":"I was young when I joined the movement, I never imagined I would one day be giving the orders.","261062":"This is not about revenge, but securing our people a future free of La Corona. We have to stick together.","261063":"My brother fought back violently against La Corona. He was murdered. We have to try another way.","261064":"If we strike against La Corona, we have to make it count!","261065":"Let Admiral Silva cling to his dying dream, we hear the little birds of freedom sing!","261066":"La Corona may be our enemy, not the Queen, but to trust empire for us is impossible.","261067":"If Anne Harlow could forget the past, we could build a better future together.","261068":"Alonso is a powder keg. He threatens to destroy the delicate balance we've worked so hard for.","261069":"Madame Kahina is the best. Quick, clean, and never draws attention. How does she do it?","261070":"George dances well for an invalid, we all need to cut free sometimes.","261072":"I took this command because it has always been my destiny. Under my leadership, La Corona shall once more be victorious.","261073":"Apparently my father disliked babies. I think I shall be as decisive, but slightly less mad.","261074":"Lady Margaret Hunt, née Harlow, is a respected voice on the Royal Council.","261075":"It doesn't matter what you think of me, it is what I think of you.","261076":"Archie has been like a father to me, his company fills me with all those paternal hopes and comforts.","261077":"Archie never stops me eating jam, and will suffer the subsequent indigestion for me too!","261078":"If not for Archie, the rest would still be leading me up and down stairs like an infant.","261079":"Sarmento is a strong woman, let us hope she keeps no secrets from us.","261080":"Anne Harlow must know that no injustice can excuse her own crimes.","261081":"Jean La Fortune is a pirate whose name I too-commonly hear.","261082":"The council has agreed my prison reforms, so I hope Mr. Bleakworth will bend a little.","261083":"Miss Jorgensen is a distant relative. Although all my relatives are quite distant.","261084":"I understand we have visiting royalty in Princess Qing. She's a gentle soul.","261085":"Willie Wibblesock? A made-up name surely?!","261086":"It's Mr von Malching. I will never offer that awful man a barony.","261088":"The presence of Vicente Silva is clearly an attempt by La Corona to challenge my authority here.","261089":"Semaphore stations'll soon be disused - there's a tip for old iron.","261090":"Isabel's people are resistors, fighting for their Ohms.","261091":"Found an egg with a palace in it. Fixed the hinge and stuck it on the bow of my lady blimp.","261092":"Zeppelins'll take off, you'll see. Soon they'll all want a piece of my lady blimp.","261093":"Turn a greasy hat inside out, and it looks to 'ave been oiled purposely!","261094":"Coffins make nice boats. But make sure the lid doesn't shut on you.","261095":"I could use George Smith's bath chair, once he's gone. Can't be long now can it?","261096":"Archibald Blake commissioned the Queen a balloon, then he realised it was all a lot of hot air.","261097":"The Queen may have snatched every last bit of land and sea, but I have the skies to meself.","261098":"Alonso's good to follow at a distance; for all the leftovers.","261099":"That windsock Willie still complaining? The lad doesn't know his luck.","261100":"Don't dabble with Kahina, she's a lethal businesswoman.","261101":"I offered Bente a place on my balloon, but she guffawed and called it cheating!","261102":"I shouldn't have to play second fiddle to anyone.","261103":"I ride my Phaeton more and more often to the palace, I'm in great demand with Queen and council you see.","261104":"Goode and Sons has a future among the constellations, not in petty ship trades!","261105":"I was born for this age. With my Olympian ideas, my industry, my sacrifice, all is possible!","261106":"Why should his passion and ambition count against a man?","261107":"The responsibility could weigh heavy, but I am more than equal, much more.","261108":"Naturally I deal with Sir Archibald; it's his duty to greet Her Majesty's proudest subjects.","261109":"Isabel Sarmento? Never heard of her.","261110":"I'm watching you. Any suspicious behaviour will be reported immediately to Eli.","261111":"Samuel was always so suspicious of Lady Hunt, but she has a seat on the royal council for goodness' sake!","261112":"If only I had the invitingly empty sort of paper for writing, not lined, for accounting.","261113":"Fictions only remind me how little of my own writing I've done lately.","261114":"If ever I seem far away, remember so were you, those long years.","261115":"One should get to know one's kin, shouldn't one?","261116":"Getting things done bright and early maintains discipline for the remaining day.","261117":"After a jam scone at teatime, I feel a different person. That is to say, a sympathetic one.","261118":"I can't see how any woman finds calisthenics remotely emancipating.","261119":"I have to make do with living vicariously through your exploits.","261120":"The land of many rivers shall see me again, when all is forgiven.","261121":"Old pal, don't you find it strange they keep the recipe for sausage so secret?!","261122":"If the body is the field in which the mind works, would you farm on barren soil?","261123":"Do not incite violence. Prepare for it.","261124":"The music here is fine, but it lacks the colour of a raga.","261125":"I vowed to defend you, it requires no explanation.","261126":"Compared to what brought us together, this is nothing, old pal.","261127":"We met in war; we will find ourselves there again. We must be prepared for that moment.","261128":"Perhaps this island is as yet unclaimed?","261129":"Does this land belong to your Queen, or may I...?","261130":"I wish to found a new kingdom here.","261131":"Could this be my lucky island!?","261132":"If you don't want it, you should share it.","261133":"This one doesn't look too scary, d'you mind?","261136":"When loved ones pass away, it helps to keep yourself occupied with joyful things!","261137":"I knew the moment we met, the jolly royal council would come around to you!","261138":"I for one hope you uncover proof of your father's innocence!","261140":"If you need counsel during the trial, my door is always open.","261141":"There's been a dreadful misunderstanding, it's now I need your support most.","261142":"Perhaps you can convince them; all I want is peace!","261144":"I see. You have come home to great responsibility, and I have left home with it.","261145":"I am also keen to work with the Queen. Perhaps one day you will help arrange a meeting?","261146":"Isabel's rebellion I think, is the first I understand. But the Pyrphorian danger is greatly to be feared.","261147":"I am very curious to see your legal process in action!","261148":"Sorry your father's dead. I remember when I lost me old mum; always think of her when things are going wrong.","261149":"Like you, I'd do anything for the Queen. Reminds me of me mum. Younger et cetera, but you know, intimidating.","261150":"I hear stories about those Pyrphorians that have me tossing and turning til daybreak.","261151":"Cor, that Edvard eh? Deserves a really nasty end!","261152":"Don't let them judge you by your father's actions; you're your own person.","261153":"I hear you're building warships—arms dealer to the Empire…","261154":"Isabel remains fundamentally good. You can trust her to seek out truth.","261155":"No greater punishment exists for your Uncle Edvard than a fair trial.","261156":"Watch out. There'll be trouble on the way if you start stirring in the pond.","261157":"So you think you're high society now you're in with the Queen?","261158":"Oh, now you've stirred up the old hornet’s nest.","261159":"I always try to avoid the courtroom whenever I can.","261160":"Your family is infamous, but it's not all about you and your father, you know.","261161":"A pity, isn't it? Vulgar warships are scarcely the sort of royal commission I'd want.","261162":"The colonies are a distraction for the distracted.","261163":"Glad my bespoke silverware is finally safe.","261164":"Father failed you too, did he? You'll want to restore your family's soiled name.","261165":"Edvard's right, where is our royal fleet commission?","261166":"Of course, only a fool would have let Prosperity slip in the first place. The clue is in the name!","261167":"Family only ever hold us back.","261168":"So, your father was a traitor, eh? Sounds like my sort of fellow!","261169":"Why lose your head over a family scandal, when you could be losing it in so much more interesting ways?!","261170":"Welcome to the jungle!","261171":"Wow, your family is really messed up!","261172":"You're lucky your family's treachery is not pertinent to La Corona.","261173":"If the Empire is building a fleet, I better start building one too…","261174":"Sarmento is a sworn enemy of La Corona. One day we will deal with her rabble once and for all.","261175":"If real justice were done, Prosperity would still belong to La Corona, like back in the old days!","261176":"A terrible shame, what happened to your father, dear child.","261177":"You could be the star all of us have so long waited for.","261178":"Chasing after the past won't make you happy, my dear. Let it go—ring in the future!","261179":"I imagine the Queen naively thinks the trial might restore some of her authority.","261180":"My father gave his life to his king. Your father gave his life to his Queen. Still they're never sated.","261181":"You'd fight the crown if you knew the truth, not crawl beneath it.","261182":"Say hello to my old mate Jean, won't yer?","261183":"My father never had the privilege of a trial. Your Queen's father near strung him up himself.","261186":"Believe me, I share Isabel's cause, but I already have enough trouble with the Empire.","261188":"We can't deny it's a difficult time. The sale of Prosperity was highly destabilising for Her Majesty.","261192":"I've no doubt corruption runs in the family, and I'll be watching you closely.","261193":"Don't drag me into your conspiracy theories. Everybody knows your father was a crook.","261194":"If you weed out a single Pyrphorian you are to bring them to me first for questioning! Is that understood?","261196":"I may have known your father as a good man, but I don't know you at all.","261198":"Be careful out there. The rainforest is full of surprises.","261199":"Justice, revenge—the truth is never black and white.","261200":"If you do not fulfil our alliance, I fear it will be a humiliation.","261201":"Please aid me as you promised, and dispel this nightmare!","261202":"Were you expecting celebrations and a fatted calf on your return?","261206":"I'm in a war with your mate, but I think I know where your loyalties lie.","261208":"I'm at war with your ally. I appreciate this may be a difficult choice.","261209":"This isn't the nice sort of surprise is it?","261210":"I admit, a mafia is not very Jorgensen.","261212":"You and I share lifelong passions for discovery!","261214":"Your researches make me jump.","261231":"Started a little war with your friend, hope that won't turn the milk sour between us?","261320":"I declared war on your friend; guarantee they will be your friend no longer!","261321":"I clash with your vile acquaintance; will you follow in fashion?","261322":"I am about to hurt your friend. Wanna join in?","261323":"I have declared war on your ally, so you'd better choose carefully.","261352":"I have no choice but to punish your friend, but that is no reason for us to quarrel.","261356":"You're not involved in the mafia, are you?","261357":"It seems I had unexpected visitors!","261358":"Maybe I shouldn't go away so often…","261359":"I'm sure you knew nothing about these creeps.","261360":"It must have been the trustees.","261361":"But surely you don't think I would ever…?","261362":"Say you haven't lost trust in the Trust?","261363":"Oh why are my trustees such awful people!","261364":"You are dreaming up a brighter future!","261365":"Hurrah for science!","261366":"Your finger is very firmly on the pulse.","261367":"Isn't it all a bit sudden?","261368":"You skirt behind the curtain, knife in hand.","261369":"Shadows lift the window latch.","261370":"I found an alien bee among my flowers.","261371":"A strange fish was swimming with the shoal.","261372":"Mountains know which are the pure-hearted snowflakes.","261373":"It is my mother who pulls these strings.","261374":"I wished only to observe.","261375":"We are merely curious.","261376":"It is my mother the Empress, who embraces deception.","261377":"I feared the Empress would be displeased, if I did not send them.","261378":"I find your inventiveness fascinating.","261379":"I believe your future will blossom.","261380":"These strange concepts are inspiring.","261381":"You do not innovate, but imitate.","261382":"Technology is a form of greed.","261383":"Do not seek to improve nature.","261384":"Going behind me back, that is so naughty, that is!","261385":"I found 'em, you're in big trouble, you is!","261386":"Et tu Brute? Stab your old mate Wibbly?","261387":"Don't you start haunting me with your phantoms!","261388":"So…you're part of the mafia as well?","261389":"I am master of shadows! What do you mean you found 'em?","261390":"I honestly have no idea who they were.","261391":"Honour bright, I'll never do it again.","261392":"Means we're both as cunning as each other then, eh!","261393":"Don't reach up my sleeves, that is the first rule!","261394":"Cor science and all that? You're a braver one than I.","261395":"Nice science! Bit complicated though, innit?","261396":"Ooh, researching new tricks?","261397":"An apple fell on my head too, and it bloody hurt!","261398":"Science cheapens magic!","261399":"A magician NEVER reveals his secrets.","261400":"Your moles have always been blind.","261401":"What are all these flies on my walls?!","261402":"They may as well have had 'spy' written on their foreheads!","261403":"I prefer to have things out in the open.","261404":"I knew I didn't trust you.","261405":"You can't hide the truth forever.","261406":"Sharing ideas, nothing more.","261407":"I meant no disrespect.","261408":"You can't blame me for disbelieving.","261409":"I should know, trust works both ways.","261410":"Ah, a scholar of the sciences?","261411":"You look toward the future, as I do.","261412":"Innovation can realise our dream.","261413":"No one likes a know-it-all.","261414":"You have science, but no spirit.","261415":"Science and war often ride out together.","261416":"Now what do we have here?","261417":"I have eyes everywhere, dearie.","261418":"I know my urchins by face, and that's not one of them.","261419":"Curiosity killed the cat.","261420":"Yer a slippery snake in the pond y'are.","261421":"For every scamp you catch, there'll be three you've missed.","261422":"He can't be a spy; he's just a little boy.","261423":"One of mine? No, that can't be!","261424":"Me run a mafia? You must be mad.","261425":"Ah well, worth a sneaky try!","261426":"If yer can keep it to yerself, wonderful.","261427":"Don't let anybody sabotage yer genius.","261428":"Me regulars speak only of your advancement.","261429":"Yer think you can keep all those ideas to yerself?!","261430":"Why couldn't you give old Beryl the lowdown?","261431":"I hope you are going to share all yer fine ideas?","261432":"Seems I have a secret admirer!","261433":"I know every possible alcove.","261434":"A poor use of shadow.","261435":"I accept no imitations.","261436":"I've seen through your masquerade.","261437":"I have to keep up with trends somehow.","261438":"Virtuosos need their muses.","261439":"It's important to explore different spaces.","261440":"Great art takes inspiration where it can.","261441":"One has to stay in touch.","261442":"Science really is the art nouveau!","261443":"New techniques can freshen things up, certainly.","261444":"A scientific verticality!","261445":"I have no time for modernism.","261446":"Progress at the expense of beauty.","261447":"Buried in the future, you lose the zeitgeist.","261448":"Dabbling in disorganised crime?!","261449":"Who do you think you are, the scarlet pimple-nel?","261450":"Industrial sabotage!","261451":"Bamboozle me?!","261452":"Your blind mice have lost their tails!","261453":"How the devil did you find out!?","261454":"That is business these days.","261455":"Can't you see, everyone has spies!","261456":"Take my deception as a compliment!","261457":"No! No!! The fool was caught!","261458":"Your scientific dabbling is paying off.","261459":"Your science fixation doesn't look so freakish now!","261460":"Your ghoulish experimentations bear sublime fruit.","261461":"I should have the most fecund laboratories!","261462":"Why aren't my squares that brilliant?!","261463":"I want to profit from the scientific sphere!","261464":"Skulk in shade, guillotine blade.","261465":"Hide like a coward!","261466":"I have a sneaking suspicion…","261467":"Your emissaries curl like salted slugs.","261468":"I have blunted your dagger of espion.","261469":"Tentacles grow back.","261470":"I must be omnipresent.","261471":"They are my feelers, my antennae.","261472":"They foreshadow the coming frenzy.","261473":"Thank you for returning my cloak and dagger.","261474":"Science gives you new tools. I like new tools.","261475":"Your progress really gave me a jolt.","261476":"I also like to experiment.","261477":"I could make you my guinea pig?","261478":"Yet you fail to answer the fundamental questions.","261479":"I prefer practise to theory.","261480":"What are you hiding from?","261481":"Afraid to fight in the open?","261482":"Only cowards skulk in the shadows.","261483":"It's laughable you thought I wouldn't notice.","261484":"I've uncovered your little plot.","261485":"One of my scouts losing their way, that's all.","261486":"It was merely counter-espionage.","261487":"An inexcusable failure of my intelligence service.","261488":"Another slapdash infiltration.","261489":"It's your fault I'm suspicious in the first place.","261490":"Science can improve the economy and our quality of life.","261491":"I admire a good breakthrough.","261492":"Innovation is absolutely essential.","261493":"Your advances can't disguise your shoddy leadership.","261494":"I wait for the right moment before I advance.","261495":"Stop trying to get ahead!","261496":"So, you take pleasure in a masquerade?","261497":"There's no need for secrecy, I've nothing to hide.","261498":"So unnecessary, when all is out in the open.","261499":"Oh, then you don't trust me?","261500":"Come child, no need to hide your true feelings.","261501":"They are many and everywhere.","261502":"How silly to think I would hide something from you.","261503":"You see, we are all drawn to your remarkable aura.","261504":"I'm glad you found them, it shows you are on your guard.","261505":"How clever of you to have discovered them.","261506":"Most prudent to look to the future.","261507":"You young things with your wild ideas.","261508":"Your advances show a wisdom beyond your years.","261509":"Experiments will often go frightfully wrong.","261510":"You meddle in what you don't understand.","261511":"Stay clear of the laboratory if you want to avoid a nasty accident.","261512":"I'll smash something of yours soon enough.","261513":"I'm fighting your ally, save time and say I can drown you both.","261514":"I'd rather fight without you, but we had an agreement.","261515":"Just 'cos I fight for you, doesn't make us friends.","261516":"Come here at your peril.","261517":"I told you to stay away, or do you need you ears opening?","261518":"Not even death can make us happy.","261519":"Their blood'll beat while your heart still does.","261520":"Come on, that's an inanimate object!","261521":"Will you protect me and my family as you said you would?","261522":"It is a big risk for us, but oui, we will fight for you.","261523":"They pray morning and evening this war will end.","261524":"We desire only to defend these properties and the families that inhabit them.","261525":"War is bad for you, we have allies everywhere.","261526":"They'll lay down arms the moment you make a fair peace offer.","261527":"We are at war with your ally, let us see your true colours.","261529":"Unite! Unite!","261530":"I feel… most unwell.","261533":"Take the streets!","261534":"That's my boy in there!","261535":"My daughter… her forehead is burning!","261536":"Those poor people…","261537":"Father, who are those angry people?","261538":"A-chooo! Dear me.","261539":"This climate of instability is unsustainable…","261540":"Smoke can be seen for miles around.","261542":"This vile ague spells the end...","261551":"Fetid, festering filth.","261552":"Should've seen her face!","261553":"Fancy an ale after work?","261554":"It can never be replaced...","261555":"These daguerrotypes haven't really come out…","261556":"Gears completely corroded!","261557":"Things did seem to be moving speedily.","261558":"What a scam!","261559":"Hey, careful with that!","261561":"No slacking!","261562":"Fetch another cart boy, be quick.","261563":"A few too many weeds, but we're getting there.","261564":"No great shakes…","261565":"And it took so very long to arrive.","261566":"Where did you say you'd come from?","261567":"Oh, they're just adorable!","261568":"Rather have it with roast potatoes and a rich sauce.","261569":"A portal to a lost world!","261570":"All I can see is a fat patina of dust.","261571":"Have you heard? We're at war.","261572":"Good tidings from the front!","261573":"Sound the alarm!","261574":"No-one leaves Wormways in a hurry.","261575":"I worry for our relations with the South.","261576":"Wi! Keep it under wraps.","261577":"When will his children step from the shadow?","261578":"Is it just the wind that howls at night...?","261579":"I've got it all over my hands now!","261580":"That fish pie smells gurt lush.","261581":"Broken glass all over the blimmin linoleum.","261582":"I swear! I saw a spectre upon the stair!","261583":"Accompany me along the promenade?","261584":"Anything show up on the thermogram?","261586":"I want to know if those pianoforte lessons were money well spent.","261587":"...then he leered to one side, and dropped his snuff all over the cobbles!","261588":"..and then she popped the little fondant in her mouth!","261589":"Oh but surely you've seen it? Mesmerising!","261590":"Can't believe he forgot his shovel!","261591":"It was a sumptuous spread, it really was.","261592":"Travel always makes one a little weary.","261593":"Please don't leave your crate unattended, sir.","261594":"I thought you were keeping tally?!","261595":"I really would rather return to sunlight, sweet darling.","261596":"There's a distinct whiff of powder in the air…","261597":"The outlook is unremittingly bleak.","261598":"To arms, you fools!","261599":"Can I have your leftover gruel? I'm wasting away!","261600":"Oooh! News from the palace!","261601":"Bon chance, mon ami!","261602":"Samuel Goode, go against a lifetime of piety?!","261603":"It's brought on my lumbago.","261604":"Don't even mind the neighbours.","261605":"Dreams of nuts, bolts and washers.","261606":"Cheeky flat cap, mate. Is it new?","261607":"It's the second verse that doesn't scan!","261608":"He couldn't have been more obnoxious..","261609":"So satisfying that it performs as designed.","261610":"Yes, I bumped into her at the hatter's.","261611":"Toss me a chisel.","261612":"Stand back, I would. Looks like the tubes need a flush.","261613":"Here's a fresh seam, have a swing at that boy.","261614":"There be potholes, so watch out.","261615":"I'm not certain I want to go up that enormous hill.","261616":"We're tired, papa, we want to go home!","261617":"Hark at you, back on dry land...","261618":"Extraordinary! What a majestic animal…","261619":"And people come here for fun, you say?","261620":"History always seemed such a closed book!","261621":"The drums of war can be heard.","261622":"They say we might hold out yet.","261623":"Defend our home!","261624":"Please, me shackles are a bit tight.","261625":"Have you been invited to the Duke's soirée?","261626":"A little good angel took me away to dream of a better place...","261627":"Samuel —a traitor!?","261628":"Over millennia, the Inuit have learned to adapt.","261629":"Oh, confetti!","261630":"Barn's filled with owls. We must have dormice...","261631":"Dirty rotten vandal!","261632":"I have a fitting for new boots.","261633":"The corset is a little tight…","261634":"Duppler's postulations do encourage further study.","261635":"A surfeit of tag-rag-and-bobtail!","261636":"Fell off his yacht and drowned, hilarity ensued!","261637":"Look out below!","261638":"I mean to see every exhibit, and then see them again!","261639":"Someone bring forth a light!","261640":"The painters at their easels are spoiled by these vistas.","261641":"Relaxed, and somewhat stimulated...","261642":"Your vessel shall be subject to an inspection…","261643":"Oi! Move, lad!","261644":"All my life, I have been utterly ignorant!","261645":"Rather a lot of old hat!","261646":"Dark times ahead, I wonder?","261647":"Cheer up, we're holding out!","261648":"We're going to be blown away...","261649":"Too late! Go on without me...","261650":"You spoiling for a fight?","261651":"Canapé ma'am?","261652":"I'd rather die free…","261653":"It's Edvard now, like it or not…","261654":"Perhaps the supplies rotted?","261657":"Oh mother, look!","261659":"Who's stinking like cut cheese?","261660":"Ought worth reading in the newsrag?","261661":"She said my work was mediocre!","261662":"Oh! I must write that down!","261663":"...and blew him across the laboratory! dreadful times...","261664":"See, here? The remarkable refractions of light.","261665":"Oh! Have you not been introduced?","261666":"Us simple country folk have never seen anything like it!","261667":"Be there tonight — the Union meeting.","261668":"Maybe three, four bushels? I wouldn't like to say.","261669":"It's all the more vivid from my balcony…","261670":"The bellboy showed no emotion whatsoever…","261671":"Cut-price watches, madam?","261672":"Sorry, that's as low as I go.","261673":"(laugh) Did you see what it just did?","261674":"Oh!

Let's roll up our sleeves and make a difference.","264392":"I hope you fight for our rights.","264393":"I don't usually approve of violence, but…","264394":"Sometimes we need to take action.","264395":"We should try to win hastily!","264396":"Our enemies are the tyrants!","264397":"We shall prevail for greater good!","264403":"Could they break our spirit…?","264404":"They have no scruples!","264405":"Our future is threatened!","264408":"We require electrical power!","264409":"The dream depends on electricity!","264410":"We need to feel connected!","264419":"Hallelujah.","264420":"The dream is kept alive!","264421":"Praise be for the certainties we have!","264426":"I am eternally grateful for your support.","264427":"You have proven all is still possible.","264428":"You endure where others have not.","264433":"We cannot allow this to stop us believing.","264434":"We have let a chance pass us by.","264435":"Now I feel the wind begin to bite.","264440":"Please, don't follow the Arctic Council's example.","264441":"Perhaps you don't realise the scale of this undertaking.","264442":"You don't seem as committed as the others.","264447":"I, Lady Faithful, knock at every door to rouse the bold and the daring.","264448":"You may know of my husband, Sir John Faithful whose Arctic expedition is lost and forsaken?","264449":"Be assured, your efforts will be suitably rewarded.","264450":"We must stick together if we are to endure the chill.","264451":"It cannot be long now before we find something.","264456":"The absence of a base camp might explain why the Arctic council never sustained their rescue efforts.","264457":"This encampment must embody hope, our one comfort in the wilderness.","264460":"Until the fate of any lost ship is affirmed, our efforts should not diminish.","264461":"Many ships from many sponsors, united by a profound desire to bring back those men alive.","264464":"Just when I was beginning to lose faith.","264465":"If we pull together like this, who knows what we can achieve.","264466":"We must thank the Inuit spirits who dwell here.","264467":"We can do it.","264468":"Yes, I fear we must.","264469":"Yes, we must set our preconceptions aside.","264470":"It would only make me worry.","264471":"Something urges me not to.","264472":"It's impossible.","264496":"I'm very grateful.","264497":"You are doing marvellous work.","264498":"Your generosity won't be forgotten.","264542":"We must rally together now, if we are to find them.","264543":"I value any help I can get, from any direction.","264544":"You will be rewarded, I promise.","264547":"Good, we all are with you.","264548":"Thank you.","264550":"They said it was impossible, you proved them wrong!","264551":"You have survived the elements!","264555":"Was the reward not substantial enough?","264556":"What could have led you astray?","264557":"Seems we've not learned from the mistakes of the past.","264558":"The cold has got to us.","264560":"The Arctic summer is only a brief window.","264561":"We don't have much time.","264563":"It does not end there, we must keep going.","264564":"This must be a sustained effort.","264565":"I know it feels like going from one pole to another.","264569":"Have you something?","264570":"Something to give us hope?","264572":"I await news of our next compass heading.","264573":"The matter is out of our hands for the time being.","264578":"The most ambitious rescue I've had the honour to be part of.","264579":"I hoped and feared I might one day have the privilege of such an undertaking.","264580":"Can we do worse than the Arctic council? They're afraid of the ice in their whisky!","264581":"I will not rest while fellow seamen succumb to the cold, we are with you!","264582":"The Northwest passage is uncharted, Admiral. More than preparation, we need luck.","264583":"I don't want to join the many that tried and failed to find them.","264584":"It's a cairn o'rocks stacked by human hand! We have stumbled upon Sir John Faithful's last encampment!","264585":"We've found no trace of Sir John and his crew, let us hope there is time to try again.","264586":"We must be better prepared if we are to follow in the fateful footsteps of Sir John.","264587":"I knew another captain who ventured this far north, but I know him no more.","264588":"We all know this could be our last expedition, so may it be a fine one!","264589":"If we die in the attempt, it won't be for a lack of commitment.","264590":"It'll be the stuff of folklore if we succeed and bring back Sir John.","264591":"Bears, vicious whales and restless spirits await us, if the tales are to be believed.","264592":"It's a lot to ask, but to a seaman there's no challenge to rival the Arctic.","264593":"A wise seaman would trust the Inuits. They know their land better than we ever will.","264594":"I myself have little experience of the Arctic, but stand beside you.","264595":"Seaman's intuition tells me they came this way, but I've been wrong before.","264596":"I fear we may be as lost as the original expedition.","264597":"Let's hope we warm mother nature's frozen heart soon.","264598":"The chill already gnaws at the bones of our crew.","264599":"If I know Sir John Faithful right, I'd say he came this way.","264600":"You made a seal hole, now catch a seal!","264601":"If these men seem impervious to cold, it's Lady Faithful's fire we have to thank.","264602":"I've met few so hardy as Lady Faithful, we can't let her down now.","264603":"And I thought the Arctic Council's efforts were pathetic.","264604":"We might have turned back long ago, had the mysteries of the ice not drawn us in.","264605":"Even I have rarely seen such extremes, and worse may be yet to come.","264606":"We cannot be too thorough in our preparations, yet we must also be swift.","264607":"We must make waves, channel my John's spirit of adventure.","264608":"Because we have failed now, does not mean I shall give up hope.","264609":"We didn't even get close, and yet I sense they are there, all of them.","264610":"We will not make the same mistakes other rescuers did.","264611":"We have the chance to save what otherwise might be lost to the ice forever.","264612":"This is a matter in which I have a deep personal interest.","264614":"Among the many others, my dearest Sir John, is lost to the ice.","264615":"Signs they were there? The search may begin in earnest!","264616":"The Faithful Expedition shall be the success that no other ever was.","264617":"We must be ready for all eventualities, this shall be no small endeavour.","264618":"The Inuit will know something, I intend to seek their insight at the earliest opportunity.","264619":"We should approach these preparations with clarity of purpose.","264620":"I dream of seeing us cut through the ice like a hot knife through butter!","264621":"I will not rest until the lost expedition are fed, bathed in hot salts and tucked up in their beds.","264622":"I can neglect not one supply that may prove useful in an icy wasteland.","264623":"We cannot underinvest in provisions and equipment.","264624":"We cannot rely on Inuit knowledge alone, we must have our own expertise.","264625":"We need the best minds to have any dream of succeeding.","264626":"The least I can save is my husband's reputation, if indeed he has found a northwest passage.","264627":"Glorious it is when wandering time comes.","264628":"If you walk on thin ice, you may as well dance.","264629":"Be the lead dog, and show where to go.","264630":"Find this seal hole.","264631":"Watch out for bears.","264632":"To ignore the wisdom of the Inuit is an arrogance we cannot afford.","264633":"The Arctic Council disregarded Inuit expertise and it got them nowhere!","264634":"The strong qimmiq pulls through.","264635":"You have a good nose.","264636":"It is easy to underestimate this place.","264637":"This is a harsh land.","264638":"We should do what we can to survive.","264639":"I am relieved not all misunderstand the Inuit as you do.","264640":"We should take gifts when they are offered.","264641":"We waste no chance we have here.","264642":"Now is your time.","264643":"That was only the beginning.","264644":"The day is young, there is more to do.","264645":"Do you share with the hunting party?","264646":"Should I heat some tea?","264647":"There is nothing more to be said.","264648":"It is a time of silence.","264649":"Temperatures will not favour us for long.","264650":"The Faithful Expedition is in dire need of that Icebreaker.","264651":"The Arctic Council thought breaking the ice impossible too, yet someone has clearly managed it!","264652":"It shows we have conquered our fear.","264653":"Seems the balance is restored.","264654":"These are good signs.","264655":"Let us show the Arctic Council we do not give up on anyone.","264656":"They underestimated the power of nature, but I cannot watch them be punished for it.","264657":"We cannot all hope to best the elements, as the council themselves are always keen to point out.","264658":"There is much to be afraid of now.","264659":"You have done well, and you smell nice.","264660":"You have damaged the balance of things.","264661":"When the ice breaks, I want you there with me.","264662":"The wolf has kept you strong, caribou.","264663":"I must consult the spirit now.","264664":"It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.","264665":"You are meddling in witchcraft.","264666":"You have let many people down.","264667":"A shaman must help those in need. We will share what we know.","264668":"We were afraid you would come for them. Now you are here we must help you.","264669":"To know where you are going, you have to know where you come from.","264670":"An annuraaq should be watertight.","264671":"A fur hood would help shake the snow from your face.","264672":"We do not camp anywhere long, the season changes fast.","264673":"The igluit are made with anything we can find.","264674":"During the long dark winter, we will play games and tell stories.","264675":"Seal is important to us, we are careful to waste no part of it.","264676":"Take only the whale and bear that you need.","264678":"We still have much to learn from the Inuit, if we are to succeed the next time.","264679":"I thought together we could do it, I hope one day I can still be proven right.","264680":"May we repay this kindness.","264681":"We are thankful.","264682":"Nakurmiik; thank you.","264683":"Yes.","264684":"Ee.","264685":"Good.","264686":"Not good.","264687":"I am sorry.","264688":"Nakka.","264689":"May you have warmth in your iglu.","264690":"May you have oil in your lamp.","264691":"Go with peace in your heart.","264692":"Coming here, I realise the frightening scale of what lies ahead of us.","264693":"The ice is as old as time, and more stubborn than I'd ever have believed.","264694":"Though it is their own expedition they abandon, the Arctic Council shows no sign of contrition.","264695":"I am more worried than ever for the wellbeing of my husband's crew.","264696":"The Council's hubris coming here, expecting the unconquerable to be conquered!","264697":"How underprepared we are for mother nature! Only a seasonal lull gives us any hope at all.","264698":"My husband is a stubborn man, I only hope he was not too proud to heed the Inuit.","264699":"We have broken through ancient Ice, can I yet be hopeful?","264700":"These narrow channels will thicken solid, if we wait any longer.","264701":"How can they have survived in such a pitiless climate?","264702":"What if their provisions failed? Surely then they'd have been grateful for seals from the Inuit?","264703":"It was the Arctic Council who chose my dearest John, for all his flaws.","264704":"My husband's preparations were meticulous, I only hope he was willing to adapt them.","264705":"What snow-monsters lie in wait, I dare not speculate.","264706":"We must bridge with the Inuit. Perhaps they would trade?","264707":"Our survival hinges on partnership with the Inuit, we must reach out to them somehow.","264709":"The blinding whiteness. I hope I shall be worthy of its grandeur.","264710":"Dinner with the admiralty, is my sum experience of the Arctic, yet now here I am.","264711":"Stone cairns, and signs they camped in this very spot!","264712":"An auspicious place for us to make camp, knowing they too were here.","264713":"We must set up some chain of supply here— who knows how long a search will take.","264714":"Any provisions or equipment we can find will be beneficial to us!","264716":"Are we too late? Is it too late for us too now?","264717":"We are close, I sense them; my John - all of them.","264718":"Follow their aura, as others have done, and we can still find them.","264742":"If it takes our last breath we must find those walkers!","264743":"There is nothing more to be done now, but await the fate of the others.","264744":"That howling! They must long to be found!","264745":"We must strive onward, if it be the end of us.","264746":"This is the end, we must give ourselves to it fully.","264749":"We must trust the visions of the Inuit, and hope.","264750":"They must have been desperate to forsake the comfort of their cabins.","264751":"That John was not among them matters not, my belief has returned that he roams the ice yet.","264752":"Where are the bodies, if they are all dead?","264753":"Better to find skulls, than nothing at all.","264754":"We should dignify their memory with burial.","264755":"What madness caused them to forsake their equipment?","264756":"New life already clings to the wreckage of the old.","264757":"I can hear them, see their light everywhere!","264758":"The pole star gleams on bone.","264759":"The northland calls us through its open gate.","264760":"It's as if we are on a different plane, where souls reside.","264761":"The Inuit spoke of souls, I think I understand now.","264762":"We must hold fast, the truth will embrace us soon.","264771":"Skins can be sewn into clothing with bone needles.","264772":"You need a lot of good fat to reach the heart of ice.","264773":"So many sacrifices, but we have brought the survivors home!","264774":"That so many lives have been saved gives me hope anew.","264775":"I fear they went looking for the heart of ice. We have not seen them for a long time.","264776":"I can set you on a path, the rest is down to you.","264777":"If you tread carefully, then perhaps a way can be found.","264778":"That is the way. Their breath still hangs in the air.","264779":"Without belief, answers do not yet exist.","264780":"I don't know if your icebreaker will vanquish the ice, but we will not stand in your way.","264781":"None of us have much time.","264782":"You need to make the best of all you have.","264783":"Such strength can redeem your people.","264784":"This place is all-powerful, ever-changing, you have to adapt.","264785":"We have sighted vessels stranded in the channels. They too will be lost without help.","264786":"Better to let others learn from their own mistakes.","264787":"Your countrymen will soon become snowbound, and easy prey for Akhlut.","264788":"Those men underestimated this place, but you can show them their failings.","264789":"They will be glad to come back to light and hospitality, and think on their mistakes.","264790":"Seals are everywhere; know how to look for them.","264791":"Nanurjuk says they didn't seem right. They said little as if their tongues were cut.","264792":"They refused the seals we offered them.","264793":"They would not trade, or drink soup with us.","264794":"We built them a shelter, but they were already gone, deep into the ice.","264795":"Never have I seen beings so pale.","264796":"They went beyond the old ice, to a place of danger.","264797":"We are afraid Anguta has taken them to the underworld.","264798":"There are many ways to survive here, we have learned since childhood.","264799":"I will trade with you.","264800":"We were scared they were possessed by demons.","264801":"They brought sickness with them, and devilry.","264802":"We knew you would come for them, we have been waiting for you.","264803":"If these are indeed humans you pursue, I will do all I can to help you.","264804":"There are many things I could tell you, but I don't think they will help.","264805":"There are many sea mammals here, Sedna is their keeper.","264806":"We do not meddle in the business of others.","264807":"Don't expect to learn everything in a day.","264808":"The Council have praised our knowledge, but never respected it.","264809":"The vessels you seek are near yet far. Best prepare for terror.","264810":"If their vessels drifted to a dark place, maybe they are there still.","264811":"They could not have escaped the channels, you will find them there.","264812":"We too want answers, you are brave to keep digging.","264813":"This is a place of death. You can die here without knowing.","264814":"I will not go with you. I hope it is men you find, at the end of your journey.","264815":"When wise men die, the heavens lament.","264816":"You are on the last floe now, but the most fragile.","264817":"You have brought men back from the edge, you have earned our respect.","264818":"If you cannot save them, their souls will be trapped in the upper world to starve for eternity.","264819":"The lights in the sky cleave heads from the unworthy.","264820":"Where the ice between the dead and the living is thinnest, you float across.","264821":"I have no power to protect you, when you go to that place.","264822":"You have stirred the wrath of the moon!","264823":"Do not hunt alone, in darkness, or the wolf will take you.","264824":"This is a celestial place, be wary of taboo.","264825":"Fear this place, or it will take you smiling.","264826":"Nanook decides if you may hunt, or if you violate this place.","264827":"Inuksuk said he saw the white people carrying human meat.","264828":"I remember they were so dirty, they had lost all humanity.","264829":"If you hear a whistling, it is their ghosts, trapped in the upper world.","264842":"I'm back from the dead, and I've brought friends.","264843":"Ain't you learned by now, I'm unkillable!","264844":"I decide when I die, thank you.","264845":"This time, I'm going to get in with the right people.","264846":"We've rebuilt before, we can do it again.","264847":"The past is the past, the future is ours to protect.","264848":"You're going to need your best ship and crew, only for it to sink to the icy bottom! Hehehe.","264849":"Terrible waste of human life of course, but don't let that stop you.","264850":"And be sure to prepare for the final curtain while you're at it.","264851":"You really do have quite the desire to depart don't ya? Well it's your funeral.","264852":"Never mind, eh! At least you won't die a block of ice.","264853":"Seems a long way to go to die, but you look ready for it.","264854":"Take your time, won't make a difference to Sir John.","264855":"Congratulations! You crossed seven seas for a wasteland!","264856":"Couldn't even shoot yerself in the foot? Well I feel sorry for ya.","264857":"The whole expedition's a failure. But we all know that teamwork drivel's a myth.","264858":"See— never worth getting mixed up in other people's business.","264859":"What a waste of time! Just goes to show, you can't rely on others.","264860":"There's nothing up there but the ruddy cold.","264861":"Hoping this will keep your head above water? Not Arctic water it won't.","264862":"Dunno why you're so desperate for your eyeballs to freeze.","264863":"At best we'll be pulling stiffs out the ice like teeth.","264864":"Like frostbite do ya? Botulism? Scurvy? Got that all to look forward to.","264865":"The Arctic's no more than a mariner's graveyard. Ooh, hang fire...","264866":"As we're here, we might ask the Inuits if they chanced upon any lost property...","264867":"The equipment won't have decomposed like the cadavers.","264868":"We've a responsibility to Sir John to gather up his valuables.","264869":"Hard to feel the cold when you see a glint, ain't it? Hehe.","264870":"Found nothing but emptiness, why isn't I surprised?","264871":"The deeper we go, the more likely we find something really juicy.","264872":"You want an Icebreaker, so we can get to the fancy stuff.","264873":"Never know what you'll find inside, if you don't crack things open.","264874":"Now we can finally see if Sir John bequeaths us summat shiny.","264875":"You need to grow yourself some tusks, my walrus-friend, or we'll never snag the goodies.","264876":"What d'you wanna help those old duffers for? Unless...you've sniffed summat out?","264877":"I've heard the Arctic Council ships are plushly furnished.","264878":"Shame they had to still be alive and we couldn't just help ourselves.","264879":"As long as their pocket watches still tick we should try afresh.","264880":"Never should o' come here, why do you think they call it a wasteland?","264881":"Looks like we'll have to dig up Sir John Faithful's army o' the dead another day.","264882":"Shame we couldn't find 'em, I was looking forward to expanding my collection of brass buttons.","264883":"Lady Faithful hopes to resurrect her marriage, but Sir John's got cold feet, hehehe.","264884":"Ice might even have helped preserve the merchandise.","264885":"I think we all know where Sir John Faithful is now, don't we? He's dead.","264886":"I know her old man’s long dead, but his lavish instruments won’t be, eh?","264887":"Don't be afraid to see the frozen look as you frisk their corpses, you’ll get used to it.","264888":"You can see a body a mile off out here, nice and exposed.","264889":"Knowing those old toffs, they'd probably skin each other before they'd skin a seal.","264890":"I 'spect there's a few nice bits and bobs suspended about the place.","264891":"Can't always wait til things are dead y'know...","264892":"No-one'll notice the odd body. If they're well-preserved, we could sell 'em for dissection.","264893":"Can't believe how much an Inuit'll give ya for a tarnished spoon, hehe.","264894":"I'd have come before, if I'd known how easy it is to fleece the locals.","264895":"If you're looking for the Hades and Styx, you're going in the right direction, hehe.","264896":"We can really milk this predicament for all it's got, as long as we're quiet.","264897":"Two years in a blizzard probably doesn't do your skin much good, does it?","264898":"Now, we don't want to look like we're only in it for the proceeds.","264899":"Now we're onto something. Let's hope for a shipwreck!","264900":"I hope those ships are stuck fast in the ice, free for the taking!","264901":"Ain't you wondering what's left of them ships?","264905":"Blimey, by foot!? This all looks very grim all of a sudden, doesn't it?!","264906":"Afraid? Never seen a real corpse?","264908":"If Lady Faithful thinks they're still alive let's humour the poor woman's delusion shall we?","264909":"Let's get to the bottom of this mystery, and what's become of 'em.","264910":"You'd think you'd seen a ghost, what's frozen yer?","264911":"Some of them live?! Brings a tear to an old man's eye.","264912":"Why d'you have to fade away before the final payoff!","264913":"Heavens what a name, no wonder their luck, eh?","264914":"You seem drawn to death, that's why I stick to you like fishglue.","264915":"This place is more indifferent to humankind than I am.","264916":"Cast your eyes about for any tidbits in the snow.","264917":"Lady Faithful's bewitched, she won't notice if we shuffle off for a bit.","264918":"A place so curious must have its curiosities…","264919":"What's all this endeavour of yours for?","264920":"A lot of furry animals out here.","264921":"These Inuit geezers are a help though, ain't they?","264922":"There are times even I give the dead their due.","264923":"Nothing but bone.","264924":"A sight to chill even someone as soulless as myself.","264925":"I think we could all use a tot of hot brandy.","264926":"Even I'd start to miss the sight of other beings out here.","264927":"We've come to a place of solitude.","264928":"I can't bear to watch you do this to yourself.","264929":"I thought you would end icebound too, but for your icebreaker.","264949":"Treading paths never trodden!","264950":"The thrill of discovering new horizons…!","264951":"Going on an adventure? Don't be scared if old Wibbly can also do it.","264970":"Help enough to demolish the larger ruins. Let's breathe some life into this place!","264971":"Father wouldn't have wanted us to sit on our hands while our one prospect was in such a state.","264972":"So let's gather our townsfolk and ask them to spruce the place up.","264973":"Mourning is eased, now we have others for company, sibling.","264974":"Your people are recovered, and desirous to proceed. Set them to it! We're going to need as much space as we can clear.","264976":"We must shelter the good, loyal people who have shown solidarity with our family.","264977":"We need every hand we can get if we are to expunge this debris.","264978":"It's been a hard day of labour for us all, we should cater to our tired, hungry people!","264979":"Let Uncle Edvard scoff. A modest island yes, but if you’re at all like Father, you’ll look beyond appearances.","264980":"Timber, very good. I’ll try not to think of the coffin.","264981":"He twists every article in his favour, at our and father’s expense!","264982":"It’s been a long, hard day. The people need to rest. And maybe wet their whistles.","264983":"What, still here? Establishing a rival company? On that dishevelled island?!","264984":"Do you remain here out of spite, or is this some futile attempt at competition?","264985":"Samuel's child, is it? Thank Heavens! I am so ashamed of every single word your uncle had me print.","264988":"You have father’s fortitude! These people will follow you as they once followed him.","264989":"We have to set personal feelings aside and do as Edvard asks.","264990":"Speak to our humble cousin! He writes of a worker riot in Bright Sands.","264991":"It seems we are not alone in our contempt for Edvard.","264994":"Even I am astonished he could be this corrupt. We must put their cases before the highest authority, and hope for a retrial.","264995":"I am so relieved our legitimacy is no longer in question.","264997":"Hurry, I already smell the tar, see the masts a-swaying from father’s study!","264998":"Is there no limit to Uncle's shameless demands?","264999":"I feel sick to the stomach that Edvard could ask so much of us so soon after father's death.","265000":"Miserly, uncharitable… dastard! Picking and choosing what he inherits!","265002":"It cannot be...these names are those father trusted most; barristers, doctors, academics.","265003":"However much we despise Uncle Edvard, it's criminal to go opening his private correspondence!","265004":"He certainly knows how to silence his critics.","265005":"A letter. It bears Edvard’s seal!","265007":"As you are so desperate to appear responsible, you’ll be pleased to hear the cost of that fantastical funeral falls to you.","265008":"Your worthless rags have barely covered anything. Now bring me sails— it's not like you have any use for them!","265009":"Repay me now, or sell up!","265010":"Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, four bags full.","265011":"Good kid. Go on now, I'll let you know when I think of the next thing.","265012":"Don’t think you're finished, brat.","265019":"Haven't seen a prison transport of mine, have you? If you do, be sure to return any salvage to me.","265021":"Don't even think about sheltering Samuel’s co-conspirators! Deliver them to prison at once, and I might lift your debt.","265022":"You have seen sense then. I suppose I shall have to inform Sir Archibald that your obligations are met.","265023":"Feels an eternity since the funeral— and the cost! Why it was extortionate!","265024":"I loathe the reek of lanolin, but if farmers smocks are all you have...","265025":"That was none of your business! And what right has the crown to meddle in my accounts? What right?!","265026":"Debt free? Spiffing, just the dib-dab. One splendid licence we shall draw up forthwith.","265027":"As to the debt, my hands are tied — but it may warm her majesty's heart to see a new enterprise taking shape.","265028":"Did he really…? Oh dear, best leave these poor people with me. I will tell Edvard that the debt between you is quite settled…","265029":"If you pick me, you may have my boat! It's my poor aunt's legacy. Her second husband was a decent sailor.","265030":"Everybody on board? Good! I shiver at the thought of staying here another second…","265031":"Our city's historic first shipyard! We must document this moment in our first edition!","265032":"The perfect snapshot to illustrate history-in-the-making!","265033":"With several passionate young reporters enlisted, our publishing house is already well-underway!","265034":"Our editorial section is sure to grow along with your city. We are fine-tuning the first issue as we speak!","265035":"Think turning in sinners maketh you an angel? I know all about your family.","265036":"We’d rather die than stay. Our flags still wave for Samuel, let Edvard oppress us no more!","265037":"A life away from Edvard? We're on board! Only… we've no ship to get on board of!","265038":"We are, all of us, quite moved by your selfless actions. Your father would be proud.","265039":"Saved! Do you also then save us from a grievous injustice…?","265040":"Edvard’s charges against us are pure fabrication! The man is an impostor!","265041":"See what slander Edvard prints in Bright Sands!","265043":"The start of, if I dare presume, a most fruitful partnership!","265050":"Clearly Uncle's intention is to keep us from ever owning a shipyard.","265053":"Our dream of a shipyard is impossible without plenty of qualified hands.","265054":"Workers can handle stubborn debris on Ditchwater. If it's to be the centre of our new enterprise it needs to be immaculate.","265055":"Maybe Edvard will try to prevent us owning a shipyard, but for now let's at least house those workers.","265056":"Open the letter, he's clearly up to no good!","265061":"What is it you are bringing?","265062":"Hmm, a delivery? Dead or alive?","265063":"We are running low on timber, but there's plenty in the ruins. We should clear some to stock up.","265064":"Where are my sails!?","265125":"Done.","265127":"Screenshot taken.","265129":"Seriously? You're cheating?","265130":"For your information.","265131":"Game saved.","265133":"Praise checksum nine! Today is Anno day!","265134":"Will you be my Valentine?","265135":"Happy Easter!","265136":"Happy Holidays!","265137":"Merry Christmas!","265138":"Happy Halloween!

I was just taking a pause.","265437":"The non-aggression pact has ended!","265438":"The Imperial Event is about to end.","265439":"You have received a donation.","265440":"Your donation request has expired.","265491":"My father died in a mine.","265492":"Ah, the sound of cash registers and the smell of freshly printed money...!","265493":"Astounding! Can you teach me about this new invention?","265494":"Progress, for the everyday folk.","265495":"I admire the beauty of artificial light, the sweet humming of lanterns in the evening haze.","265496":"A big fancy do? Will there be magicians?","265498":"The whole world will want to come to the opening ceremony.","265499":"A special edition for a special happening - this makes everybody happy.","265514":"Seems like you two are getting along!","265515":"Isn't it nice when people are pleasant to one another?","265516":"It makes me sad to know my friends are being deceived.","265517":"And they say I can be pleasant with anyone…","265518":"There's good in everyone, but here I must look hard to see it…","265519":"You're not trying to trick people, are you?","265520":"Why can't we all just be friends?","265521":"It would be wrong not to stand by my companion in this.","265522":"I don't normally like dishonesty...","265523":"You can't please everyone. Believe me, I've tried.","265524":"Sometimes it's hard not to let one's feeling show....","265525":"As long as there's nothing criminal involved.","265526":"I too am a close friend","265527":"Birds of a feather…","265528":"A serpent under my friend's pillow…","265529":"My parents put their faith in the wrong place too…","265530":"You know a person by the friends they choose.","265531":"The Empress admires your subtlety.","265532":"I suppose you cannot see their admirable qualities…","265533":"Among friends, it is better to remain cordial.","265534":"You shame yourself at the house of my friend.","265535":"Weeds should not be watered.","265536":"Why tend a dead tree?","265537":"The Empress is impressed by your methods.","265538":"And it was Willie what brought you two together!","265539":"I've never had a group of friends before!","265540":"You're spooking me mates…","265541":"What plot are you hatching?","265542":"You don't plan on coming for me, or…?","265543":"Time someone who deserves it was haunted!","265544":"Leave my friend alone!","265545":"So I'm not the only one you bully.","265546":"Stop creeping up on everybody!","265547":"I wish I could stand up to them like that.","265548":"Teach 'em a lesson!","265549":"My little apprentice, now a master of shadows!","265550":"Mutual sincerity puts me at ease.","265551":"I thought not all people shared our values!","265552":"Don't expose my friends to your shady ethics!","265553":"You're a hypocrite!","265554":"I don't tolerate fawners!","265555":"Immoral tactics for the immoral, hmmn?","265556":"I hope I didn't hear that correctly about my friend.","265557":"That's my friend, you ill-mannered youth.","265558":"Dishonest with my allies! Shameful!","265559":"They've earned no kindness.","265560":"Not everyone deserves respect.","265561":"You brought them to justice, in a way.","265562":"You two are so sweet together.","265563":"Maybe you could both come for tea and one biscuit.","265564":"You can slip under me friend's nose, but not mine.","265565":"That's a funny choice for a friend!","265566":"Some friends are trouble.","265567":"I'm not one to judge!","265568":"I don't like to see my friends hurt.","265569":"A bad temper won't help anyone, you least of all.","265570":"You don't want to be playing this game with friends of Beryl…","265571":"That should sour their milk.","265572":"No-one likes them anyway!","265573":"Yer can skulk up their drainpipe all you like.","265574":"Our friends are our stepping stones.","265575":"We stand astride the shoulders of our friends.","265576":"Creeping up my esteemed friend's stair.","265577":"You are rubbing up the wrong balustrade.","265578":"Forming a little clique?","265579":"A concealed antechamber in the house of your enemy.","265580":"Don't make ripples in the pond!","265581":"My friends all have a lot of influence on the scene.","265582":"Be careful where you cast your shadow…","265583":"I too find them barbaric.","265584":"So you heard they were one of my critics?","265585":"Important to seek new perspectives on one's rivals...","265586":"You rub shoulders with the elite.","265587":"You have to butter some muffins on the way to the top.","265588":"Partridge-napper! That is my secret tunnel!","265589":"Look at you worms tangling in the mud.","265590":"I don't like them, and I don't like you.","265591":"It would be naive not to keep an eye on them.","265592":"You humiliate yourself publicly!","265593":"It doesn't suit you to mingle with the upper crust.","265594":"Imagine! Living a life of duplicity!","265595":"Yes, there can only be one showmaster!","265596":"I love to see others squabbling among themselves.","265597":"Everyone's doing it, are they not?","265598":"Isn't friendship great?","265599":"We are getting along so well!","265600":"Will I tell them I've seen you lurking?","265601":"It makes me angry, watching you two frolic.","265602":"What you are doing with them hurts me.","265603":"I like your furtiveness!","265604":"It's damaging us both.","265605":"Cut them out, and I cut you out.","265606":"I make friends so as to kill them, don't you slither in!","265607":"Why not, let's skin them together!","265608":"Yes, bad people! Naughty people!","265609":"A snake? I go for the jugular myself.","265610":"Strong allies are the key to success.","265611":"We all need people we can trust.","265612":"The least honourable strategy toward my allies…","265613":"I was wrong to think we shared a common foe.","265614":"I think you are confused as to who your friends are.","265615":"I don't blame you for watching your back around them.","265616":"A pretty poor gambit to irk my allies.","265617":"A weak move, that's my ally.","265618":"Cowards go behind friend's backs.","265619":"A pincer movement!","265620":"Yes, an attack on two fronts!","265621":"Our enemy's ranks will crumble from within.","265622":"I always think a narrow selection of friends is better.","265623":"A closely-knit circle, aren't we?","265625":"Choose friends carefully.","265626":"Don't sugar everyone's tea.","265628":"Friends and foes may often be confused.","265629":"That was my friend, you know.","265631":"Dear child, people bring it upon themselves.","265632":"Oh yes, no need to save face.","265634":"We aren't friends, we're allies.","265635":"Us against the world!","265636":"You don't want to mess with Anne's mates.","265637":"Your politics sicken me.","265638":"You lot and your etiquette.","265639":"We like a traitor.","265640":"I stick by my recruits you know.","265641":"Yer a real dog, aren't ya?","265642":"Come for me next then, and I'll nut yer.","265643":"Harsh! I like that!","265644":"An enemy's enemy and all that.","265645":"Skulduggery is second nature to us.","265646":"There are not many I can call friends.","265647":"If we people of principle don't support each other…","265648":"Hey, I'll play the trickster around here…","265649":"Hypocrisy is the only language the privileged speak.","265650":"Are you done kissing their feet?","265651":"Now that is a very clever thing indeed!","265652":"Do you need a lesson in manners from a pirate?","265653":"Well, that was rude.","265654":"At least try to keep your cards close to your chest!","265655":"I bet that will sting for days.","265656":"Wish I could have seen their face.","265657":"Please, don't let me stop you!","265713":"Something must have been lost in translation…","265715":"Fancy fighting with an old gent like George.","265716":"But Beryl has always been so kind to me...","265719":"The world has been nothing but cruel to Alonso.","265721":"Poor lady Margaret, hasn't she been through enough in her life…?","265725":"You'll soon discover Princess Qing regales the most fascinating tales!","265727":"George will say he doesn't want any help, but please take good care of him.","265728":"Beryl's tea parties are always a very great comfort!","265731":"I am so glad you've seen Alonso's gentle side.","265733":"I always worry about dear old Maggs, good to know she has a friend.","265736":"I cannot fathom waging war against Miss Jorgensen…","265746":"It is right to oppose the dishonest.","265747":"I don't like pirates either.","265748":"Bente is a wonderful friend.","265758":"You too enter a sea of corruption.","265759":"Mother insists rebellion is wrong.","265760":"Hey, leave Bente alone, alright?","265764":"If Beryl's anything like mum, you're dead meat!","265770":"Good, I hate those spooky, scary pirates!","265771":"Teach them pirates not to come for Willie at night!","265772":"Hey! I saw her first!","265776":"Ah, Beryl! She always loves it when I make myself disappear!","265782":"You're in league with pirate Annie! Eurgh, stay away!","265783":"You do know Fortune is against the crown?","265784":"Fighting Miss Jorgensen?!","265795":"One more opposing the struggle for independence?","265796":"Your trust in Bente makes me want to trust you.","265807":"At least you're sympathetic to the struggle for independence.","265808":"Miss Jorgensen has a lot of friends, you know.","265810":"Pick a fight with someone your own size!","265814":"Oh don't you rough-up lovely old Carl! All fat an sweaty in his suit!","265820":"Ah, I know, she's lovely.","265822":"Funny how endearing that dimwit can be.","265826":"Then I'm not the only one who sees something in him?","265832":"Who would go against a goddess?!","265835":"George is a man of refinement!","265838":"Show him some culture, will you?","265844":"The mother, cradling the child.","265847":"George is the second most cultured person I know.","265850":"A boorish pair of hangers-on.","265856":"How dare you assail the noble Bente!","265858":"About time someone crunched that locust!","265860":"You know, that filthy sewer rat has a mean bite.","265868":"You too would like her favour, eh?","265870":"Two feathered twits bumping around the same coop.","265872":"Her sordid dynasty is somehow worthy of credit, isn't it?","265880":"Don't think you can have her skull…","265881":"Then the prows of your ships point east.","265882":"Yes, I can't wait for him to die.","265883":"Him? He's almost passed over already!","265884":"Skewer her little urchins on toothpicks!","265885":"Burn the false prophet to the ground!","265886":"Perhaps you can bury him alive in gold.","265888":"Perhaps you can pin another medal on him, eh?","265889":"And keep a lid on her ashes so she can't remanifest.","265890":"Those teenage tantrums must end some day!","265891":"Let's see who has the better luck.","265892":"My two favourite birds now sit invitingly on the same perch.","265911":"Alonso can be defeated by watertight strategy.","265913":"A worthy adversary. I wish you luck.","265915":"Independence fighters—they are traitors to be executed!","265923":"Allying with Graves takes things beyond unstable…","265925":"Then Hunt has gotten herself a new puppet…","265927":"Allying with the freedom pirate!? Incredible.","265935":"A feral beast to be trussed and neutered.","265936":"We cannot allow La Corona to gain influence, can we?","265938":"Don't trouble yourself with such lowly enemies.","265947":"Raise flags with a lunatic? Unthinkable!","265948":"La Corona is a rival to my poor dear Queen.","265950":"Perhaps you can help the silly pariah.","265979":"George supported me, so I support him!","265984":"Make him suffer as he made my people suffer.","265991":"George is an ally you can rely on.","265996":"If you support Silva, you support La Corona.","266021":"A war with Auntie Maggs? Ohoho, you're done for!","266033":"Oh, Auntie Maggs'll look after you alright.","266111":"We are failing!","266112":"Change is very slow!","266113":"We are trying our hardest!","266114":"It's a real struggle.","266115":"We are empty-handed!","266116":"Nowhere near our goal.","266117":"We have fallen far behind.","266146":"Is not my fault, eh!","266147":"Not enough, ya sé.","266148":"One of the worst years I can remember.","266149":"Something's gone wrong!","266150":"Believe me, we're trying.","266156":"I can't blame the machines!","266157":"Calculations are severely amiss!","266158":"What is the reason for this failure?!","266159":"We must revisit the manual at once!","266160":"Operation should have been simple!","266161":"I am a failure!","266162":"May as well finish me.","266163":"Nothingness.","266164":"I'm a useless donkey.","266165":"I've always been a dunce!","266166":"This production is cat-lap!","266167":"It's a right old bag o' nails.","266168":"If nothing works, might as well have stayed at home.","266169":"I won't be the scapegoat for this.","266170":"There's a whoppin' spanner in the works.","266171":"Fields fallow and barren.","266172":"I blame the soil.","266173":"A bad 'arvest","266174":"We're scrapin' the bottom of the barrel.","266175":"It's a snail's pace.","266176":"Some sort o' blight on us!","266177":"Land must be cursed!","266178":"If this place were a racehorse, you'd shoot it.","266179":"All I produce is tears.","266180":"This place is a void!","266181":"We would be better off with cave tools!","266182":"It does not yet function well.","266183":"The earth has given up on us.","266184":"It's looking pretty slim.","266189":"The board have faith in you to pull through, here's something to keep the fires burning.","266197":"A commission for the Royal fleet! And in such quantity! A rare honour indeed!","266198":"I find myself looking up to you, as the youngest often will.","266199":"So you build ships like your father? Well, the Queen is in the direst need of ships.","266200":"Supporting her will go some way to healing the wounds of the past.","266201":"These reinforcements will please Her Majesty! Though it remains my hope no war will be necessary.","266202":"The weaponry they ask for presents a problem. I'm not even sure we have an iron lode, do we?","266203":"Still have a few sticks of dynamite! We can blow our way through!","266204":"Ah, he’s here! Try to make a good first impression, eldest; any friend of father is a friend of ours.","266205":"Father used Mr. Ticker on account of his good sense. Go on, I suggest you find him in Bright Sands.","266206":"What are you both doing?! Demolition is a serious matter, wanting proper expertise!","266207":"I see the iron is beyond our reach. We have no choice but to find a way through the mountain.","266208":"Mr. Ticker has opened my eyes to the world of controlled destruction!","266209":"Perhaps not refined enough for your sister, but at least your workers can start their dig.","266210":"There was a chance while yer father still lived, no use dragging it out now he's gone…","266211":"Bright Sands will never be matched, if that's what you're set on.","266212":"You are trying at least. I know Samuel wouldn't have given up.","266213":"I'm starting to wonder if you can't turn things around.","266214":"You can't bring back your father, but his spirit…","266215":"I knew all along Father could never have taken his own life. But that someone willfully took his...!","266216":"The foul scent of a killer. We cannot let him escape.","266217":"Someone supplies the murderer from Madame Kahina's harbour? We should investigate.","266218":"I don't know what you're trying to achieve here, but it won't bring Samuel back.","266219":"Mining for you, mining for Eli , what's the difference?","266220":"Your father had that same steely look.","266221":"It's no Bright Sands, but it really is something!","266222":"Your company is flourishing. You may even be the match of your father, rest his soul.","266223":"Samuel Goode’s engineer? Aye, that’s me. Who’s asking?","266224":"Iron into Steel, Steel into Arms and we shall have fulfilled our first Royal commission!","266225":"There is no shame in producing weapons if it is in defence of the realm, eldest.","266226":"So I'm a commodity now, to be bought and sold? Your father treated me like a human being.","266227":"He is ready for transportation.","266228":"The locals say that trading ship over there belongs to a stranger. Maybe that's the supplier!","266229":"I can't think why he'd be worth anything. Everyone here is beyond redemption…","266230":"I'm not going to tell you your father wasn't a traitor.","266231":"I'd do anything to dodge Mr. Bleakworth's treadmill, but no, I'm not your expert.","266232":"Forget escape - and to what, Edvard's new vision for Bright Sands?","266233":"Brought here along with Samuel, none of us knowing why.","266234":"The way Mr. Bleakworth treats us, I don't blame your father for bowing out with his dignity.","266235":"Traitor or not, Samuel wouldn't have wanted his people to suffer for it.","266236":"Demolition? I could demolish a proper breakfast.","266237":"I was made to scrub Mr. Bleakworth's scabby back once.","266238":"Mr. Bleakworth conducts every lashing himself.","266240":"He freely admits to his crime! Get him!","266241":"No, he is dead! It cannot end here, we have no answers!","266242":"It is father's diary! Quickly, what does he say!?","266243":"Of course, the island over which he was accused of treason! That is what they are after.","266246":"The diary may not be enough in itself to convince Sir Archibald, but it may give him food for thought.","266247":"No doubt father thought this symbol germane. If anyone can interpret it, Madame Kahina can.","266248":"There must be some clue among the wreckage, anything!","266249":"It's empty!","266250":"Endless cloaks and masks!","266251":"Maggot-ridden!","266252":"An assortment to make the blood curdle!","266253":"The mark of the Pyrphorians. This sign of fire is reserved for those they wish death upon.","266254":"I never knew your father was mixed up with the Pyrphorians—a grave malevolence.","266255":"You may be wild, child, but don’t go to the new world, don’t rouse the dragon from its slumber.","266256":"I had believed it would only do harm to tell you, but I have grounds to believe your father was murdered.","266257":"And the killer, his cellmate, walks free! The rumour is he's in hiding, preparing to flee to the New World.","266258":"It is believed his accomplice supplies him with goods from the Emporium Exotique!","266259":"Who have we here?! Samuel Goode's child! Want to go down with your father, do you?","266260":"Sarmento's last location is all we have. We need to plan our expedition route carefully.","266261":"This symbol is a death threat?! But Her Majesty received one identical! Upon a plain envelope, with a stamp from the colonies!","266262":"We still don't know how your father was involved in all this, but I fear the answer lies west.","266263":"Your father sold Prosperity to the leader of the rebels Isabel Sarmento.","266264":"Ever since the deal, Isabel has been hiding from us. But you may be the one to find her.","266265":"You're too late. I was just a spark, and the touch-paper is already lit...","266271":"The horsemen are coming!","266272":"You're going to need your Sunday clothes!","266274":"I'm in a daze…","266275":"Mamá, I am hungry…","266276":"Ah the old days…","266277":"Impossible!","266278":"Is the sun getting hotter!?","266279":"El infierno…","266280":"This is more hole than it is shoe.","266281":"It's better in the shade…","266282":"Señor, señor! A letter.","266283":"Ugh, I thought it was just mud…","266284":"I'd like something cold…","266285":"¿Qué tal está usted?","266286":"We could use some rain.","266287":"Was I asleep that long?","266288":"Padre, can we go a la playa?","266290":"The world feels alive today.","266292":"It's so good to be en casa!","266293":"Canta y no llores, sing, don't you cry!","266294":"I wish mi mamá could see this.","266295":"Qué maravilla…","266296":"¡Vivan los novios!","266297":"Here, have a good drink, paca.","266302":"Spare a coin, amigo?","266303":"Your baby is so lindo!","266304":"A chick who abandons her nest!","266305":"¡Ole!","266306":"Smiles light up her chubby face!","266307":"The sea view never fails to calm me.","266308":"¡Es el paraíso…!","266309":"I hear the ocean singing…","266310":"Living like an old-world queen!","266311":"¡Bienvenidos! Makes yourselves at home!","266312":"There's the good, the bad, and the ugly…","266313":"We're in transition – you have to understand.","266314":"Niños, don't run around!","266315":"Is your tío feeling better?","266316":"Of course, you can eat some of mine.","266317":"Godspeed, mi buen señor.","266318":"Well, fool's gold is better than no gold!","266319":"The flag is full of holes you can poke your hand through.","266320":"This time, we leave at first light!","266321":"Madre, why can't we go outside?","266322":"The dream is dying.","266323":"Nobody cleans these streets?","266324":"Remember La Corona? It's almost that bad.","266325":"The past casts long shadows...","266326":"Is it… safe to be quite this close?","266327":"I admit it's charming when they nuzzle.","266328":"What can be the purpose of those markings?","266329":"Wildly exciting, but I'm starting to feel peckish.","266330":"Doesn't it look a bit emaciated to you?","266331":"I'm fortunate enough to have seen these in the wild.","266332":"Surely, if they can jump that high, they…","266333":"I expected them to be larger in the flesh.","266334":"Come on, children, it's time to go.","266335":"We could bypass these…?","266336":"It says not to touch! Gracious...","266337":"Is there a label to indicate what it is?","266338":"I feel my faculties mildly advance.","266339":"I feel a certain kinship with our forefathers...","266340":"Curious, certainly.","266341":"Could look nice in our drawing room.","266342":"They say she sold seashells by the sea shore.","266343":"Aha…! How distinctive...","266344":"Oh, is there more?","266345":"Perfect for a rainy afternoon.","266346":"And they say piracy's dying!","266347":"I'd go off the edge of the world for her.","266348":"Arrgh!","266349":"Drink up lad.","266350":"Show me that map…","266351":"Aye, scimitar's a good blade.","266352":"Live as if tomorrow will be your last!","266353":"...then she hit him so hard, he spat out his teeth.","266354":"…the jellyfish took the Queen's pardon.","266355":"We can recruit more souls down south.","266356":"Aye, a yellowed stump's all that's left of it…","266357":"Hey! I've got the curlier beard!","266358":"D'you remember doubloons?","266359":"She's no silk stocking. That world is dead to Annie now.","266360":"Stop hogging the rum, or Annie'll hear of it!","266361":"Whenever I see fire, I'm afraid.","266362":"We believe in Isabel.","266363":"An idea cannot be destroyed.","266364":"¡Esta tierra es nuestra!","266365":"Even if we are on the run…","266366":"Ever feel you're being watched?","266367":"Couldn't sleep, too sticky.","266368":"More bullets? Let's hope we don't need them.","266369":"Always be ready, eh? Good girl.","266370":"Don't question Isabel, bobo!","266371":"She is a beacon radiating hope.","266372":"My cousin still rots in a La Corona jail…","266373":"Never know who's behind those masks.","266374":"Isabel will guide us to liberation!","266375":"It's our principles that set us apart, sister.","266376":"Isabel will never surrender.","266377":"It's better to know if something is wrong.","266378":"You never know if, or when they'll come for you.","266379":"Not all cults are creepy, but the Pyrphorians...!","266380":"Sometimes I see torches on the move at night.","266382":"Dynamite fishing?! You're serious? Well, the village north is always short on food.","266383":"Remember when we escaped the pits back when? Still some dynamite left...","266384":"I hid it next to the abandoned lighthouse. Go fetch it!","266385":"Here it is! Just get plenty of distance on the throw.","266386":"The dynamite is at the lighthouse, old pal.","266387":"They're not expecting Queen Parrotfish; anything with fins will do.","266388":"All the blistered fish they could ever want.","266389":"A long sea journey won't make me give up my vow to stick by you.","266390":"I owe my life to you. You go, I follow, until I decide the debt is paid.","266391":"You never told me you had a sister, what else haven't you told me about?","266392":"Sometimes you have to face the past to have a future.","266393":"A bird with a spear would be faster.","266394":"You’re just destroying coral, you clown.","266395":"You couldn’t hit a cow’s arse with a sitar.","266396":"Even more roasted fish!","266397":"Still trying to get used to that smell of char.","266398":"You do have an eye for opportunity. After all, it’s not TNT the locals are short of.","266399":"Are we leaving on a packet ship, or has the wind blown through your ears again?","266400":"If it's you lighting the fuse, I'm going to keep well back.","266401":"Must be plenty of fish in this bay.","266402":"Don't look at me—dynamite was your idea.","266404":"With that first bang I knew it was you! So come show me what you got this time!","266405":"Ah! That burnt reek! Ugh! Hand over whatever it is and I'll help you get rid of it.","266406":"Here are your tickets. Hurry, drifters! The boat is leaving soon. And nobody wants you to miss it.","266407":"Fuera! I told you drifters before, rum don’t grow on trees.","266408":"When are you layabouts going to get a job?","266409":"What the chimichurri was that boom?","266410":"So loud the church bell is ringing!","266415":"Of course there is! I told you, we’re late!","266416":"No, only in 2D! They went and splurged the entire emergency budget on sausages for the Anno Union.","266417":"Are you crazy? No! We see this through! And stop calling me Tanya, I’m Bente—stay in character!","266418":"Ladies and Gentlemen! A very warm welcome to the dress rehearsal of \"\"The Jørgensens - The Musical\"\"'","266419":"Nope. I gave the libretto some welcome revision last night.","266420":"—And what, grandpa? Get with the program. The Anno series has its best moments behind it. The Jørgensens, on the other hand, are rising stars in the strategy universe. Rumour has it Ubisoft already plans a whole new franchise, with me at the helm.","266421":"How many times? It’s Bente, not Tanya, thickie!","266422":"With the teensy difference that we lack the pink tutu.","266423":"Too much info!","266424":"Shut up!","266425":"I think we get it.","266426":"We did. when archie says her majesty he means…","266427":"You are the nine / The only one / Without whom / We would feel so small","266428":"I did not believe / Thought it was a ruse / took for blasphemy / the obvious truth.","266429":"To be honest, none, your majesty.","266430":"Who, or rather what, are you?","266431":"I’m sorry Nathaniel, but in this condition it is impossible for you to take part.","266432":"No, just no.","266433":"You’re telling me! An evening of anno takes forever. Luckily most of us fast forward.","266434":"Just fast forward!","266435":"They all fast forward!","266436":"We fast forward, and forward…","266437":"Oh what now?!","266438":"No portrait, nothing, only a colour? He is not allowed to join!","266439":"You are player blue, / But no-one really gets to know you","266440":"This is getting ridiculous.","266441":"Shut it!","266442":"Damn thing!","266443":"It’s much too soon for me to be through!","266444":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266445":"How do you both look?","266446":"Oh, that! I like to wear it in private.","266447":"Poppycock! Don’t be such a prude. How do you know I haven’t been wearing a tutu all along? You only ever see my top half in-game.","266448":"What does everyone have against mein tutu? I think it’s time you all took stock... / I hereby solemnly confess: / I wear a pink tutu / From late at night till morning dew / I wear a pink tutu / I wear a pink tutu. / Yes, thank heaven above! / Avoid me, belittle me / but oh how it flatters me / And it fits like a glove. / I wear a pink tutu. / In contempt of my character rules / When I appear, It’s true / I wear most certainly / Something beneath made of tulle / I wear a pink tutu. / So before you begin to pooh-pooh / take time to scrutinise / please try to recognise / That I wear a tutu","266449":"No I refuse to be quiet / Now everything’s out in the light / If in the loading screen, the harbour, / or in the trading menu / forever I’ll wear a tutu!","266450":"Good, then we can begin.","266451":"I did not know the queen was part of this. I thought we cut that witch out?","266452":"Oh golly-gosh, the nine!","266453":"quite feeble and small","266454":"The magic lies in the checksum","266455":"I thought we looked shit!","266456":"Nothing personal chum, but you look unspeakable.","266457":"No!","266458":"A shame he has taken it so badly. He thinks anno is so boring—he was really looking forward to the musical.","266459":"He simply clicks fast forward!","266460":"Then he fasts forward!","266461":"They all fast forward!","266462":"We fast forward, and forward…","266463":"No, wait. Something’s wrong. The lighting should be different somehow. The sun should be…","266464":"Where’s the ambulance?","266465":"No name to set things straight / The concept is rather hard to relate","266466":"Anyone have a light?","266467":"No! mein tutu! / Oh horror! Oh pain! / All we see is made of paper!","266468":"All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?","266469":"All of it burns, my pink tutu!","266470":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266471":"ME! You said it worm, kneel before the one true god of anno!","266472":"/ 1800 / 1602 / In every game / I shelter you / 1701 / 1404 / Each anno game / Is just the same","266473":"Enough of your grovelling! Rise Mortals! / Now, which role do you see for me in your little drama?","266474":"Your attempts at flattery are futile. I am going to pwn a game of 1404 now. When I get back this will be “checksum 9: the musical” or you will feel my holy wrath.","266475":"The moral of the story is simple. Without me, it doesn’t work. See you in Anno 1305!","266476":"There you are. I thought you may have begun without me.","266477":"But… I’m Old Nate! don’t you recognise me?","266478":"Don’t do this to me! You know how I love musicals.","266479":"I know, / a lowly intern painted me / And he was badly paid / I know / I have no proper face / And now I look like a disgrace / I know / A lowly intern cobbled me / The team just stood and laughed. / I know / for colour there’s no money in the purse / And the midday sun / ensures I look ten times worse","266480":"Please say, that i am “in”. / My heart it breaks in twain. / And If, I cannot sing, woe! / What will I do then, oh? / Come now, shake my hand!","266481":"Yeah / I saw the whole thing coming / Now it’s time for me to go. / Dear mother she was a sketching book / And even she loathes how I look","266482":"Oh… there’s already someone out there!","266483":"How do you look? I’d presumed we would be fully rendered here…","266484":"Darnation! I always said this union business was a nonsense! And that we are to look shabby-chic because of it?! Whatever next, my dear Tanya? Shall we abandon it all?","266485":"Not \"Anno 1800 - The Musical\", then?!'","266486":"Er...I’m not sure if her Majesty would approve. Perhaps over tea at the palace we could discuss your designs and—","266487":"Oh dear Tanya, please can we stick to…","266488":"Equally as flat as you are.","266489":"But we are not in private! You are here in the role of Anno-A.I! Carl Leonard von Malching—ill-tempered industrialist!","266490":"One moment, her majesty has not arrived yet.","266491":"quite feeble and small","266492":"The magic lies in the checksum","266493":"We could never have dared hope you would participate in so irreverent a trifle.","266494":"To be honest, no…","266495":"No!","266496":"But the game is jolly boring. Half the time I’m asleep before anyone discovers my island!","266497":"When your ship has you snoring / When the waiting is boring / I click fast forward!","266498":"Is my island warehouse bare? / Is that just too hard to bear? / then I fast forward!","266499":"Simply just fast forward!","266500":"We fast forward, and forward…","266501":"I think the sun is burned-out.","266502":"You don’t recognise it? I jest not, this is how we looked in 1602.","266503":"Oh so true! It’s far too much blue!","266504":"Oh horror! Oh pain! / Who came up with this stupid play!?","266505":"All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?","266506":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266508":"Did someone call for me?","266509":"So it’s my fault again?","266510":"What should I be?! Say it! What is it this time? Should I hang lower in the sky? Should I turn with you? If I ever make it into the game without one person complaining I’ll eat my hat. Come on then you bright sparks, gift me an entry in the options menu, this wheelie-bin for half-finished features. Or even better! How about a day-night cycle, huh? Then every five minutes I can cede my throne to a rotten cheese!","266511":"Peeps, in the old days nobody needed that. The world was in 2D. Everybody was happy that they could see anything at all.","266512":"If only father were here, he'd have known what to do.","266515":"It is not nearly as moribund here as it was.","266516":"Those still loyal to Father will now turn to you.","266517":"A moving tribute to see so many loyal to father trust in you.","266518":"At such times it is good to occupy oneself with routine things.","266519":"I'm sure you know, but father was innocent.","266520":"We must behave as if father were acquitted, as one day he will be.","266521":"Aarhant is proving wise counsel. I'm glad you managed to make a friend while you were away.","266522":"In times such as these, it is good to have people around us.","266523":"I'll dream of Bright Sands until the day I can dream no more.","266524":"A cloud still hangs over this place, please make it go away!","266525":"She has you doing all those chores you tried to leave behind.","266526":"Everything depends on this enterprise for your sister, I won't watch you let her down.","266527":"You're better with humankind than I used to believe.","266528":"First the weather, now the people!","266529":"It is not rain, but wet mist! And endless! What are we doing here?!","266530":"Disrespectful chatter abounds about your father and how he died.","266531":"Sometimes feels like your sister hardly knows you.","266532":"The tin rush left this island ugly.","266533":"Funny to watch you get your hands dirty.","266534":"So serious all of a sudden. Where’s that old spirit of yours gone?","266535":"You'll not have a dribble of inheritance after all your frivolity out in god-knows-where.","266536":"Prosperity's sale is a disaster for the Empire, the Queen has said as much to me herself!","266537":"Prosperity, sold to New World rebels, can you imagine?!","266538":"Did you expected a fatted calf to be slaughtered on your return?","266539":"You must now see, no-one wants you here.","266541":"I feel as crushed and obsolete as yesterday's front page.","266542":"Nothing I say has any influence on Edvard, I am his doormat.","266543":"They're at the gates!","266545":"Take cover!","266546":"Over there, in the undergrowth!","266547":"It's everywhere, there's no way through!","266549":"A tragedy! And why are we its chorus!?","266550":"We've nowhere to run!!","266551":"This way, hurry!","266552":"Our betrayers are everywhere!","266553":"Perhaps Sir John's maps were inaccurate?","266554":"What were they thinking? Sailing further in...","266555":"I shall never have had enough of this Inuit jerky!","266556":"Who's there!? ... Mind's playing tricks on me...","266557":"If it weren't for the Inuit...","266558":"The huskies seem full of gusto, at least!","266559":"The Inuit can look beyond the ice.","266560":"The arctic council are cowards...","266561":"Hurry, she's buried in the snow!","266562":"I just hope the bears stay away...","266563":"Never imagined I would fatigue of daylight.","266564":"...rope and as many axes as you can lay hands on.","266565":"If we'd gotten there just one minute later...","266566":"Wouldn't trust the artic council with my blisters...","266567":"We must prepare for everything and anything.","266568":"I only hope we find them alive...","266569":"About time we saw some chaos!","266570":"The denizens of night have returned to their crack in the wall, for now.","266571":"Don't let those Pyrphorians near my vases!","266572":"A trial? How unspeakably sordid!","266573":"Fight the Pyrphorians with love! They will beg you to stop!","266574":"I feel sorry for the Pyrphorians. What drives people to be like that?","266575":"My urchins have known for months this was coming!","266576":"Open war wasn't their style now, was it? But you know they won't be gone forever dearie!","266577":"Bring an end to this age of terror!","266578":"Two flawed men. But there was good in them, as there is in you.","266579":"Shades pour from the earth! We will be overrun!","266580":"Two tattered flowers showered with tears give life to a meadowfull.","266583":"Edvard becomes a monster inconceivably grotesque, but one we, for now must keep fed.","266584":"As this letter proves them innocent, let us hurry to Sir Archibald.","266585":"For almost the first time since he passed, eldest, my heart is lifted.","266586":"Building a shipyard is no small matter, our work is far from finsihed.","266587":"Father would be ashamed to see his brother now.","266588":"I shall not be content with any ship, until I can say it is one we ourselves have built.","266589":"The ship is another serendipity we should be grateful for.","266590":"I could hire these Pyrphorians as mercenaries—defeat that nuisance Sarmento.","266591":"Hmmn I wonder if fire could fit in with my strategy...","266592":"You unstoppered the bottle and let the menace loose!","266593":"I was worried for a while there would be no Queen to grant me my baroncy.","266594":"The Pyrphorians! Don't come for me, I'm really low class!","266595":"You must have fed off my resilient aura there, driving the P-p-pyrphorians away.","266596":"Why does everyone want a piece of the Queen now?","266597":"I'm sure I recognised something about that grandmaster.","266598":"Blow away the shadows, for all our sakes.","266599":"Ruthless when you had to be, I like that. The world is rid of a great evil.","266600":"I beg you, I don't want to live in a world of Pyrphorians. Make them go away.","266601":"Phew! That's one less threat to our survival that I have to take care of!","266603":"A shame Edvard never had a taste of real justice.","266604":"I had been looking forward to putting Edvard's head through the noose. Never mind.","266605":"Surely there is someone to punish for all of this!?","266606":"Though the burden is lifted, Edvard will keep you headlocked for life if you allow him to.","266607":"Edvard has shown his weakness as a leader. We must exploit it.","266608":"This is our chance to show Edvard who rules the waves.","266609":"Sometimes doing the wrong thing is the right thing, old pal.","266610":"Why would we need a licence to build a boat? Seems that's how it is here...","266611":"Once this shipyard is built, we can gesture rudely at Edvard, and go back to adventuring.","266612":"She says it's ''your'' shipyard? Does that mean we're going to be here forever?","266613":"All I smell on your Uncle is greed.","266614":"Don’t grovel for your Uncle. He has no power over you.","266615":"You do know Edvard has no intention of lifting that debt?","266616":"Since that day you saved my life, I have presumed I knew you. But now...","266665":"We are broke, old pal! We can’t afford a passage back to your old world, back to your family! Not unless you’ve suddenly remembered what work is.","266696":"Our father is accused of high treason. Dare you to believe it? Arrested, stripped of his knighthood. We… I am terribly shaken, and the vultures are already circling.","266715":"Will you now stand by, knowing gentle father is endungeoned? It must kill him. Please come home. We need you.","266716":"Edvard registered the debt officially?!","266717":"What? Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to abducting my workers? The Queen’s ambassador himself shall hear of this.","266719":"And if I may—excuse me—a false one. We left Edvard quite willingly.","266720":"Don’t worry, that old tyrant can’t hold us back anymore!","266721":"Now that sounds like good news.","266722":"Abduction is a severe accusation...","266723":"I see nothing criminal. A bit of interfamilial bickering is only natural, and hardly a matter for the crown.","266724":"And as for you, I have quite forgotten my manners. Sir Archibald Blake, ambassador and confidant to the Queen. Despite the circumstances, Her Majesty and I were pleased to hear of your return. Your father’s death was a tragedy; we regret he never had the chance of a fair trial.","266725":"Sadly your Uncle has indeed alerted me to some floating liabilities. I fear you have no choice but to settle them if I am to grant you your crown shipping licence.","266726":"Indeed! Once my letterpress is up and running, the truth will come back to haunt Edvard! For your hospitality, please, use my ship howsoever you may wish!","266727":"Pencil-polishing popinjay! I should have been rid of you long ago!","266728":"The real tragedy here is the vast funeral bill that goes unpaid, while this brat is living the life of O'Reilly!","266729":"Boom!","266731":"A shame you can't appreciate the craft this requires. Never mind, the charges have been primed, the perimeter cleared, we are ready to detonate.","266732":"Who are all these busybodies? Blowing up rocks can't be that complicated!","266733":"Ha ha! My apologies - that was indeed impressive! Is there anything dynamite won't solve, I wonder?","266735":"So, you found us. Take a look around. What can the henchmen of the Empire do to us that the Pyrphorians haven't already?","266736":"Please, Miss Sarmento, we come here only to prove our father innocent—Samuel Goode.","266737":"Goode? The man that sold Her Majesty's precious island to me? He is just as guilty as I am!","266738":"So you are calling me a liar? Love is blind. Back before they left their fiery mark, the Pyrphorians told me your father would come— to sell me Prosperity.","266739":"I knew conspiring against the Empire was a bad idea. Afterwards, when I refused to work with the Pyrphorians, they came to teach us a lesson.","266740":"Now our movement drills their oil for nothing, night and day. We have lost the strength to fight.","266741":"Still we are afraid. And even though we buried the dead and found a hideaway, I cannot provide shelter for all of them.","266742":"So you won't let go? Then let's get to business. Help me shelter and protect the good people that are part of this movement. If I see you can be trusted, I will find you the contract that sealed the deal on Prosperity. Are you in?","266743":"I don't know about you, but my father would never have betrayed his Queen!","266744":"We are very sorry to hear your situation. Still, I must insist on our obtaining of father's…","266745":"How long can it take to peel a potato?","266746":"Where is my sausage!?","266747":"Are you darning the things yourself?","266748":"The longer you wait, the less inclined I shall be to write off your sizeable debt.","266749":"A few bottles of bathtub booze?","266750":"Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to theft?","266751":"I will let Edvard know that I have granted you your shipping licence.","266752":"We also hear on the grapevine, of your commendable intention to establish your own shipping company…","266753":"Her Majesty warmly invites you to trade in sovereign harbours, at your own discretion of course.","266759":"I know, it's not much of a ship, but this is no time to be picky.","266760":"Your father always saw to it that we had rights and unions and all that gubbins.","266761":"Shame what happened to your father. We'll stand by your side!","266762":"We will follow you as we followed Samuel!","266763":"Ready to leave Bright Sands behind!","266764":"If you're only half your father, you're way beyond Edvard!","266765":"Your uncle is nothing like your father! We'll follow you!","266766":"I know we look like criminals, but we were trusted associates of your father.","266767":"Granting such a prestigious commission shows the council may be willing to give us fair hearing.","266768":"The last moneys I spent on Ditchwater appear well spent, eldest—and the faith I invested in you.","266769":"This could be the start of something significant for us.","266770":"I'm sure if we have iron deposits, you can find them, eldest.","266771":"If the royal fleet is to be at the cutting edge, we must start producing steel.","266772":"Steel! How proud father would be.","266773":"You have put in as much hard work as anyone else!","266774":"To outfit our ships, we're going to need to fashion all that steel into weaponry.","266775":"Perhaps we should sell ships to partners father trusted.","266776":"I predict inexhaustible demand for our steel!","266777":"We are the beating heart of industry in the Empire.","266778":"Exactly the sort of mischief I remember you by.","266779":"Mr. Ticker has years of experience in detonations, we must secure his services.","266780":"Who would kill such a gentle man? Why?","266781":"Always dangerous, getting wrapped-up in the business of a Queen.","266795":"My bond is to you, not to your monarch.","266796":"You're part of it now, just like your father was.","266797":"Once you reach the top, there's only one way from there.","266798":"I'm still waiting for the boom!","266799":"I suppose it is better to let the experts handle it.","266800":"My sword is fashioned from Ukku steel, but to produce in these quantities!","266801":"This steel will command great value.","266802":"I never imagined a city could grow so fast.","266803":"You're a real fat cat now! Hope you remember one day how you got here…","266804":"The workers may as well start preparing for the detonation.","266805":"Admit it, you’d never have hired a demolition expert in the old days.","266806":"Fizzle, fizzle, boom! Hahaha.","266807":"The way to the iron mines is clear!","266808":"Perhaps you can help me understand who keeps a murder under their hat? Forgive me, I know we speak of your father…","266809":"I read in the papers you build ships like your father. His actions have likely led to war, so it would be strangely fitting if you were to supply the Queen's fleet.","266810":"You are doing Her Majesty a great service in these difficult times.","266811":"How are those ships coming along? Her Majesty will be pleased.","266812":"Her Majesty wants only warships. It is after all important in such times that she defends her sovereignty.","266813":"We rely more and more on captains of industry to steer us to happy futures.","266814":"You're stubborn, that's for sure. A chip off the old block.","266815":"So you're the one that fled his duties. Well you're too late, there's nothing to be done.","266816":"You realise this will be no palm-tree paradise, only hard graft?","266817":"My wife tells me I shouldn't be so hard on you.","266818":"You're brave coming back, many people blame all this on you.","266819":"Samuel always had high hopes for you. It was a great blow to him when you left.","266820":"My prison outfit remains in protest.","266821":"Edvard is the major cause of my distemper, not you.","266822":"Somehow got used to these pyjama stripes.","266823":"Dead or alive, I’ll always be Samuel’s man.","266824":"I realise I should have told you sooner.","266825":"Perhaps now you have the means to take justice into your own hands.","266826":"Ah, the prodigal child. Epitome of selfishness.","266827":"It'll take a lot to convince me you're worthy of the name Goode.","266828":"You never know what you have til it's gone, eh?","266829":"Give me a reason to forgive you.","266830":"Murdered? You are joking, surely!","266835":"There was a time when I took any opportunity that came my way, just like you.","266836":"Through all the smoke, I see a glimmer in you.","266837":"Choose your customers, don't let them choose you.","266839":"Oh do stop, Archie. Is this tiny fleet all I have to sink to get my island back?","266840":"Who are you, to speak up without permission?","266841":"So Edvard is the traitor! I certainly never authorised that silly-billy to act on my behalf. I declare the contract null and void.","266842":"Then I suppose we'll not be sinking any ships today. Not even as a deterrent?","266843":"Well in that case I hereby declare Prosperity returned to the Goode children—to compensate the dead father, thereby ensuring Miss Sarmento and co. are safe from this Pyrphorian nuisance.","266844":"I don't do favours for the children of traitors. Or does that look tell me you're willing to pay…?","266845":"I'm sure it won't be too long before Edvard contrives to have him back in prison.","266846":"I don't care why Edvard sent them here. That's his business.","266847":"Your father's death was a routine suicide. We get them all the time.","266848":"Nothing in this prison escapes my notice, if there was any funny business with your father's death I'd have known about it!","266849":"Isabel Sarmento, Her Royal Highness The Queen requires you to give up your iniquitous seizure of Prosperity, an island which, by no means...","266850":"Er… this is one of the Goode children I mentioned. A little forward, but surprisingly helpful so far!","266851":"Terribly sorry, your Majesty, but I fear not.","266853":"Then we too were betrayed. We will leave Prosperity immediately, your Majesty.","266854":"They are more than a nuisance! And they will never accept this. You must be careful!","266860":"You look into this, eldest. I'm not sure I can face it.","266874":"This is what we wanted after all. To know the truth.","266875":"What could he have meant, eldest? I fear this mystery is only just begun.","266876":"I now have more questions than answers.","266877":"Father's killer was a nobody. Something greater conspires against our family.","266878":"Oh we are swept up in something now, eldest. And I am coming with you…","266879":"I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering such mysteries.","266880":"I wonder if Sir Archibald knows of this Pyrphorian threat? I think we have enough here to beg his consideration again…","266882":"Where is the contract that would be official proof of Prosperity's sale?","266883":"Be careful, eldest.","266884":"It relates the sale of the island Prosperity—the very reason father was branded a traitor.","266885":"We cannot let the truth sink into the murk!","266886":"Father’s own hand! Now we shall know his mind, eldest.","266887":"Don’t be afraid to ask Madame Kahina, she became a good friend to father.","266888":"Kahina is acquainted with the new world, she is sure to have seen this symbol before.","266889":"All we have is Isabel’s last-known hideaway, and a world of unknowns in between.","266890":"Prosperity is the cause of all this trouble. I already despise that wretched place.","266891":"I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering mysteries.","266892":"If you are going to do this, I am coming with you.","266893":"At last the expedition has found Miss Sarmento. Let us hope she makes our journey worthwhile.","266894":"Maybe nothing need be sunk at all, majesty!","266895":"Regard here, your Majesty! The Prosperity contract and our father's diary. The signatures do not match!","266896":"And now compare with a freight document by our uncle Edvard. Do you see? He forged the signature in order to impersonate father!","266898":"We hear you Isabel, but first we return to Bright Sands and confront uncle Edvard. His wicked masquerade is over!","266899":"A tiger must stay low and close to his prey.","266914":"Still your rage. The trail may not end here.","266915":"There, that must be the villain's ship!","266916":"Keep a good distance, but don't let the wretch slip away.","266917":"Your father's testament is clear! No guilty man would write with such confidence!","266918":"He has nowhere to go.","266919":"There is the ship. Let's keep our distance, see where it goes.","266920":"His words are a warning. Whoever our nemesis is, they are many steps ahead.","266921":"He is dead?","266922":"Gather your things Edvard. For your trial.","266923":"No!","266924":"Samuel will forgive you on the other side, Edvard!","266926":"After the excellent work you are doing for the fleet, I think you're entitled to pursue the odd personal matter.","266931":"I wish as much as you that your father were innocent in this.","266932":"Those very serious accusations against your father are hard to dismiss without proof to the contrary.","266933":"The sale of Prosperity, made in Samuel's name, has weakened Her Majesty's position greatly.","266934":"You digging around in state matters isn’t ideal, but in this case may be necessary.","266935":"That these ''Pyrphorians'' may have spread their influence in the New World is grave news indeed.","266936":"The situation closer to home is already difficult. Her Majesty has come under increasing scrutiny from many sides.","266937":"Her Majesty may go to war with Isabel. That is why she is mustering a fleet.","266938":"Isabel will be cagey, but I think she with time may listen to us.","266939":"Isabel may not trust you to begin with. But remember, neither did I!","266940":"You may find Isabel fiercely independent. But I trust in you to bring her round.","266941":"I fear Her Majesty will not care to know the difference between these Pyrphorians and the local rebellion. So we'll have to leave that to you.","266942":"I wish you the best, for Queen and country!","266943":"No, child. It's too late. Judgement has already come.","266944":"I am.","266945":"No please, don't be afraid. It's time to let go. My ship has sailed...","266946":"Look! Devils from below breathing fire and flame!","266947":"We are not afraid of cowards hiding behind masks.","266948":"Their fleet is formidable. I count many ships.","266949":"Yes, Grandmaster! Gladly.","266950":"Edvard Goode. Are you ready to be reunited with your brother?","266951":"Of course you are. The heat will peel your sins from your flesh like cloth. Acolytes, purge the place!","266952":"Pathetic! But then, surely Samuel awaits you too! The whole Goode family can be reunited in the everlasting. We squeezed the life from your father's lungs, peeled your uncle's skin...You must be curious as to what we plan for you!","266953":"A new world order is at stake— the Empire already shaking to its foundations, and the Goode family helpless to prevent it! We first eradicate the offspring and then eradicate the Queen!","266954":"No surprise to hear criminals are drawn here, they go where the money goes.","266957":"A lot of strange people like to meet in my harbour. That's the nature of the business.","266958":"Too many shadows to know where one starts and another begins.","266959":"Don't be stubborn like your father. Stay away from the new world, Prosperity—it is the source of all your troubles.","266960":"Your father was one of the few honest traders.","266961":"Your father was a dear friend to me. To think the killer hid himself in my harbour…","266962":"Smoke rises on the horizon. A threat emerges.","266963":"Your father was singled out. The Queen's most trusted. I know how these schemes work.","266964":"The Pyrphorians keep themselves very secret. They may be watching your every step!","266965":"The Pyrphorians are an arcane sect. Invisible, yet everywhere.","266966":"What is that tinseled marionette talking about, Archie? We are safe here, aren't we?","266971":"As safe as the situation allows, highness.","266972":"Oh you are awfully right, old chum. I beseech you, we must protect Her Majesty at any cost!","266980":"They will come for you, for everybody!","266981":"Killing your father was easy…","266982":"Want to go down with your father, do you!","266983":"The wildfire catches… it catches!","266984":"The sixth age of man approaches!","266985":"We are the firebringers!","266986":"We mortals shall take back the earth!","266987":"Look at all those subjects! How enthusiastic they seem! Do you think they celebrate me, their royal highness?","266988":"And you are absolutely sure this Samuel Goode was innocent?","266989":"Let's heal it then, and be off.","266990":"My sincerest condolences, children of Samuel. For the loss of the father you loved, and for the tragedy caused by the unfortunate actions of your uncle.","266991":"For your unquestionable loyalty and bravery you shall be knighted, and bequeathed the island of Bright Sands from now and forevermore!","266992":"Hahaha... Forgive me, I always laugh at funerals!","266993":"In a manner of speaking, your Majesty, in a manner of speaking!","266994":"No doubt, your Majesty—mustn't worry. Your attendance at this ceremony is nothing short of sublime. A gesture of the uttermost nobility that can heal this tormented place.","266995":"I fear Majesty, it is time we were on our way...","266996":"See? Her Majesty is paying her last respects, just as Archie promised!","266997":"From now on they rest side by side in the family vault.","266998":"She is...","266999":"Bright Sands is returned to us, father's name is cleared. So, that will be all, eldest. Will you and Aarhant be leaving?","267000":"I'll do anything to know the truth, even if it mean dealing with Isabel's rogues.","267005":"I will not be fooled, Aarhant. I know that we shall one day be parted. But if my prayers be answered, today will not be that day— dearest sibling? Today is not a day for parting.","267006":"Yes, just look at her. I bet she's already forgotten who we are.","267007":"They are at peace now.","267008":"...the Queen. She's the Queen.","267009":"After all we've been through?","267010":"As it stands, they are an easy target for the Pyrphorians. We should help, eldest.","267011":"You have done more to protect her people than Isabel could possibly have hoped, eldest.","267012":"From what we know of the Pyrphorians, I don't think it's enough yet to deter them.","267013":"Prosperity—I want to see the island that caused all this with my own eyes.","267014":"Then the Pyrphorians wanted Prosperity for the oil. No doubt to keep their fires burning.","267015":"I think we can ask anything of Isabel with her people sheltered, defended and now supplied.","267016":"This is about as much as she can ask for.","267017":"Isabel is showing genuine gratitude. Perhaps she isn't the sort I thought.","267018":"For the first time in my life, I know freedom.","267019":"Isabel claims to know the whereabouts of the contract, and it is the only trail we have.","267020":"I am so glad we are finally seeing the world together, eldest.","267021":"There it is— Prosperity. The source of all our troubles.","267022":"These fires cannot be due to the warm climate.","267023":"The firemen confirm it was arson! These fires were set upon us!","267024":"This monstrous fire-raising is deliberate. The Pyrphorians!","267025":"Isabel is mistaken. I won't hear these lies about father.","267026":"Why has Isabel not yet given us the Prosperity contract? She is worryingly elusive on the subject.","267027":"Isabel plays on our emotions. Still, if the sick could be carried to La Isla to convalesce…","267028":"A messenger boy has brought us a letter.","267029":"It is in Isabel's interest we find that contract! The Queen will realise Sarmento was forced into the deal.","267030":"What do you do here at the family crypt, Edvard? Do you vaunt your betrayal?","267031":"Enough! It was you who sold Prosperity for the Pyrphorians! You forged father's signature! You sentenced him to death! But now the sentence is on you, uncle!","267032":"And your guilt shall long outlive you, uncle. Look what you've done to our family.","267035":"What are you talking about, child? Only words between brothers, that's all.","267036":"From the moment I saw you, I knew it meant trouble.","267037":"I knew this would happen. I was just saying to your father, I'll never come up to him—not even having sacrificed it all.","267038":"He never understood the pain, of my life in his shadow.","267039":"I can't be scared. No more than I am already.","267040":"The Pyrphorians are pure evil. I thought I had control of this frightful arrangement, but when they murdered Samuel, I realised a day would come that they came for me too. The day they purge this decaying Empire with fire and flame.","267041":"Lo and behold, Her Majesty! Finally, I become worthy of her notice.","267042":"Yes. Guilty as charged.","267070":"Build us a haven on La Isla, and we can talk about getting you that contract.","267075":"We will help you. But first you have to help us.","267076":"The Pyrphorians would only exploit us if we tried to resettle ourselves. But with an island under your flag…","267077":"This place is more than good enough for us. We are used to living on very little.","267078":"They are mostly just civilians, hoping for somewhere they can feel safe.","267079":"This can be our fortress. A beautiful garden away from terrible things. We must protect it.","267080":"Once this is over I promise to repay you. Right now, I care about my people's safety!","267081":"We must be ready for the Pyrphorians if they come.","267082":"You could make the resistance yet! We are grateful to have such security now.","267083":"You're doing amazing work. Together we will fight them with everything we have!","267084":"Now you can focus on La Isla. Securing the future of men, women, and children!","267085":"Prosperity has been nothing but trouble for us. Go see for yourself.","267086":"My followers on that island are living in fear!","267087":"The persecuted, the diaspora, flock to La Isla. We must shelter them.","267088":"We need to be able to hold out should the Pyrphorians strike. Anything you can provide will help.","267089":"I feel bad for asking. But these people come here pockets empty.","267090":"This place, La Isla, can be a fortress of salvation to these people.","267091":"I didn't know if I could trust you. But you have given these people hope, and a future.","267092":"We must get the people what they need, before the Pyrphorians can break our supply lines.","267093":"Your father was guilty. I was with him when he signed the contract.","267094":"I wouldn't be surprised if the Pyrphorians pressured your father too.","267095":"The Pyrphorians took Prosperity from us the moment that deal was signed.","267096":"Helping you is too risky right now. My people need shelter from the Pyrphorian menace.","267097":"We had no choice. The Pyrphorians coerced us into buying Prosperity from your father.","267098":"Prosperity is so rich in natural resources. No wonder it is the source of all this conflict.","267099":"We want to forge something new, break away from the old.","267100":"I trust your Empire no more than the Pyrphorians. We are just pawns in their game.","267101":"Break free of La Corona, only to land in the lap of these Pyrphorian devils.","267102":"They will torch the whole city, if you try to meddle. I suggest setting up routine patrols!","267103":"Then the fires begin. It is their warning. You must find these masks who walk with the devil!","267104":"The scars the fire leaves behind do not heal fast.","267105":"We need a dedicated team to police the arsonists.","267106":"I don't think your sister likes me. But I have to keep fighting for what I believe in.","267107":"With your patrols, we can catch the arsonists in the act.","267108":"Catch the Pyrphorian arsonists!","267109":"It is these arsonists’ turn to be afraid!","267110":"The Pyrphorians work the weak to collapse. La Isla is their only hope of recovery.","267111":"Have sympathy for the many who are sick. Exhausted from the mines and the oil pumps.","267112":"There are many who struggle even to walk, cruelly made to work.","267113":"This is becoming a crisis. I worry the sick will die if we do not give them beds and clean linen.","267114":"Their homes were taken from them. Help them dream again.","267115":"First La Corona, now the Pyrphorians. If we come through this with our lives, we'll be lucky.","267116":"Take the sick and the weak from Prosperity to La Isla. Save them from a life of exploitation.","267117":"I cannot watch my people struggling under the Pyrphorian yoke.","267118":"We cannot rely on the old guard, they have given so much of their lives already.","267119":"This shall be the moment our movement truly begins! New ideas, new energy!","267120":"The young ones dream of something better. Better homes and a better life.","267121":"Without somewhere to call home, it is over for them.","267122":"These refugees, they have nowhere else to go.","267123":"You have to learn to make what friends you can out here.","267124":"I hate knowing the Empire or La Corona could just come here and crush us.","267125":"I'm sure your Queen wants to go charging in like a bull in a china shop. But good people still live on Prosperity.","267126":"I don't plan to leave anyone behind.","267127":"Keep the people moving. Now is not the time to stop and think.","267128":"All of us sticking together. That is the best chance we have of defending ourselves.","267129":"Even a modest fleet would give us independence.","267130":"It is not on land, but on water where we are vulnerable.","267131":"Wow this ship is so beautiful!","267132":"We shall name her after my brother, and pin a lock of his hair to the mast.","267133":"Pyrphorian ships approach. I have never dealt with them face-to-face. What can they want?","267134":"It is started—there's no going back. The Pyrphorians never give up.","267135":"Everything we produce here, the Pyrphorians take.","267136":"After the Pyrphorians come for the tithe, there is nothing left for us.","267137":"The cat is out of the bag. Now they know you are involved.","267138":"The Pyrphorian attack frightens them. Please, there must be room!","267139":"My island too must be evacuated, it is no longer safe there.","267140":"Many of my best were kidnapped. We have no hope of surviving without them.","267141":"What if these people grow sick? They're going to need a hospital!","267142":"Liar! You are the picture of regret!","267143":"You don't understand pain. Real pain.","267144":"But another tiresome prophet of doom, Archie. How dreary!","267145":"Well, momentarily, at least! Mr. Edvard Goode, you are to be placed under house arrest in Bright Sands until the time of your trial.","267147":"After the picket protests, many fine men left Bright Sands to join you.","267148":"Then Edvard struck back! He imprisoned all who were close to your father, including my beloved Thomas.","267149":"My husband and the others were deported to Wormways Prison and I've heard nothing from him ever since. If you do find him unharmed, prithee tell him his wife yearns for his return.","267150":"We're nearing the place your father died. Whatever happens, stay calm!","267151":"We didn't come here to be insulted, we came to strike a bargain. The demolitions man Thomas, we want him.","267152":"So there you are, the traitor's children!","267153":"Oh, spare me the nauseating drivel! Flogging Queenie's peachy island in the New World to some rebel upstarts?! Ha! Traitor is too generous a word!","267154":"He hung himself in one of my cells. I'd call that a rather conclusive admission of guilt.","267155":"Oh I vaguely remember him. Stubborn, with a loose mouth, just as innocent as all the others.","267156":"He is small fry, a bail has been set.","267157":"Pay every penny of his money and I will place him immediately at your disposal.","267158":"How dare you...","267159":"Father would never have! He was the Queen's stalwart, a member of the Royal Council, he...","267178":"Burn. Burn!","267183":"When a limb is severed, a new one grows.","267184":"This kingdom shall fall with the dawn's first rays!","267185":"Drones build the nest. The Queen shall come.","267186":"It takes just a spark!","267187":"We are many.","267188":"The head of the Empire must come off.","267189":"Primal fire burns eternal!","267190":"You have no influence here!","267191":"Interfere with our thralls at your peril!","267192":"You are in dangerous waters!","267193":"These penitents work for us!","267194":"We only kept them alive to do our bidding.","267195":"The thralls will serve our master.","267196":"Isabel and her allies have trangressed for the last time! Die well!","267197":"Now we must inflict what we might have saved for later.","267198":"Isabel has forgotten what we do to those who disobey.","267199":"Fire prolongs the agony of death!","267200":"I reach out to all ship's captains, adventurers, luminaries, and merchant traders the length and breadth of the Empire! Heed my call! The life of many a good sailor is on the line.","267201":"It has been three years since the Arctic Council sent its two best ships in search of the legendary north-west passage, led by my dear husband, Sir John Faithful.","267202":"We've not heard from them since. The Arctic Council are sending rescue parties north, but their fleet is too thin to cover that vast territory before the arctic winter kicks in.","267203":"Are you decent and courageous enough to join this sole woman's cause? Worry not! Your combined efforts will be generously recompensed!","267204":"You can count on that, heheh! The noble old dame belongs to one of the most prosperous families there is.","267205":"Most likely all those poor mugs indulging her husband are drowned or chewing on their own bones, but like I said, where that much lucre's rolling in, I'll never be far behind! How's about you?","267206":"I can't believe you left me to look after shop.","267211":"This is not what I was born to do.","267212":"Our bond is being seriously tested. What are all these papers?","267213":"Admit it, you've forgotten about me.","267214":"How did Hannah do this all these years? I'm beginning to feel her pain.","267215":"I've got people asking me which palette of what needs to go where!","267216":"What are you up to overseas?","267221":"I bring grave news from our ice pilots. The pack ice becomes too thick. We'd be risking our ships if we were to continue our rescue.","267222":"So with a heavy heart, I have ordered the Arctic council fleet to return southwards to our winter haven. But do not lose hope! We will gather ourselves and return next year.","267223":"Can it be, the Arctic Council retreating just as we arrive? I mean the chairman is nonetheless correct, the pack ice grows stronger every day. Still, I have no intention of giving up as they have done.","267224":"I have assembled many of the finest-known craftsmen and ship-builders at our outpost. Presently they are preparing the shipyards to house our impressive icebreakers—vessels that will help carve a way through this frozen world.","267225":"I know it is a lot to ask, but will you endure and help me to create the fleet we need?","267226":"Yeah, go on and help the old dame send even more ships to be lost in the nothingness. Looks like you finally found your captain Ahab.","267227":"Meanwhile, I will set up me own little camp nearby. Just in case you need anything, Ishmael!","267229":"When will you give up pursuing the past and look to your future as my charge?","267230":"Gallivanting off again? People will call you irresponsible!","267231":"Sir Archibald sent you, did he?","267232":"You worked so hard to defy me! Then you run away again!","267233":"Have you met with any difficulty out there?","267234":"I promise not to ask any more of you, if you were to spend more time here.","267235":"I had the strangest dream last evening. I saw my John floating above his quarterdeck. He was waving and shouting but could not make himself heard. The silence prevailed as I approached him, when a giant wolf appeared between us.","267236":"And have we gone too far also, my friend?","267237":"Then let us be swift and brave. If only I knew what awaited us upon this eternal expanse.","267238":"You know not with whom you meddle. Leave, if you value your life, else all shall burn.","267239":"You saw Amarok. He preys upon those that stray too far from the path.","267240":"I cannot say. The spirits become restless when strangers enter their realm. If we stay too long, they will never let us leave.","267241":"So you're off to the icy marrow with the old dame, brrr. Don't get lost will yer, guv? You're me best customer!","267242":"I'm no more experienced in espionage than you, eldest. But this is our one chance to uncover the truth.","267263":"All those ships transmuting into ghosts. And then... silence.","267264":"We have to make this count. That contract will reveal all.","267265":"You have it! I never knew you had the ingenuity!","267266":"It is father's signature, but in Edvard's hand! Edvard was behind this!","267267":"I believe Sir Archibald when he says Her Majesty may do something drastic.","267268":"Well done Eldest! You have served both Isabel and the Empire greatly.","267269":"If this is the only way to get to the truth, then we must follow it.","267270":"I know it's only paperwork, but the Pyrphorians cannot operate if The Empire owns Prosperity again.","267271":"Isabel was true to her word in the end. You have to admire her shrewdness.","267272":"I realise Isabel means well.","267273":"If Aarhant were here, I'm sure he'd have some good advice.","267274":"To forge father's signature! Edvard must have been possessed!","267275":"I would have been right to strike Edvard's cheek, the many times I had the inclination!","267276":"I will not rest until Edvard sees justice, even if I must escort him to the gallows myself!","267277":"As Edvard is paraded to the town square, I want to be there in the front row.","267278":"Finally all those sailors may rejoice with their loved ones. I know what you are thinking. But don't worry. I feel no bitterness.","267280":"I know the rest are alive out there, and Sir John's broad shoulders shelter them from wind and snow.","267281":"All the stories being shared about my husband give me the strength to return next summer, with an even bigger fleet. Can I count on you again then? I dare hope so, my friend! I dare hope.","267282":"Let's not beat around the bush! We found nothing but endless white, not a single soul saved.","267283":"And yet I know that my husband and his men are out there somewhere. Frozen cold, but alive! Still alive.","267284":"I will fund another rescue attempt, come back next year, better prepared, with more ships and allies with even greater determination. Will you sail beside me again then? I dare to hope, my friend. I dare to hope!","267285":"My people's future is secure. They have you to thank for this.","267353":"The contract… it is gone! The Pyrphorians must have stolen it during the attack. How did I fall for such a simple diversion!?","267354":"You are going to have to inflitrate the Pyrphorians if you want to find that contract. I'm sorry.","267355":"You beat the Pyrphorians at their own game!","267356":"If you can convince the Queen to listen, we can explain to her.","267357":"I would give you that stupid island, if only I had the contract to tear to pieces.","267358":"We cannot thank you enough for preventing this war.","267359":"With that contract, we are taking the Pyrphorians down from the inside.","267360":"Prosperity is yours, take it! We have a new home now.","267361":"Near Prosperity, the Pyrphorians would kill us on sight.","267362":"At first I thought you were a spy of the Queen. Now I know your heart is in the right place.","267363":"I can tell you where the contract is. After that it's down to you.","267364":"Stay hidden, and you will succeed.","267365":"The man I met was your Uncle? I thought he was a creep!","267366":"I am sorry you had to go through all this just to have justice.","267367":"Her Majesty will soon go to war with Isabel over Prosperity. Any other solution would be preferable.","267389":"You would be doing a great service for Queen and country.","267390":"With that document we can still reverse the original deal.","267391":"Then it was Edvard that sold Prosperity. I didn't want to believe it, but I had my suspicions.","267392":"Her Majesty is very quick on the trigger. We must some how avoid her coming to blows.","267393":"Her Majesty will soon arrive upon her charger, sword aloft.","267394":"You have averted war most delicately! Her Majesty may thank you, in time.","267395":"Good, but there's little time. Her Majesty has her campaign chart out on the table!","267396":"A whole nation is behind you, though they do not know it.","267397":"Our Empire is spread too thin to countenance another war at this time.","267398":"Now war has been averted, an alliance with Isabel might even be of mutual benefit…","267399":"With the Pyrphorian presence on Prosperity neutralised, the island can be freely returned to its rightful keeper.","267400":"The Pyrphorians will no doubt regroup elsewhere.","267401":"Isabel needn't be an enemy to us, now Prosperity is back in safe hands.","267435":"These rebels, whoever they are, will pay the penalty for challenging my sovereignty!","267449":"The time has come to take that territory back by force.","267450":"Funny, ending a war over a bit of paper!","267451":"I must admit, I am too fond of my sailors.","267452":"I understand this means the end of a rebellion on the island, very good.","267453":"So is it Isabel who is nice, or the Pyrphorians?","267454":"As long as we have Prosperity back, that business with your father can be forgotten.","267455":"So Edvard was the nasty one, and Samuel was the one with the dandruff?","267456":"Fancy forging a signature. People can be terrible, can't they?","267457":"I'm surprised that Isabel gave it back without a fight.","267458":"If you'd taken me with you, I could have helped!","267464":"I hear you ducked out of a war. Not for the first time, eh, old pal?","267465":"Now is no time for boldness, but caution.","267466":"Don't distract me, old pal. I'm getting better at accounting!","267467":"Edvard! I told you he was rotten as a fig.","267468":"Edvard is behind this? He's pathetic.","267469":"There's a space between revenge and forgiveness.","267470":"You don't know what it is you do.","267477":"That island was signed off in Samuel's name!","267478":"Do not speak to me.","267479":"Igne Natura Renovatur","267498":"In lumine tuo videbimus lumen","267499":"The earth must burn before it turns.","267500":"The wheels turn and nothing can stop them.","267501":"All must bow to the flames.","267502":"This is not over.","267503":"The fire will burn forever!","267504":"Edvard was the cause of all our grief! To see his face when he discovers we know!","267519":"We confront Edvard this instant! I have so very many words for him!","267520":"Cast iron will make it very difficult for him to sidle away!","267521":"I will indulge not one of the thousand apologies I presume he has ready.","267522":"We should do what we can to get the evidence in order. No need to engage with Edvard.","267523":"The Queen wants the trial to be an occasion. We better make sure we're ready.","267524":"The evidence at such a high-profile inquiry must be absolutely watertight.","267525":"Finally we can have our revenge on Edvard for all he has done.","267526":"Leave no stone unturned. Who knows if Edvard has kept back other nasty surprises for us.","267527":"Now we are ready for Her Majesty. All the eyes of the world will be upon us.","267528":"If the Queen wants to make a big song and dance of the trial, we better see to it.","267529":"The Queen's visit, not the trial, may be the greatest occasion of your people's lives.","267530":"I don't know what I would do without you, eldest.","267531":"Everything comes under scrutiny in the presence of royalty.","267532":"Edvard is as good as dead to me.","267533":"I will not look at him at the trial.","267534":"Concentrate on securing a verdict for Edvard!","267535":"You were out there in paradise, and I dragged you into all this. I'm sorry.","267536":"You are the one positive in all of this. No sister could have asked for more.","267537":"Is this business really nearly over, eldest? I don't feel any better for all we've dug up.","267538":"I should have seen through it. Saved father while I had the chance.","267539":"Your ill tidings come as no surprise to me. Edvard's face betrays the game is up.","267546":"I pity the man.","267547":"There will be punishment. But Edvard has suffered from the day Samuel died.","267548":"Whatever the punishment, the damage to Edvard is already done.","267549":"We must prepare for a reckoning. Edvard was never the true enemy.","267550":"It is the Pyrphorians behind all of this, we cannot neglect the threat they pose.","267551":"The trial is a distraction. The real danger we are yet to face.","267552":"It is a start. But the Pyrphorians are many.","267553":"Do everything to make sure the Queen is safe, old pal.","267554":"It will be an honour to have the Queen here, but it is not without risk.","267555":"Good, but the Queen may still be vulnerable.","267556":"Stay attuned. This is the perfect time for our enemy to recover.","267557":"We have seen nothing of the Pyrphorians but their minions.","267558":"Whoever is behind the Pyrphorians will take this time to weigh their options.","267559":"We cannot let this business with Edvard divert us from the real threat.","267560":"Black clouds loom, my old friend. Be ready to raise your umbrella.","267561":"I feel uneasy, and it's not the trial.","267562":"Even if we cannot forgive Edvard, we have to learn to let it go.","267563":"I have met the jury. They are idiots!","267564":"The Queen certainly speaks her mind.","267565":"Forget me, my race is run. A true devil is loose. It must be vanquished.","267568":"My defeat can still be your victory.","267569":"I know you want a villain, but this plot goes far beyond my petty greed.","267570":"Then you have all I can give you. I pray that it will be enough.","267571":"I'm sure you wish it was I who died. Well, soon you may have your wish.","267572":"Prosperity was only the beginning. These people will destroy everything and everyone if they have to.","267573":"There is a great danger to the established order. I will give you any help I can.","267574":"My life may be forfeit, but I can still do a last bit of good.","267575":"I didn't know what I was getting into, and then it was too late.","267576":"My father never loved me all these long years, only Samuel.","267577":"I sold our family down the river, no use hiding that now.","267578":"I regret everything. I know what Hannah must think of me.","267579":"I will not play the martyr, but I am ready to sacrifice myself for you and your sister's happiness.","267580":"I have been selfish, but I am not one of them, I never was. You must believe me.","267581":"I did not know they would kill Samuel for it, I had no idea!","267582":"Of course I will be a witness. After all you've done for us.","267597":"With Prosperity off our hands, the Pyrphorians will leave us alone.","267598":"Let me help you. I know I can make a difference.","267599":"I will tell them everything I know.","267600":"I don't need to take an oath to speak the truth.","267601":"I hope as witness, I can prove the Pyrphorians were behind this deal, not us.","267602":"I was certain it was your father that day, but now I know was wrong.","267603":"Your majesty. Isabel Sarmento, at your service.","267605":"I think it's better you break the bad news to Edvard. Let him know his gambit is over.","267619":"A terrible business. Edvard must be put now to trial.","267620":"It has been decided that you shall construct a new Court of Justice for the purpose of Edvard's trial.","267621":"As saviour in the New World, Her Majesty agrees that you should host this prestigious trial.","267622":"It is fitting that a new crown court be erected upon family soil for the trial.","267623":"Just like your court of justice, the case against Edvard is beginning to gather momentum.","267624":"Her Majesty has been ever so much looking forward to seeing her new Court of Justice. I hope you'll be ready.","267625":"Her Majesty is itching to visit! Have your best curtsey ready!","267626":"I hardly dare interrupt the miraculous transformation of your island, but Her Majesty is rather keen to get on with things.","267627":"This could be a good opportunity for Isabel Sarmento to come forward as a witness.","267628":"I think we have built up enough trust with Isabel to rely on her as a witness.","267629":"Her majesty was remarkably tolerant of the idea of Sarmento as a witness.","267630":"When it comes to the Pyrphorians, there's still a lot we don't know.","267631":"The Queen has taken a great interest in this trial.","267632":"Once built, your Court of Justice shall inaugurate a new era of peace and prosperity for Empire.","267642":"This trial should be a celebration! A toast to all things civilised.","267643":"I don't normally attend trials so this one must be important.","267644":"You now own the highest court in the land!","267645":"The Court of Justice, magnificent!","267646":"Is the Court of Justice finished yet? Not quite?","267647":"I can't wait to play judge and give the gavel a sharp tap!","267648":"Did Archie tell you I planned to visit? I hope there's a convenient mooring for my flagship. I don't like long walks.","267649":"Treat me as you would any other guest.","267650":"Just so you know, I am not fond of garlic or profiteroles.","267651":"One approves! And it is nice to get out and about.","267652":"It all sounds very cheery so far. Make it cheerier.","267653":"Mind you, I do like it when things are special. You can do special?","267654":"May I express my gratitude for your sterling work preserving peace on the continent.","267655":"So this is the funny little island that's hosting the trial! Jolly good.","267656":"Now I'm here, I am of course impatient for the trial to begin.","267657":"A modern Queen must show she is able to dispense mercy. The man must be given fair hearing.","267658":"Where are all the witnesses?","267659":"Now we are finally all present, let this long overdue trial commence!","267660":"And where's the defendant?","267661":"I lick my lips at the prospect of another Goode family tribunal.","267666":"People who disappoint the monarch often end up with me.","267667":"And the Queen is going to be there. What a treat.","267668":"Don't think you will get all the plaudits. Crime is my bag.","267669":"Your sister is very keen to see justice done. I will use all the tools at my disposal to ensure that is the case.","267670":"The problem with public inquiries is everything's out in the open.","267671":"Imagine serving twenty years in the system, and never getting a sniff of a trial like this.","267672":"Obviously you'll need my official authorisation of transfer if you want your prisoner brought to the dock!","267673":"Everything relating to the prison and its prisoners has to go through me!","267674":"You cannot allow Bright Sands to be subjugated! Our childhood home!","267695":"Bright Sands! You must save them!","267696":"Uncle Edvard… He’s suffered enough, eldest. I believe I can forgive him now.","267697":"Now we are all that remains, eldest. I intend to take strength from that.","267698":"We will not give in to terror! Never!","267699":"We must avenge Edvard—the only way we can, father.","267700":"Come what may, I am not afraid.","267701":"There is only one way left, eldest.","267702":"What you did goes far beyond us, dear blood. You have saved us all from a reign of terror.","267703":"It shall be a proper funeral. Let us reunite the two brothers, side-by-side. Once and for all, confine the past to the past.","267704":"We must bury them both together in the family tomb.","267705":"Let us talk once Samuel and Edvard have taken their rightful place side by side.","267706":"I do not feel any more sadness, eldest. The clouds have lifted—azure skies lie beyond.","267707":"Have joy in your heart as you make these final arrangements.","267708":"They will not have Bright Sands!","267709":"Another glimmer! Isabel fights beside us.","267710":"They will not stop you, eldest. Lead us forth!","267711":"Fires rage everywhere! We must unmask these arsonists before its too late!","267712":"The arsonists must be intercepted!","267713":"Now the fires are out of control, and the arsonists still loose!","267714":"Quickly, the civilians! I won't see them swept up in the fighting!","267715":"Bright Sands is no place for civilians! We must come to their rescue!","267716":"Find a way to extract them unnoticed!","267717":"Poor, poor Edvard!","267718":"Edvard was ready to make peace with himself at the end.","267719":"Father always wanted you to have Bright Sands. The past cannot hold you any more.","267720":"Edvard died far better than he lived. He is forgiven.","267721":"If father had but held Edvard—shown his affection.","267722":"When I come here, I bring only cattails—for peace and prosperity.","267723":"These stones are not cold, but warm. The sun is shining again.","267724":"The past may be buried but it is not forgotten.","267725":"There will be nothing left of the city if the arsonists remain on the prowl!","267727":"The Pyrphorians have seized Bright Sands. They enchain it to their foul cause!","267747":"The sky above Bright Sands glow with maleficence!","267748":"It is time, old pal. Our nemesis approaches!","267749":"It is time we stamped out this fire for good.","267750":"When they see how bright you burn, old pal, they will shrivel.","267751":"The first of many victories!","267752":"You have my blade. I am ready.","267753":"Old friend, it's over! The last Pyrphorians are sunk!","267754":"Before all this began, I owed you a debt. I may have paid it now, but I've made up my mind to stay, help you grow, at least a little longer.","267755":"We fight with you, no matter what.","267763":"We can help you, just give us the sign.","267764":"Exploit their supply lines! Small operations can have big rewards!","267765":"Sabotage their supply lines! They rely on them as much as we do.","267766":"There is no dent in their supply! We missed an opportunity!","267767":"Ha, you did it! Without their precious fire they are nothing!","267768":"You broke the chain! Now we are really somewhere.","267769":"I never thought I would take the Empire's side!","267770":"The Queen has promised to recognise our independence.","267771":"I like Sir Archibald, he is a funny man.","267772":"This is all rather unusual. We are safe here?","267792":"This is unexpected. You are taking care of those beastly malefactors, aren't you?","267793":"A few angry hoodlums can't overthrow an Empire, can they?","267794":"I thought they must be after fame or riches, but they want to kill me.","267795":"I wonder what has become of the royal fleet…","267796":"Tell me they are not attacking this island? The one we are on?","267797":"I surrender myself wholly to your security arrangements.","267798":"I suppose then, my safety is in your hands.","267799":"Another player has had their island seized!","267800":"When we get out of this I promise you a whole duchy. Although, no, I can't actually promise that.","267801":"We are so happy to be finally allowed to leave this island. And for your heroism of course.","267802":"Under different circumstances, you might have called it a pleasant visit!","267803":"I'm sure we can make Isabel's tiny little chunk a protectorate of some sort.","267804":"A rival might take over your island!","267805":"The Pyrphorians must fall or civilisation will!","267819":"Under no circumstances must the Queen's safety be compromised!","267820":"You have won the day!","267821":"How shall I explain to her majesty that we are under siege…","267822":"This must be the Pyrphorian mothership!","267823":"My giddy aunt, that is no normal naval craft!","267824":"Without supplies, I'm not absolutely sure we can hold out…","267825":"The Queen must be saved at all costs!","267826":"Those supplies could be crucial in gaining the upper hand over our foes.","267827":"Reinforcements are coming! Our royal supply ships must pass unscathed!","267828":"We cannot afford to lose many more ships to our foe.","267829":"Perhaps this will bring their ringleader out of the woodwork.","267830":"Such reinforcements are going to be vital.","267831":"The Queen is saved! All thanks to your remarkable travails and hardships!","267832":"The battle for Bright Sands will decide the fate of civilisation!","267833":"The ever-increasing roar from the street will need a ruler as capable and wise as Her Majesty.","267835":"First Samuel, now Edvard! Soon I will be rid of your dreary family once and for all.","267848":"Goode and Sons. Favourites of the Royal Council. How I've enjoyed watching your family's slow and ignoble demise.","267849":"What a fool Edvard was to trust us!","267850":"Behold my solar barque!","267851":"Chivalry died with the monarchy! Your family of goodie-goodies was always likely to be first on my list.","267852":"Nothing can stop the turning of the wheel, or meek mice from crushing beneath!","267853":"Goode and Sons are the thorn in my side. Without it, the Queen shall come quietly!","267854":"The Empire has no hope of survival without its vassals!","267855":"You will die along with your goodie-goodie father!","267856":"Fools! Outmanoeuvred by a merchant trader!","267857":"Feeble underlings, you have only yourselves to blame!","267858":"You are not fit to kneel before the infernal mother.","267859":"The day has come when all the world shall rue its pride!","267860":"My vengeance upon you shall be my magnum opus! Just wait.","267861":"No! This is not the end!","267862":"Confound you meddling Goodes! I will return, and take you to darker places than ever you could conceive.","267863":"Martyrs to the cause!","267870":"For each head torn another grows back!","267871":"Master, our organism is withering!","267872":"You said we could not fail, master!","267873":"What of your promises, master? What of our victory?","267874":"When one is torn away, another succeeds","267875":"Light of Prometheus!","267876":"You will be our fuel!","267877":"Even if your father was a traitor, I won't judge you before I know you.","267878":"What a wonderful display of different species, all living in harmony.","267879":"So much to be gleaned in that marvellous museum!","267880":"Oh my, what a tragedy for your island's natural habitat…","267881":"What a revolutionary way to resolve unemployment!","267882":"Nothing warms my heart like all those happy little smiles.","267883":"They must love you so much!","267884":"Not many are brave enough to show such empathy!","267885":"Your compassion for your people is admirable!","267886":"A beautiful city is a reflection of a beautiful soul!","267887":"I thought I'd have to cross the globe to see such wonders!","267888":"I can't wait to hear what stories they have to tell!","267889":"What have they brought back? Oh, it feels like Christmas morning!","267890":"Don't be discouraged, the journey is itself to be treasured.","267891":"It will turn out better next time!","267896":"Can't thank you enough for bailing my Thomas out of gaol.","267897":"Not just my husband—all from your father’s circles were clapped in irons.","267898":"Destruction can be constructive…","267900":"We'll blast the competition out of the water!","267901":"You don't know what it's like, trying to keep a lid on this jar of rats.","267902":"Samuel's suicide was his confession. Why are you trying to complicate things?","267903":"Puzzling, yes! I love a good mystery.","267904":"Off to the colonies as royal ambassador? You may end up a tray of hors d'oeuvres!","267905":"I wouldn't want to be associated with a murder.","267906":"I rarely have time for sightseeing in the colonies.","267907":"Murder? Why it's unthinkable!","267908":"I hear you're going on an expedition for the Queen, how tremendous!","267909":"Ah come on, don't be so surprised, murder happens all the time!","267910":"Even when you're off in the New World, never lose sight of what's under yer nose.","267911":"I don't like what goes on in that prison any more than you do.","267912":"A little bird tells me you're meeting Isabel? There's a woman who understands progress.","267913":"My father too courts the attention of assassins. Not so much my mother.","267914":"Preparing to go to another world? This one is already too much for me!","267915":"Murder, was it? A compelling development.","267916":"Why would you want to go to the New World, when all you could ever want is right here?","267917":"You have discovered your opponent's move. Isn't it time you made yours?","267918":"If I find out you've been meeting with rebels!","267919":"They probably did it for money—I would.","267920":"You would tell me if you discovered El Doo-dah out there, wouldn't you?","267921":"Oh gawd, what have you got yourself into now?","267922":"The New World, blimey. Sounds a long way away!","267923":"When it comes to murder, all roads lead to Rome.","267924":"So, you're the Queen's errand boy.","267928":"High walls and flowers won't conceal the gore.","267929":"The splenetic, iron-sweet whiff of the warmonger…","267932":"Please, we are slaves! Do not return us to those demons!","267933":"Is it really safe here? If I ever see another Pyrphorian it will be too soon.","267934":"I was very sick before this divine intervention!","267966":"I know we can build a future here!","267969":"Help they have found us!","267970":"There's no deep abyss holds intrigues as eldritch as this.","267972":"Exquisite zoo. And people say trophy hunting is tasteless!","267973":"Sarmento? I know the name.

With the merchant ship left to the dogs, the crew fume at such a display of weakness at their friend's time of need.","800171":"The Inspector","800172":"<b>'I do hope you've nothing to hide?'</b> smirks the Royal Inspector, as his soldiers help him aboard from the row boat. Sailors twitch. Your ship is certain to contravene her majesty's law, since it has encroached into demilitarised waters.","800173":"Quickly forge an official document","800174":"Threaten him and his soldiers","800175":"Talk him out of the inspection","800177":"<b>'Very good'</b>, grimaces the Royal Inspector, scarcely concealing his displeasure at having to let you off the hook. His remonstrations with his soldiers as he wobbles aboard the row boat are a great source of amusement for the crew in days to come.","800178":"<b>The Inspector's lip wobbles.</b> 'I beg you,' he says, 'I have a gift, if only you will spare us.' Sure enough, the gift is brought aboard as promised. But it is only once the Inspector and his soldiers are gone, that it feels safe enough to inspect the new acquisition.","800179":"<b>The Inspector's face pales</b> as he eyes the tigerish crew. He bows, and takes a half-step backward - a signal for his soldiers to disembark with him. Once gone, the crew breathe a great sigh of relief, knowing it to have been a close shave.","800180":"<b>'This is far from over!'</b> the Inspector snarls as he evacuates his men to the row boat. Sure enough, back aboard the royal clipper, he is seen making preparations to attack.","800181":"<b>There is a commotion</b> and the Inspector's soldiers are already among the crew. Being exceptionally well-drilled, they quickly force the crew to drop their weapons. 'Now,' says the Inspector, 'if you are quite finished, I'd like to continue my inspection of your vessel!'","800182":"<b>A disastrous melee ensues,</b> in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector calls three captive sailors forward. 'Hang these men,' he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.","800184":"<b>A disastrous melee ensues,</b> in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector picks out the captive specialist. 'Hang this traitor,' he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.","800185":"Set sail and try to outrun them","800186":"Sink the toad!","800187":"<b>Slippery as an eel,</b> steady navigation keeps your ship on the windward side, just out of the Inspector's clutches. After a tense pursuit he is forced to give up, to the crew's great relief.","800188":"<b>Though the ungainly clipper is outmanoeuvred,</b> the expedition is now many miles off course, and your ship's exhausted navigators must summon all their remaining stamina to get things back on track.","800189":"<b>It's upsetting that the Inspector's clipper</b> is near out of sight, when a hopeful last shot finds its mark, crashing in the main deck of your ship, and killing a luckless sailor. Despite having escaped, the crew are rattled by such ill luck.","800190":"<b>Complete confusion among the navigators</b> makes your ship a sitting duck, and the Inspector's clipper gleefully riddles it with cannonfire. Many die or are wounded, and the ship is left in shreds.","800191":"<b>The last they expect is a quick counter.</b> Surprised and windless, they're an easy mark. Your cannons flog the Inspector's clipper without reply, and before long, it is bubbling to the depths. The relieved crew scout the flotsam for spoils.","800192":"<b>Though the royal clipper has it worse,</b> it also deals significant damage to your ship in the chaotic exchange. With casualties and repairs on both sides, the ships agree to part, so that they may lick their wounds.","800193":"<b>The speed and power of the royal clipper</b> is impossible to match despite best efforts. Your ship takes significant damage, and a young sailor is killed by shrapnel. Retreat is the only option. Mercifully the Inspector chooses not to make pursuit.","800194":"<b>The superior clipper chews through your ship</b> with its dread bank of cannons - the ruthless Inspector intent on bringing traitors to their knees. 'We surrender!' the crew cry, but the plea falls on deaf ears. Once he has shredded the ship to bits, the smug Inspector turns his clipper about, and disappears into the distance.","800195":"Allow him to inspect the ship","800196":"<b>'This is obviously a military vessel,'</b> the Inspector says, 'in sovereign sea subject to the amnesty.' He toys with the gold button of his greatcoat. 'There will be severe consequences, unless... I hope you don't intend to offer me a bribe?'","800197":"<b>'Though this appears to be a trade vessel,'</b> the Inspector says, 'Combat was a consideration when these sails were fashioned - unacceptable in Her Majesty's seas. Unless…' he winks grotesquely, '...we can come to some arrangement?'","800198":"Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)","800199":"Take consequences","800200":"<b>'Load these crates aboard the clipper!</b> What are you waiting for?' he huffs to his men. When they are done, he smirks and offers the merest of bows, before sailing away with the plunder.","800201":"<b>'You will remain here until they are dismantled...'</b> trills the Inspector, '...those perverse modifications to your sails contravening sovereign law of the sea.' As the nit-picking Inspector leaves, it is clear an arduous refit is needed before your expedition will be allowed to continue.","800202":"Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)","800203":"Take consequences","800205":"<b>'I don't know what you were thinking,</b> bringing an armed ship into these peaceful waters,' he says, 'but I take great pleasure in imposing upon you. the longest possible route around.' Once the Inspector has gone, the crew look to one another in dismay.","800206":"<b>\"Rather excellent company\",</b> says the Inspector over a glass of port, \"I've been dying for something to break the tedium of the sea.\" Surprising even his own soldiers, the Inspector demands a gift be brought over from the clipper to mark the occasion. Of course, when he finally leaves, the crew collapse about in relief.","800207":"<b>'Very well,'</b> says the Inspector, after being given the first mate's 'special tour' of nothing in particular. He silently surveys the vessel for a torturous moment, before declaring 'it all seems above board.' Of course, as soon as he and his soldiers have disembarked, the crew of your ship collapse about in grievous relief.","800208":"<b>'Save your breath, windbag,'</b> says the Inspector, with an air of a man accustomed to weaselling. 'Show me the damn ship, or I shall become vexed!'","800209":"<b>'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'</b> the Inspector sneers, pointing to three unlucky sailors. 'Hang them,' he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.","800210":"<b>'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'</b> the Inspector sneers, and points at your specialist. 'Hang this traitor,' he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.","800227":"Of Unsound Mind","800228":"<b>The man spasms, eyes rolling, before finally falling unconscious.</b> His mania had come suddenly, with eight men needed to pacify, and bind him to the mast. Some say he is possessed by daemons and must be done rid of. The officers, less credulous, seek a surer explanation. The only way to silence a worsening quarrel, is to find a solution.","800229":"Enlist the aid of the hypnotist","800230":"Examine the cause of this wildness in him","800231":"Try to calm the crew, and pray the man recovers","800232":"Guard him round the clock in his cabin","800233":"Ignore the officers and get rid of him before it's too late","800234":"<b>The crew are delighted the man has returned to his normal self.</b> The hypnotist used a pendulum to induce him into deep sleep, before imparting subliminally, some choice words. Within days the fellow is happily back at work. All are buoyant that such a severe case was so artfully cured!","800235":"<b>It is a superb recovery in the circumstances.</b> The examination uncovers a bluish contusion under the hair. 'We are to act swiftly or he shall die!' says the doctor, as he bores a drill into the man's cranium. Once the blood is drained, the resultant hole is covered with a silver coin, and the head beswaddled with bandages. The man is fully recovered within a few days, and the crew greatly impressed by the actions of the doctor.","800236":"<b>The whole examination takes too long,</b> 'though a bluish contusion is found under the hair. 'I must act or he shall soon die!' gulps the doctor, but then proceeds to faff nervously through a medicine bag, until the poor man dies on the operating table. 'You did the best you could,' a colleague offers, but there is a hollowness to it.","800237":"<b>The patient grabs the doctor's head and smashes it against the table.</b> The doctor was tapping his knee to check reflex, when the devil cut loose. 'He wants putting out of his misery,' a sailor cries, once the man is wrestled to the deck again. So they cut his throat. Attention turns to the doctor, but he is a doctor no more. Injury has rendered him insensible; an eight-year-old boy trapped in the body of a man!","800238":"<b>Hellish horror ensues,</b> as the doctor insists on checking if 'ought is stuck in the throat'. As he prises open the lion's jaws, the daemon creature lurches up into his throat. So frenzied is this vampiric assault, that there is little the crew can do but to raise their pistols to the gruesomeness. When the gunsmoke clears, doctor and patient lie dead, entwined and contorted beneath a bloody dew.","800239":"<b>The crew are convinced</b> by the chaplain that god has a plan for this man. They agree to bind him to his bed while the chaplain prays for his fast recovery. After two weeks he still suffers gaps in his memory, and a paralysis of the face, but thanks are given to the lord above that he is otherwise his usual self.","800240":"<b>The sailors are partially convinced</b> there is a spiritual explanation for his deranged behaviour, but insist on chaining him to his bed. 'He must have done something terrible in the eyes of God,' they say. Despite all hope for his fast recovery, he dies not two days later, his malady forever a mystery.","800241":"<b>The faithless crew will not trust this to God,</b> but can neither agree if the possessed man should be thrown to sea, as desired by the sailors, or permitted a chance to see out his ordeal, as demanded by the officers.","800242":"Side with the officers and warn the sailors to cooperate","800243":"Convince the officers of the needs of the many","800244":"<b>The sailors would not dare mutiny,</b> of course, and return to their stations. At first they fear the bed-ridden man will commit some terrible act while they sleep. But they need not have worried, since he dies of the unexplained malady not two days later.","800245":"<b>The sailors are outraged</b> and their response is immediate. In greater numbers they overwhelm and restrain the officers, while the sickly subject of their fury is bound and thrown into the deep. Confidence in the leadership of the expedition is undermined and the possibility of further trouble seems never far away.","800246":"<b>No officer can deny the logic of the argument,</b> yet, when the man is bound and thrown overboard they cannot help but show their grief it is for no fault of his own, and that none had knowledge with which to better help him.","800247":"<b>'It's a bally disgrace! You dishonour a gentleman!'</b> say the officers, as the man is bound and thrown overboard, 'such incompetence shall be reported to the highest authority!' Not only is a man lost, but the expedition brought into disrepute.","800248":"<b>There was little for the guards to report,</b> bar occasionally 'quelling the mad dog' with liquor. After a fortnight, the poor man recovers with no recollection of anything, and while his hand is partially paralysed, he is still able to perform his usual duties.","800249":"<b>The damn guards are found with sacks over their heads.</b> They swear they did not see their attacker, but weakly-tied hands suggest collusion. Of course the patient's bed is vacant, and he seems to be missing, permanently. After that, rumours circulate, and no-one seems to have any trust in anyone else.","800250":"<b>The officers react with disgust to your decision to toss him overboard,</b> and state in no uncertain terms that the whole matter will be reported. But the sailors are quite obviously relieved that his demonic presence has been exorcised.","800254":"<b>After weeks of hot weather, supplies of drinking water have become dangerously low.</b> It therefore seems a minor miracle when a fellow ship appears on the horizon, for surely they have water to share? But as it draws near, the crew are aghast, for there is no sign of life aboard. 'It is a ghost ship, we must flee before it is too late!' they cry.","800255":"Send a diver to check it out","800256":"Heathen superstition! Board the ship!","800257":"Leave and hope to find an island with drinking water soon","800258":"<b>The diver does remarkably</b> to spot the fiends furled in sails, or waiting under barrels to ambush, should your men have boarded. Your ship draws alongside the vessel as if to pass, but then unleashes enough cannon-fire to drown it. The crew are elated, believing they have done the oceans a great service.","800259":"<b>Heavens shine upon you,</b> for whatever caused the crew to vacate this ship seems no longer a concern. Better yet, the lord has seen fit to provide the water you seek.","800260":"<b>The ship's hold contains an unholy mound</b> of corpses. 'God hath forsaken these men', says the doctor, 'but how?'","800261":"<b>The crew are so faithless,</b> that every creaking plank aboard the ghostly ship raises a whimper. So when a banshee howl erupts from below deck, every sailor runs for their life. One poor soul trips in a coil of rigging and cracks their head upon an iron capstan. The death exposes all the more the crew's foolishness.","800262":"Have the doctor investigate what happened","800263":"Leave the ship immediately","800264":"<b>'We are lucky indeed,</b> for malaria cannot reach us now.' says the doctor confidently. This swift diagnosis confirms the crew are pleased to load up the drinking water they have been gasping for.","800265":"<b>'Touch nothing! Get off the ship,'</b> frets the doctor, who believes a dreadful plague has taken the crew of this ill-fated vessel. Perhaps drinking water is itself the cause. The crew are miserable time has been wasted, and that their thirst is still not slaked.","800266":"<b>The doctor is inconsolable,</b> 'it is plague. I lanced a bubo, and it ruptured suddenly upon my person!' That the water be contaminated is misery enough, but to have to abandon the good doctor is a disaster! Your expedition drifts glumly on.","800267":"<b>No relief at escaping the grotesque mound of corpses,</b> can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'","800268":"<b>No relief at escaping the disturbingly empty ship,</b> can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'","800269":"<b>Terrifyingly, the ship takes after yours in pursuit.</b> Who knows what dread hands operate its multifarious controls!","800270":"Try to outrun the awful vessel!","800271":"Turn and face it, whatever it is!","800272":"<b>Your ship manages to escape</b> the ghoulish clutches of that unwholesome adversary, but have no drinking water, or anything else, to show for the ordeal.","800273":"<b>Your ship is not agile enough.</b> Men pour into the waves from where enemy cannons punch holes. Seemingly contented with this sacrifice, the dread sentience commanding the vessel calls off its dreadful pursuit.","800274":"<b>Pirates! But trickery cannot match the power of a modern seaship!</b> Summarily demolished, a few of them are left clinging to wreckage. They beg to join your cause - unpaid. Such are the dwindling prospects of piracy in this day! The crew will jibe at them, but secretly all must be elated to have acquired such sea-wisdom for free.","800275":"<b>A pirate nuisance!</b> Though their scurvy deception gives them advantage, they are like many of their creed, rather jaded. By the time their ship is sunk, it has cost you a few good men. Yet the recovery of precious drinking water in among the flotsam, assuages the grief of your crew.","800276":"<b>Bloody pirates! A terrible menace even in this day and age!</b> Your crew are outmanoeuvred, outsmarted, and your ship is reeled-in for boarding. Many are killed in valiant defence of the company, but to no avail. Your vessel is duly ransacked for supplies, before the villains are again on their way.","800277":"The Ghost Ship","800279":"The Predator","800280":"<b>'A fearsome predator stalks us!'</b> the cabin-boy whispers. Perhaps he is right, for this resupply has not been as uneventful as hoped. Only the first evening moored in this bay, and a man goes missing - tracks up the beach into jungle. Many wonder how work can be expected to continue...","800281":"Bait the creature","800282":"Send hunters to track it","800283":"Speak with locals","800284":"Lay a trap","800285":"Leave the island","800286":"<b>With the perfect lure</b> placed enticingly in the crook of a tree, there is an inevitability about a capture. Sure enough, yellow eyes pierce the darkness, and a mighty beast pads softly over to the bait. A net is hurriedly cast about it and secured, thus leaving the expedition free to resupply unthreatened.","800287":"<b>Your huntmasters are expert,</b> and trace with great care, the soft hollows imprinted by feline paw. Led to a clearing, they correctly judge this to be a lair, where they stand ready with a net. When the cat returns, heaving hot breath, the hunters pounce. With net secure, the expedition is free to resupply unthreatened.","800288":"<b>At least one hunter did the right thing,</b> and kept his eyes open while they traced the beast's pawprints. Another was not so wise, and was heard to let out a scream. His comrades were drawn to the spot, and struck the majestic beast down. But not before the damage was done.","800289":"<b>Three days pass, and still no word.</b> There is a common feeling something must be done to save those men.","800290":"Send a rescue party","800291":"Wait a bit longer","800292":"Leave the island without them","800293":"<b>It is only something of a relief</b> when the rescue party return. It's bad news... the hunters are dead. The rescue party described the bright and long-maned beast, and how in a tussle, they slayed it. With the bodies of the hunters buried, the expedition is able to resupply in an atmosphere of respectful silence.","800294":"<b>'Horror! It's picking us off one by one!'</b> bawls a fearful sailor, for now the rescue party too, have failed to return. There is nothing for the disconsolate remainder of the crew to do, but leave this sorry place behind.","800295":"<b>Doubtful prayer brings no news</b> of the lost hunters. The men have nowhere to look for guidance, and there is a burdensome feeling that a decision must be made.","800296":"<b>Conviction in the lord is of little use here,</b> it seems. Two days later a hunter, whose leg is mangled, limps back into view. After the necessary amputation, he is heard to groan that the others perished. All must leave this savage place.","800297":"<b>'We leave them for dead,</b> when they could be right there now waiting for us!' cries a furious old tar. Like so many others, he is disgusted that good men should give their lives for nothing but impatience!","800298":"<b>'Absurd magic, but it works!'</b> say officers sent to the inland village for help. Having described the beast, they were referred to a witch. She encouraged them to ingest live scorpions, one of each colour; yellow, red and black. This they did reluctantly, but found when they confronted the animal, it took flight. All promptly follow the witch's advice, and sure enough, remain undisturbed for the remainder of the resupply.","800299":"<b>'Our plight means nothing to the locals,'</b> bemoan the officers sent as diplomats. 'Telling them beasts stalk the jungle, is as like alerting a hatter to the presence of hats on his hatstands.'","800300":"<b>'Their deity is desecrated!'</b> urges the officer sent as diplomat. All around the bay, daubed faces appear, bows raised to the expedition camp.","800301":"Teach them a lesson","800302":"Run for the ship!","800303":"<b>'A hollow victory',</b> say the men. For the locals lie dead, but the jungle beast stalks on.","800304":"<b>Odds against them, the men fight as best they can.</b> Fought back onto the sand, they deflect the rain of arrows with whatever they can lay hands on. A relay is able to return precious equipment to the ship and set sail, but not without a number of casualties, of whom some do not make it.","800305":"<b>The onslaught is deadly.</b> Few among your crew have the requisite experience to defend themselves, and so the sand reddens with their blood. Of those who make it as far as the expedition ship, a number succumb to the poison-tip arrows. It is a massacre.","800306":"<b>'Run!' comes the panicked cry.</b> The men drop their work, and tramp desperately through the shallows to the ship. A volley of arrows pierces three, squirting crimson into the clear blue. 'Dead aside, we have lost a great deal more in provisions than we have gained,' laments the quartermaster, as your ship departs that wretched bay.","800307":"<b>The ingenious powers</b> of the craftsmen among your crew have fashioned a pitfall for the beast. There is not long to wait before there is a tinkle on the handbell, and all can gather above the trap to see the monster growling at its bottom. The resupply may now happily proceed, knowing that danger is averted.","800308":"<b>The beast is too intelligent</b> to fall for makeshift traps. It is clearly evading the pitfall prepared by those supposed to be the expedition's deftest craftsmen. 'Little more we can do,' they shrug.","800309":"<b>'It's a considerable setback,'</b> say senior officers. Fresh water, wood for burning, plants for medicine - it does no good to list what myriad opportunities are missed in bypassing the bay. And all for the sake of fears over one measly wild animal.","800312":"An Opera in the Jungle","800313":"<b>'It's too narrow and shallow this far upriver!'</b> warns the steersman. Escorting Mr. Cardinale to the site of his rainforest opera house now seems all the more preposterous! The great patron of the arts twizzles his moustache in frustration! Apart from braving the difficulty ahead, only traversing a nearby hill might reconnect the expedition with the upper river.","800314":"Use your gunboat to navigate the shallows","800315":"Have the ship transported over the hill to rejoin the river further up","800316":"Attempt to carefully navigate the narrow passage","800317":"Decline to proceed any further and return to sea","800318":"<b>The design of the gunboat is vital to your success.</b> Being of moderate size, and yet possessing the manoeuvring capabilities of a much smaller ship, the gunboat is able to navigate the awkward river shallows with ease. Mr. Cardinale is delighted that you have delivered him to the site of his proposed Opera House, and promises to talk favourably of each and every man when he returns to civilisation.","800319":"<b>'What a champion performance!' squeals Mr. Cardinale,</b> from the comfort of his cushioned chair. The great ship seems to swim up and over the hill. The long timbers on which it rolls, and corkscrew winches at intervals up the slope work perfectly. 'I shall put in a good word for you all at the club,' promises Cardinale, as the ship splashes down safely on the other side. The men are immensely proud of the miracle they have performed.","800320":"<b>Getting a ship over a hill is mad, but it works.</b> 'Is this absolutely necessary?' muses Mr. Cardinale, having watched the crew slip for a week in mud. But the rolling timbers and makeshift winches they have crafted prove adequate, and the ship finally scrapes down the other side, into the upper river. Mr. Cardinale barely offers a word of thanks, perturbed perhaps, by the indignity of it all.","800321":"<b>There simply aren't enough materials</b> to conduct such an elaborate enterprise. The crew think with a few extra bits and bobs, dragging the ship up the hill might be possible.","800322":"<b>'I think it's going to give way!' cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale.</b> The feet of your men slip and slide on the mudstrewn slope, as the great weight of the ship plummets it back down the hill. Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. A hideous accident caused by inadequate materials, that signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800323":"Proceed uphill without materials, belief will guide us through","800324":"Ask the locals gathered around the scene if they are able to help","800325":"<b>The men have the conviction</b> to safely hoist the ship up and over the hill. It is a fatiguing week, but belief in making the impossible possible possesses them. When the ship finally splashes into the water, Mr. Cardinale has barely a Christian word of thanks for the crew. It has taken a long enough after all.","800326":"<b>It is all going so well,</b> this mad idea, with winches and cables scarcely sufficient for the task. But exertion eventually tells. As the ship rocks over the crest of the hill, there is not enough to keep it there, and it hurtles wildly down the other side. It is lucky the ship is not swept away in the river current. Still, it sustains significant damage from impact with the trees.","800327":"<b>'I think it's going to give way!'</b> cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale. The feet of your men slip and slide on the slope, as the unholy weight of the ship overcomes the winches, and it plummets back down the hill. Men try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800328":"<b>The locals are willing to provide help and materials.</b> While it takes the crew time to incorporate the materials into their winch design, the locals are happy to wait. Good relations make the feat of hoisting a ship over a hill less painful than it might have been. The boat finally clatters down into the water of the upper river. All are most grateful to the locals, without whom none of this would have been possible.","800329":"<b>A few locals vaguely offer to help,</b> but their lukewarm efforts do little to relieve the exhausted crew. The ridiculous hill-climb takes more than a week. When the ship finally slips into the water over the other side, not even Mr. Cardinale has energy enough to care.","800330":"<b>The locals have absolutely no interest in helping you,</b> and fade into the trees. Beleaguered by shouts from Mr. Cardinale, the men meekly follow orders. The mad persistence has disastrous consequences. The ship plummets back down the hill! Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800331":"<b>Competent navigation</b> rescues your ship from the mother of all rivers. Mr. Cardinale is tremulous throughout, believing his dreams may beach like a river dolphin at any time. But over the course of three tricky days, information is relayed quickly enough between wheel and forecastle to avoid any harmful collisions. There is relief all around when the corner is made and the river broadens again.","800332":"<b>'Rapids?!' exhales Mr. Cardinale crossly.</b> Ahead white water churns. There is nothing for it but to push on. As the ship strains against the current, there are dreadful noises from rocks on the keel. The crew wince at each and every thump and screech. Finally, after a week, the river broadens again, and the crew can inspect the damage - it doesn't look good.","800333":"<b>It is a heart-breaking experience.</b> Days go by in the effort to lever the ship out of the sandy shallows, where it does not belong. It is battered by rocks and rapids, and leaks like a rusted bucket. Mr. Cardinale kicks up and awful fuss. Finally when it feels like progress is being made, the next bend reveals a harrowing sight - an insurmountable waterfall! Never have the crew felt more hopeless.","800334":"<b>Mr. Cardinale is incensed</b> that his grand plans for the rainforest Opera House have been thwarted. Some of the men find his blustering funny, but the officers are horrified that such an influential figure has been rebuffed, and are afraid to show their faces in society ever again.","800336":"The Minefield","800337":"<b>At the cry of 'mines!', all rush to the prow.</b> Sure enough, several of the conical terrors bob seductively below. 'Who knows how many of these infernal machines have passed us by, or yet await us. A false move, and this sea shall be a lake of fire! What the devil do we do?'","800338":"Use dynamite to start a chain reaction","800339":"<b>'The way ahead is clear as the eye can see!'</b> says the delighted officer, folding up his telescope. As the last motes of fire trail down into the waves and fizzle, the crew can but admire such brave use of dynamite. 'Better than fireworks!' says another, 'The men have never been so entertained!'","800340":"Try to navigate the minefield","800341":"<b>'We are masters of the sea!'</b> sing the triumphant crew, as the ship weaves easily beyond the last line of mines. 'Even Odysseus, when faced with Scylla and Charybdis, lost men. We have lost none of our company, and our bonds only strengthen!' Soon, a special bottle is being uncorked, and toasts raised to the continued success of the expedition!","800342":"<b>'What was that noise?' gulps the helmsman,</b> but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess.","800343":"<b>While at first plain sailing, the minefield is now gooey with danger.</b> A line of densely-packed mines stand between the ship and freedom. \"With a makeshift device, we might be able to clear the path ahead,\" explains the officer, \"either that, or we just try our best to weave through it.\"","800344":"<b>The awfulness has barely begun.</b> Restless waves conceal a thickening of the mines, and the ship's haphazard path makes impact inevitable. 'Brace!' scream port-side, just prior to a portion of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who have lost many good sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.","800348":"Build a device","800349":"<b>'She survived! It worked!' calls the lookout,</b> as makeshift grapples trailing behind the little dinghy are able to hook the mines aside. Relief only comes, of course, once the expedition ship is clear of this last line of mines. 'How did we get in such a pickle?' says one. 'At least we're out of it,' says another.","800350":"<b>A nervous sailor rows towards the line of mines.</b> The makeshift grappling hooks trailing behind his dinghy are intended to drag mines out of the path of the expedition ship. Unfortunately the sailor is a sacrificial goat. A grapple shatters the horns of a nearby mine, and the boat and its sailor explode in plume. Safe passage means nothing to those from whom a good friend was taken.","800351":"<b>The idea is a terrible one from the start.</b> The lengthy poles, comprised of other poles, are unwieldy and inaccurate, even in the hands of a several strong men. The crew's attempt to poke mines away when they draw near is suicide. Two booms come in succession, and a few feeble cheers at escape are drowned by the deafening wails. Few are left to bail water, when so many lie dead or injured.","800352":"Go through diplomatic papers in search of any clues","800353":"<b>The search is a fruitful one.</b> The well-organised diplomatic library includes a comprehensive folio of papers on nearby mine positions. This enables the navigators to chart a safe course through the waters. The very same paper remarks that the mines were moored during the war, in order to protect a now-disused outpost. You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.","800354":"<b>The search is worthwhile.</b> After a few hours scouring the diplomatic archives, a paper on nearby mine positions is found. This gives the navigators the difficult task of charting a safe course through the waters. No-one is quite sure if the information given is up-to-the-minute, but when the last line of mines is cleared, all are suitably relieved.","800355":"<b>The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.</b> A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.","800356":"<b>Optimism makes way for abject terror,</b> as the map of mines that is found and used for navigation turns out to be completely false. Terrible detonations devastate the ship's timbers, and countless lives are lost. 'Misinformation is worse than no information,' an officer laments, as his tears bleed the ink of the erroneous chart, which as it happens, refers to a different stretch of water.","800357":"Turn around and try to escape","800358":"<b>A few saintly volunteers approach,</b> offering to scout back the way you came and ease your escape. Asked if they aren't afraid of the cone-shaped mines, they reply 'The lord will see us through.'","800359":"Allow them to go ahead","800360":"Tell them to stay on the ship","800361":"<b>The volunteers exude calm,</b> as their lone dinghy traces a path much akin to that which got you into this mess. Although their silent vigil transports you to safety, all agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.","800362":"<b>While the path the volunteers cut is a true one,</b> it does not account for the difference in size between the two ships. It only takes a narrow graze to explode one of the mines, and though no lives are lost, the damage to your ship is significant. The crew are dismayed by the situation.","800363":"<b>For the godless dinghy, doom seems inevitable</b> the moment it drops and a man slops overboard. This inauspicious beginning foreshadows the disaster to follow. Prayers unheard, steering in the rough current proves impossible. The little boat is last seen careening towards the sinister cones it sought to avoid. 'The terrible loss of life shall remain with me all my days,' says a devastated officer.","800364":"<b>It is horrifying that most significant members of the crew</b> are aboard this fragile dinghy. Of course one would not wish a mine to explode any loyal man, but when it bellows up below a collection of your finest, death stings all the more. The crew are understandably devastated at the destruction they have witnessed first-hand. Life feels as if it may never be the same again.","800365":"<b>Your faith goes untried</b> in the nervous silence, as the ship escapes the mine trap the same way it entered. All agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.","800366":"<b>Your faith does not go untried.</b> The sinister cones have moved about over time, and no matter how truly the ship follows its original course, it is inevitable a mine will burst into the hull. Luckily when the blast comes, no man dies. Still, the burdensome schedule of repair disheartens the crew.","800367":"<b>None of it is of any use.</b> Your godforsaken crew do not realise how the sinister cones move about over time. No matter how true the course, more than one mine shakes the ship's belly as it limps clear. Many lives are lost, and the damage to the ship is severe.","800391":"Reward Event","800392":"You found some mysterious item","800396":"You found a tourist that offers to trade with you.","800441":"You have found a radiant relic! The crew toast the success of your archaeological expedition. May we now better understand what it is to be human!","800448":"You have captured a wild animal! The crew toast the success of your zoological expedition. This can only aid studies of the natural world!","800454":"You have earned a reward for your altruism! The crew toast a successful rescue, with all returning to the glad comforts of home.","800460":"You have discovered pirate bounty! With the dread buccaneers blown out of the water, a search of their sunken wreck unearths a well-deserved reward!","800467":"Love Island","800468":"<b>A matter of the heart.</b> The crew have been enjoying some island hospitality, but many are now refusing to leave. They have fallen in love with the sons and daughters of the local king. Perhaps he can be convinced to allow them to come with you? You can attempt to come to an arrangement, or else wait for him to consult his copper oracle.","800470":"Offer a wedding gift","800471":"Convince the king your crew's affection is genuine","800472":"Await the verdict of the copper oracle","800473":"Leave without the crew who've fallen in love","800474":"<b>The king is not only surprised,</b> but moved to tears by the romantic composers he hears via the gramophone. He insists on a grand banquet to celebrate the union of his children and your crew. Both traditional music and a few cranks of the new-fangled gramophone accompany the beautiful ceremony, and then its bon voyage!","800475":"<b>The king is delighted to see his children wed.</b> Delicate understanding of local custom and a smattering of their language allow a message of true love to be conveyed. The king evidently thinks his children in good hands. Feasting, and to the amusement of all, terrible dancing, follows. For his departing children, it shall be the longest, most fascinating honeymoon.","800476":"<b>Something is lost in translation.</b> Yet the king smiles benignly, as if your crew still have a chance to prove themselves. 'He suggests a great hunt,' says your diplomat, 'or else we may await arcane judgment.' His eyes flick to a copper oracle on a dais.","800477":"<b>The awkward gestures and diagrams in the sand</b> prove highly offensive to the king and his people. Sensing outrage, the crew back away towards the ship. The angry locals fire arrows at their former amours. Fittingly, one is struck in the heart, and bleeds out into the brine. The rest return lovelorn, to their dreary maps and compasses.","800478":"Capture the king a prize animal","800479":"Face the verdict of the copper oracle","800480":"<b>The hunt goes quite well.</b> Beautiful boars inhabit the woods, and though tricky to catch, are little trouble for your experts. Though the king will still not allow you to leave with his children, the feast of boar brings everyone together in the moment. The lovers understand this moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.","800481":"<b>The hunt is not perfect.</b> The crew show courage in pursuit of a tiger, which draws the king's admiration. Sadly, they cannot catch it, which leaves the king wondering if your men will be able to provide once married. Thus, he decides not to let his children leave. Some of your crew remain committed to staying behind, and it is with regret you must continue without them.","800482":"<b>Your naive hunters fail the test.</b> Forest deer are everywhere, and hunting them hardly seems a challenge. Had your so-named 'hunters' any respect for nature, they'd have realised the sacred deer were not what the king was after. Instead they gather them up greedily. The king makes it perfectly clear your expedition must move on. With heavy hearts, the sailors return to the ship.","800483":"<b>The oracle predicts a reassuring fate for all.</b> Those who wish to remain for love will live fulfilling lives, but the same shall be true for those still committed to your expedition. All parties feel a sense of peace. Your voyage shall continue without any resentment towards those it leaves behind.","800484":"<b>The copper oracle is disappointingly undecided.</b> The king cannot, in good faith, allow his children to leave to an uncertain destiny. His ultimatum is that your crew become part of his extensive family or else they must leave alone. Though understandable, it is nevertheless regrettable when some decide to stay behind.","800485":"<b>The copper oracle predicts that your souls cannot be saved.</b> With your crew rotten to the core, the king makes it clear there can be no union with his children, and that you are no longer welcome. Heart-broken and bearing the burden of sin, the crew return to the triviality of duty.","800486":"<b>The copper oracle sees only purity in your crew's hearts.</b> It predicts a bounteous future for the king's children, and so with tearful pride, he gives the couples his blessing. The traditional ceremony is both spiritually uplifting and wholesome.","800487":"<b>The copper oracle reveals a little doubt in your crew's hearts.</b> The king interprets that his children will only be happy if they remain on the island., and that some of your sailors are not in love, but merely infatuated. Still, you must lose the fine crew who have formed genuine bonds.","800488":"<b>The copper oracle reveals great doubt in your crew's hearts.</b> The king does not for a minute believe that your inconstant crew are as deep in love as they claim. If they cannot demonstrate otherwise, it might be better if your people left.","800489":"<b>The copper oracle proclaims your crew's hearts sinful and wicked.</b> Arm-in-arm with their new-found amours, the sailors await some happy answer. But the moment the king's arm is raised, daggers unsheathe, plunging into the hearts of the would-be lovers. Speechless and unharmed, the rest are free to leave the island, pondering the grave cost of faithlessness.","800490":"Try to convince the king your crew are worthy","800491":"Order the crew to leave at once","800492":"<b>Careful diplomacy has him thinking twice.</b> Perhaps there is a way for the crew to prove themselves. A lean champion steps forward. Fighting him may impress the king, or else you can try and outhunt him.","800493":"<b>The king is offended by your insolence.</b> Without a word he boards a boat and heads out to sea. Some foolishly follow, believing he can be reasoned with, but they have even less knowledge of local boats than local customs. Their bodies will be dredged from the reef as your tactless expedition struggles on.","800494":"Propose a contest of champions","800495":"Propose a hunting competition","800496":"<b>You have your champions.</b> One-by-one the suitors fight the king's champion. Those who prevail, it turns out, are permitted to take their lovers to sea. Some fail, but can at least drown their sorrows during the farewell celebration that follows.","800497":"<b>It is not a pleasant sight for the faint of heart.</b> Your best champion is put forward, and subsequently knocked about the head for the entirety of the contest. At the end a cloth is needed to conceal the disfigured face. The king expresses his condolences for your loss, but all is fair in love and war.","800498":"<b>It is close but the king's champion is outfoxed.</b> By sundown your best hunter has claimed six boars to their five. The king will still not allow you to leave with his children, but the feast of boar brings everyone together in one moment. The lovers understand a moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.","800499":"<b>Lacking the skill, your hunters try to cheat.</b> Without knowledge of the island's fauna, they decide to follow the king's hunters in the hope of poaching the animal they are tracking. But they are led a merry dance. Three days pass, and your champion is missing presumed dead. The crew have no choice but to depart, tail between their legs.","800500":"<b>Paradise lost!</b> The expedition may be back underway, but the mood is abject as the beautiful island becomes but painful memory. Too painful for one, who is discovered dead, it is said, by way of a broken heart.","800501":"<b>It is a significant blow.</b> Any happiness the crew might feel at their comrades finding love is consumed by feelings of resentment. How could they have been so selfish? The expedition goes on, but those who are still a part must take on twice as much work.","800503":"The Singular Case of the Midshipman","800504":"<b>The Midshipman is found with his throat slit, knife in hand.</b> It would appear to be suicide, but appearances often prove deceptive. Understandably, the whole crew crowd the scene, debating whether he was the type to take his own life, or if someone might have gained by his passing. Needless to say, they expect some action be taken...","800506":"The Expert will have the answers","800507":"Commence an investigation","800508":"Do nothing, it's suicide - nothing more to be said","800509":"<b>There are gasps of macabre delight,</b> as the famous detective reveals the only possible solution. 'Elementary you see. Look at this tiny moth wing on the body. Moths are drawn to light, and the sole light this night past issued from... this man's LANTERN!!' The detective lunges across the deck and secures the watchman, who being as impressed with the deduction as everyone else, readily admits to having sought to gain rank by the murder.","800510":"<b>Careful analysis of the scene</b> reveals two leads. Some believe an autopsy would leave the facts of the case plain, while others reckon the little time available should be spent analysing any evidence at the scene that might establish whodunnit.","800511":"<b>This lot aren't bloodhounds that's for sure,</b> and turn up nothing even with a strong whiff of murder about it all. With the incompetent investigation ending conspicuously silent, the crew must last the remainder of the expedition in fear they are marked next on the list.","800512":"Conduct an autopsy of the body","800513":"Fashion a tool for gathering forensic evidence","800514":"<b>The autopsy is conducted very capably,</b> and confirms the midshipman took his own life. A severe tumour is also discovered on the midshipman's brain. A letter, found later, serves to explain that the fellow knew he hadn't long to live, and wished to face death in his own way. The crew are galvanised on hearing this story of bravery.","800515":"<b>The autopsy is sufficient to confirm it was murder.</b> Strangulation was the cause of death, not a slit throat - which was added post-mortem. All else remains unknown. Nevertheless, with the cause of death established, the list of suspects is narrowed down to just a few who had the means and the motive for the crime.","800516":"<b>The autopsy is dreadfully clumsy,</b> and leaves the body almost unrecognisable. The unschooled 'medic' evidently have a point to prove, and insist on defiling it further, despite being a bundle of nerves. By the end the morgue looks like a butchery, and the stricken mortician runs wildly about the ship, scalpel in hand. Several are injured trying to restrain him, but the psychological trauma of an unsolved mystery is twice as damaging.","800517":"Interrogate until someone confesses","800518":"Beat out a confession","800519":"<b>You out the grim truth.</b> The alibi of one sailor does not match his fellows, and he cracks, confessing to the midshipman's murder. It transpires the midshipman had bragged of bedding the other man's wife. The murderer expresses only remorse for his crime, and as the noose is placed around his neck, the crew regret that justice must be so severe.","800520":"<b>The interrogation is painfully haphazard.</b> Though it is clear one of the suspects must be the killer, lines of inquiry fail to produce answers. No option remains but to offload all the suspects at the next port to prevent further incident. It is a source of great shame to the crew that fine innocent sailors are certain to be among them.","800521":"<b>A brutal approach, but one delivering quick results.</b> It seems the midshipman was preparing to whistle-blow unauthorised smuggling below deck, and was killed for it. The ringleaders threatened others with a similar fate if they didn't keep quiet. The culprits are unceremoniously shot, and the vulgar matter is over.","800522":"<b>Torture seldom results in happiness.</b> Your victim screams a confession, perhaps in the hope it will end the pain. With nothing else to go on, you scapegoat the poor beggar, and he is keelhauled until dead. The crew are in no doubt that this was the wrong man, and hope to escape your inhuman expedition at the first opportunity.","800523":"<b>What innovation!</b> A bright young spark applies some of the latest forensic researches. The knife used to cut the midshipman's neck is placed inside an airtight box along with vapours belonging to the doctor. As if by magic, when removed, clear sets of fingerprints appear on the shaft! When the crew prints are taken, the guilty party is collared in the most satisfying modern fashion!","800524":"<b>It's complicated</b> identifying footwear and gait. Ambitious of the crew, then, to attempt to solve both problems with the one device. Still the notched stick-wheel does prove footprints at the scene are suspicious, and that suspects are limited to just a few matches. But how to get to the bottom of this?","800525":"<b>Fragile justice!</b> As your craftsmen stare at an empty drawing board, gormless sailors think they help by tidying up the crime scene. With the investigation fumbled, the killer feels he has to take two more lives before he is finally caught. 'Can't believe how sloppy you are in the art of policing,' he teases, 'I could have killed ten more before you'd found me.' Caught he may be, but the damage is already done.","800526":"Let there be a trial","800527":"Put the fear of god into the suspects","800528":"Dump all the suspects at the next port, and be done with it","800529":"<b>The trial goes as well as can be expected.</b> The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.","800530":"<b>The trial is a farce.</b> Sailors bark questions from the sidelines which the suspects are quite within their rights to leave unanswered. But this obstinacy serves only to rile the shouting mob! They flood through the makeshift courtroom and carry the suspects kicking and screaming to deck, before tossing them over the side.","800532":"<b>It's almost like divine intervention.</b> The priest hears each suspect alone, and once the god-fearing killer breaks down and confesses, he is handed his rope. Still, a lack of forgiveness does not trouble the crew, who are relieved this ungodly chapter is now closed.","800533":"<b>These are not god-fearing sailors,</b> and hear the priest's weak plea for the killer to come forward with impassive expressions. Perhaps there is a different approach.","800534":"The Singular Case of the Midshipman","800537":"The Visitation","800538":"<b>An undesirable visitor haunts the ship.</b> Fleeting silhouettes, knocking and screeching sounds. Each morning the ship appears in utter disarray. 'A night fiend,' gulps the hardiest of old crewmen, as he sweeps debris from the deck. As night draws in again, you realise something must be done.","800539":"Listen to your expert","800540":"Perform an exorcism","800541":"Find the culprit","800542":"Ignore the menace","800543":"<b>Every right to a little joke.</b> 'These claw marks!' the naturalist feigns horror. 'Is it something terrible?!' asks a fearful sailor. But the naturalist can bite tongue no longer, and succumbs to laughter; 'No! Good heavens. We have a mother and kittens aboard!' The cat family is found in a barrel, which, it is agreed, shall serve as their home for the duration. The crew dote on the little rascals, their presence a great comfort.","800544":"<b>Each sailor strides with inner conviction,</b> as they form a procession of candles behind the smug-looking priest, flooding holy light into every heathen crevice. The priest's ritual is unfaltering, and not only are the crew rid of the night-time menace, but now believe it is god's plan the expedition will succeed.","800545":"<b>The crew has its sceptics,</b> even though the exorcism seems at first to have worked. Two days later a sailor cries, 'It had glowing yellow eyes!' upon having sighted the demon near the hold. The unholy thing must be caught.","800546":"Bait the thing with food","800547":"<b>It is nothing so savage.</b> All are concealed around the strip of meat, expecting the worst. But what descends from the rafters of the hold, silent and gentle winged, is a luminous white owl. It is an ambiguous omen, according to those that know, but the sailors are content to keep it aboard.","800548":"<b>Whatever it is, it is far too clever.</b> It avoids the bait, but continues its night raids. Rumour this is an offended Klabautermann are substantiated by several separate accounts. Little voices overheard, brief sightings, even the discovery of a miniature table and chair. Some can live with the impish nuisance, but many will jump ship at the next port..","800549":"Build a trap to catch the thing","800550":"<b>The cage-trap is well-made,</b> and daybreak reveals an unlikely specimen encaged. 'A sort of badger?' is the first analysis, which in actuality, is fairly far from the mark. The compendium of animalia in the ship's library reveals it a 'northern raccoon', also remarking that is 'quite edible.'","800551":"<b>The snapping trap is weak and flimsy.</b> The crew are excited by a sharp sound, but rush to the scene, only to find the bait gone, and the trap in disrepair. A piece of bright red felt caught in the spring explains all. 'Klabautermann!' they despair, for it is a terrible omen to offend a sea goblin as they have done.","800552":"<b>The crew don't have much belief,</b> and the priest makes a hash of the exorcism. If anything, his fragmented delivery only agitates the creature. The next night, a sailor is adamant he has sighted something 'irrefutably demonic.'","800553":"<b>The faithless crew never take any part of the exorcism seriously.</b> 'What's the point of hocus-pocus when its but greedy sailors stealing?!' yells one man. Accusations fly between conspiracy theorists, until a violent brawl breaks out. At the next mooring, the injured parties desert your godless expedition.","800554":"Gather arms and confront it","800555":"Sate the demon with a sacrificial offering","800556":"Don't anger the creature further","800557":"<b>Rather excessive.</b> The soldiery tense as strange noises draw near. Fingers itch upon triggers. The moment demon wings flap into view, the night is lit up with powder. Finally the smoke subsides, and the mangled thing is revealed to be nothing more than a bat. Troops thunder heavily about the ship, before discovering the rest of the hog-nosed critters in the hold. Everyone is left feeling utterly stupid.","800558":"<b>Your lily-livered cowards quiver like jelly!</b> Fear chokes them as they spin wildly about looking for something to shoot that they can't see. Two are so panicked they bump together, causing the other to suddenly fire. Shot hits an angelic young sailor, killing instantly. The night terror is gone, but has taken for payment the most undeserving of souls.","800559":"<b>A man's finger for a stowaway weasel!</b> In good faith, a pious sailor volunteers the pinkie of his right hand as a votive offering. But at the smell of blood, it is a slinky little mustelid that appears. With the weasel caught and caged, the night terror is over, but the sailors will not forgive or forget the loss of a good man's finger.","800560":"<b>Sacrilege!</b> A prohibited tome is consulted, the vile solicitations of its pages consuming the crew! Unspeakable acts are performed upon a man, so that the demon can be assuaged. Yet still the menace remains, and worse, the crew's sacrificial victim bleeds out from his injuries.","800561":"<b>The practical joke is ruined.</b> The bored sailors bemoan the pathetic response to their little entertainment. That the senior officers have been duped by an obvious ruse, makes all severely doubt their fitness to lead.","800563":"<b>Your sharp-nosed hunters pick up a scent.</b> Pungent droppings demarcate a perimeter, in the centre of which is a crate with a hole. A sailor reaches his arm bravely in. There is a brief struggle, and a whine like the ones at night, before the troublemaker is pulled out. It is a common garden fox. The cunning little creature becomes the crew's talisman for the remainder of the expedition.","800564":"<b>Hunters find tracks, but can't say what made them.</b> The marks are indeed strange - disturbing almost. Claw marks that go deep in the decking, as if the unspeakable thing that made them was in some frenzy.","800565":"<b>The hunters stumble guilelessly into its trap.</b> The night is unfeasibly pitch, and the hunters' lamps extinguish. Who knows why, without a breath of wind? A scratching draws near. Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence. Just like that, the fiend has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed.","800566":"Smoke it out of hiding","800567":"Build a trap to catch whatever it is","800568":"Pray together against the spirit","800569":"<b>Reassuringly human coughing comes from within.</b> It turns out you have a stowaway - a young girl wishing to escape a life of hardship. She is spirited., and the crew take to her quickly. She is given work to do, and food to eat. All believe she shall prove their good luck charm.","800570":"<b>Knowing its habits helps.</b> The box is made to measure, and along with its clever latch, is placed where the fiend seems most often to be. The box is found in the morning, with a gigantic rat inside it. The trap appears to have killed it, and that is the end of the matter.","800571":"<b>The ramshackle trap box is in bits the next morning.</b> While to some they appear benign, the claw marks appear more frequently. Once a man wakes with his cheeks gouged. Some are so perturbed by the night demon, that they slink off the ship at the next available harbour.","800572":"<b>A feeling of calm descends upon the crew.</b> The prayer seems to fill the spiritual void in the sailor's breasts. Approaching the world with a new perspective means even if the unexplained episodes at night persist, they pay it no mind.","800573":"<b>The communal prayer is broken by more wild shrieking.</b> It matters not that, apart from vanishing supplies, the mischievous spirit seems fairly harmless. The crew are deeply troubled, and worry their souls are lost.","800574":"<b>The menace is very persistent.</b> Restless nights, devoured food, and stolen supplies shall go unexplained and unresolved for the remainder of the expedition. The crew are at their wit's end.","800575":"Lost in the Desert","800576":"<b>The map of these endless dunes is a swindle.</b> The first officer turns to berate the guide from whom they were purchased, but the fellow is already gone, as if the sands had swallowed him up. A solitary well offers a slight dribble of consolation, but your men must otherwise come to terms with being rather lost.","800577":"Use a reflective object to signal help","800578":"Navigate by the stars","800579":"Wait for a sign of the true path","800580":"Walk stubbornly in one direction","800581":"<b>A local rider comes to the rescue.</b> He saunters over on his camel, and explains the well is part of a lost city, accessible over a small rise. The crew are enchanted by the grand quarry, swept over by the sands of time, observations of which shall no doubt bring them fame on their return. After proof of their remarkable discovery has been gathered, the rider is only too glad to lead the elated crew back to more familiar dunes.","800582":"<b>Clear desert nights are perfect for astronomers.</b> Beneath a black cloak lucid with the constellations, your expert navigators school the remainder in mankind's relation to the heavenly bodies. It is a moment of realisation for many. Enlightened, the crew return to the ship filled with the wonder of the desert and their place in the universe.","800583":"<b>Something of a path appears</b>, though as much by luck as star-gazing. A little way along it, a silhouette crenellates the night - an imposing fortress. Too tired for trouble, you wonder if it is worth knocking at the grand door.","800584":"<b>The \"stars are fickle\", say your officers by way of excuse.</b> After travelling for a while, the familiar shape of the well appears in the darkness. Your men have been walking in a circle.","800585":"<b>The stars utterly perplex your party.</b> With romantic notions dashed, the crew look around for some landmark, but instead find a featureless wasteland. They are desperately lost. Water, food and hope are in increasingly short supply. But even in a desert, there must be a way...","800586":"Ask at the fort for help","800587":"Ignore the fort and continue along the path","800588":"<b>The occupant Sultan welcomes you in.</b> He introduces himself in his own tongue, and is impressed by your interpreters. \"You are far from what you seek. Stay, replenish for the journey ahead.\" Thus the crew enjoy the Sultan's hospitality while they can, for it will ease the last stretch of their journey.","800589":"<b>You lack the means to communicate.</b> Believing you to be an invasion force, the paranoid Sultan orders hot oil be poured from the ramparts. There is no escaping for one, eaten alive by the molten cascade. Resuming your desert path is the only option. The journey is a wearying lament for a fallen friend, meandering slowly back to civilisation.","800590":"<b>It is a long and draining journey.</b> Finally the crew limp exhausted into a settlement, from where it will no doubt be possible to procure the appropriate charts. Most would be happy never to see those grumpy old camels ever again.","800591":"Follow the local wildlife","800592":"Divine for Water","800593":"Move bravely on","800594":"<b>Desperate thanks are due to a dung beetle.</b> As it scuttles along, those less capable in coleopterology cast doubt on the value of pursuing it. There is a minor scuffle in the sand before at last the bloody-nosed experts are listened to. The jolly beetle leads to owl dung, and owls in turn to farmland. Thus the embittered and exhausted crew are saved from desiccation.","800595":"<b>A wild goose chase to desolation.</b> Though the ostrich your crew have found cannot fly, it lollops along at surprisingly high speed. They try in vain to follow, but the sun is twice its usual size, and the bird is gone. Hot sand melts soles, and feet begin to swell. The water is out. Those that make it must have some evolutionary adaptation, because for most the desert is to be their graveyard.","800596":"<b>Your reprobates have no knowledge of desert mysteries.</b> The divining rod has wasted enough of your time, and your caravan is nearly through the water.","800597":"<b>A pretty price for divine mercy.</b> The Y-shaped stick leads all on a meandering path. One insists on stopping to dig, and is left behind. It is a wasted, and fatal effort. After two days of hardship, the rest stumble over a crest to discover the wide blue sea, their mocking ship upon it.","800598":"<b>The sun is unspeakably hot.</b> As the bedraggled lumber back to civilisation, there are wiltings among them. It is too much for the others to turn their heads. Bodies slumping to ash and dust, lost to the waves of a powder sea.","800599":"<b>Star of wonder, star of light!</b> Your wise magi are stirred by an unusually bright celestial body, that is surely a sign! It foretells a spiritual pilgrimage through the desert leading to a Garden of Eden. A grove of flowing streams, orange and incense, where like-minded devotees congregate. Your crew feel blessed, and the expedition can resume with new-found devotion.","800600":"<b>Are the gods testing you?</b> You wait and wait but there is not yet a sign.","800601":"<b>The omen is a ravaging howl.</b> \"Water in the desert?! it's coming from everywhere!\" Already up to their necks in strong current, the weak swimmers flounder like ants in a bathtub. Those that do not drown must wait until morning to look upon the aftermath. \"A flood from heaven, to punish the wicked,\" say the survivors, as they trudge back to civilisation.","800602":"<b>You are extremely lucky to survive.</b> The crew whinge and whine the whole way about scattergun strategy. After a day without shade, a fight even breaks out. But sticking to the fixed heading eventually leads, not before time, back to some kind of reality.","800603":"<b>Your expedition boils.</b> Further and further it goes, into the desert's incandescent interior. Each soul more and more convinced that redemption is over the next dune. But it is not. Three days later, the party might have felt relief at the sight of a caravan, but instead end up wishing they had died with their comrades.","800605":"A Grizzly Encounter","800606":"<b>Bear attack!</b> The party ponder this very real possibility as threatening grunts stop them dead among the firs. Fifty yards ahead, a huge specimen lurches up on two legs like a totem, standing between them and escape. More grunting echoes nearby. The party stay silent, awaiting guidance.","800607":"Scare the bears away","800608":"Use hunting knowledge to get the better of the bears","800609":"Attack the bear blocking the way","800610":"Use camouflage","800611":"<b>Boooooom!</b> The valley shudders with the sweet stench of exploded dynamite. The bears hurry away, leaving the crew thoroughly entertained at the superiority of mankind and the power of invention.","800612":"<b>Trust in the expert hunters never feels misplaced</b>, even when they recommend the party break into passionate song. For singing the shanty 'Cheerly-ay-oh' brings the crew together, whilst also dispersing the wary bears deep into the forest.","800613":"<b>The hunters lack guile.</b> They have enough to lead the crew on a route silent as a church, but not enough to stop a bear sniffing them out. It's easy to believe from its vacant eyes, that it sees you as a potentially delicious kind of threat.","800614":"<b>Call themselves hunters!</b> The tracks thought to lead away from bear territory go instead to a clearing at its heart. The bears at first seem alarmed their picnic is disturbed, until they realise your crew are on the menu. The sound of crunching bone rings in the ears of the few that manage to flee.","800615":"Attack the bear","800616":"Outmanoeuvre the bear","800617":"<b>The bear's face proves a good target.</b> Ducking the terrifying whooshes of its paws, someone manages to prime their pistol and shoot it through the eye. The bear drops dead. No-one feels particularly good about killing it, but the way ahead is now clear.","800618":"<b>Adaptation is good when a fight isn't going well.</b> The bear flinches but does not drop after the first round of gunfire. There is no time to reload, before it is upon them with its paws. Knocked down the men are smart enough to play dead. After an hour or so facing the floor, the bears lose interest and leave. The crew are able to lick their wounds, and move on.","800619":"<b>It's easy to underestimate mummy bears.</b> As the soldiers fluff the loading of their weapons, the bear nonchalantly grasps one by the wrist, and sinks her jaw into his neck. The others panic and flee with their arms in the air. She pursues a second, striking him dead against a rock. Now she and her cubs can finally be left in peace.","800620":"<b>Sometimes it helps to know your hill contours.</b> The crew carefully fall away, circumventing the bear's position, and keeping their backs to the mountainside. With the higher ground, the bear appears to lose interest. Hearts pumping, the crew hurry to safety.","800621":"<b>Stupidly the crew decide to run, and reach a dead-end.</b> The bear pursues at a leisurely speed, yet with no less menace, and the crew are forced to seek refuge in a cave, or else try climbing the trees.","800623":"Hide in the cave and pray","800624":"Climb the trees","800625":"<b>Against all anxiety, the Bear doesn't follow.</b> Still, the men in the cave are too afraid to light a fire, or sleep through the night. Shattered and hungry, they emerge the next morning, only to find their sacrifice was wholly unnecessary.","800626":"<b>Bears can see terribly well in the dark</b>, and since your crew have stumbled into its house, where its vulnerable infants sleep, it is not very happy. The crew that do manage to break for daylight have clothes ragged and torn, and cannot speak, for it is clear they were the lucky ones.","800627":"<b>The crew climb the trees well enough</b>, but the bear isn't going to make their lives easy. It is a full day and night before it gives up shaking trunks, or climbing halfway up towards the dangling crew. When it finally leaves, the exhausted crew descend, their nerves in shreds.","800628":"<b>Bears are awfully good at climbing trees</b>, and as on this occasion, it is not uncommon to see them strike their adversaries from the branches. Its hapless victim plunges from the canopy and lands like a sack of red berries on rocks below. Others injure themselves as the men drop from the trees in a desperate escape.","800629":"<b>The lone bear's haunch is picked out with expert marksmanship.</b> It staggers before bounding off into the woods. Your crew are delighted to return to the safety of the ship, whilst also having done the mighty beast no lasting harm.","800630":"<b>The first volley of shots miss</b>, and the bear attacks. A second shot finds its mark, and the wounded bear escapes into the trees, but a man lies dead. His brother cries revenge, and is already off into the woods to hunt the grisly killer.","800631":"<b>Out here, bears rule.</b> The wildly inaccurate gunfire serves only to rile the bear into a frenzy, and draw attention to your position. Then a second, larger bear thunders from the undergrowth and mauls a man to death. A few of your piffling soldiery manage to escape with all their limbs attached.","800632":"Track the wounded bear with him","800633":"Leave the fool behind","800634":"<b>Bittersweet.</b> Your fine tracking skills allow the crew to catch up with the bear and watch it from hiding. It is a she-bear, and is now nuzzling its young cubs. 'That is why she killed him,' says the brother, gone all vitriol. 'Let us leave, and hope my brother's spirit may somehow live on in this place.'","800635":"<b>The hot-headed hunt is a success none celebrate.</b> Once found, the bear no longer has strength to defend itself. As the brother drives a stake into its heart, it gives over with a last sad sigh. In that moment a tiny cub pads into the open, crawling weakly under the limp arm of its mother. If only they had understood, the crew could have saved the heartache.","800636":"<b>Hunting is impossible with passions running this high.</b> When another man snaps a twig, the vengeful brother attacks him wildly, and the others fail to intervene. The brother's eyes glaze as he slides to the earth, bayonet in his back.","800637":"<b>The decision is unpopular.</b> 'Stubborn 'til the end,' say those in the minority. But the greater part have things to say on the subject of dishonour. 'Those brothers loved each other to the end,' remarks one old sailor, 'and what little love did we show for them...'","800638":"<b>The bears have no chance.</b> Indeed, the camouflage is so good, the crew can barely see one another! Thickly daubed in the colours of the forest, the chameleon crew bypass the bears with ease. A story of ingenuity at which their grandchildren shall marvel!","800639":"<b>Even the most hardened sailors find the smell unbearable.</b> Not to mention the indignity of covering oneself in bear excrement for longer than is perfectly necessary. Eventually though the bears depart, leaving the reeking crew free to have a much-needed wash.","800640":"<b>Dressing as pantomime trees is a bad idea</b>, and as the bears attack, the flimsy branches the crew intended to cover their faces prove no more effective in self-defence. The ensuing scene might have made for an impressive spectacle on the stage, though only as the most gruesome of tragedies.","800658":"The locals look expectant","800659":"Deal","800660":"No Deal","800663":"The Seven-Year Itch","800664":"<b>The crew are beset by insatiable and painful itching!</b> From lieutenants down to pigeon-keepers, they twist and turn in their bunks and cannot sleep. It is affecting their capacity to carry out the most basic duties, something must be done!","800665":"Wash more often!","800666":"Analyse the symptoms","800667":"Find somewhere to stop and be rid of it","800668":"Let them itch, it's common at sea","800669":"<b>Washing a splendid idea at sea? Who knew?!</b> The itching is very soon forgotten, as the sailors cavort through rainbows of expurgating bubbles. The rich perfume below deck is a welcome reminder of family and bygone days.","800670":"<b>'Only jellyfish!' says the cultivated doctor cheerfully.</b> 'Our refreshing swim at that cove appears to be the cause. It must have been rife with their larvae!' The crew marvel at the clever diagnosis, and as the itching subsides, bask in the pioneering case-study they have performed for the benefit of humankind.","800671":"<b>The red welts seem to perplex the doctor.</b> 'There is evidence of the parasitic,' he splutters as he peers through his magnifying glass, 'but then it could be nothing at all!'","800672":"<b>The doctor is a demented quack.</b> When the condition is established correctly as crusted scabies - contagious, but hardly dangerous - the doctor's experiment is for the affected to bathe in an acid solution. Needless to say, his victims do not survive their injuries. When the expedition returns, it is entirely possible he may be stripped of his profession.","800673":"Examine the cabins for some sort of parasite","800674":"Have the afflicted bathe in holy water","800675":"<b>There are bedbugs everywhere!</b> There must be something that can be done to exterminate these disc-bodied hangers-on!","800676":"<b>They cannot see the wood for the trees!</b> Evidence of fleas would be everywhere to the right pair of eyes. Two weeks pass, and murine typhus breaks out. Rashes, fever and vomiting grip the fleas' hosts, who are never able to find the cause of their itching agony.","800677":"Refurbish the cabins","800678":"Simply change the sheets","800679":"<b>The matter is craftily 'put-to-bed'.</b> Despite the time-consuming upheaval, the crew are surprised to have their cabins so well refurbished. 'They're too soft on us,' says a jolly cove inspecting the new bunks, but my britches haven't itched all day.'","800680":"<b>What dreary decor!'</b> says the Lieutenant tartly. Matters deteriorate when some ill-fashioned bunks collapse. 'I'd rather have the itching back,' says an exhausted-looking sailor. Like others, he has to sleep out on the hard decking, until some competent craftsmen can come aboard.","800681":"<b>It is a job half-done.</b> For most the problem goes away, but some must live with the itching. Wherever the bugs' nasty little hidey-hole is, it must still reel with lousy punters, each telling stories of the sailor blood they drained the night before.","800682":"<b>The priest's most divine bottle does the trick.</b> 'This water is indeed holy!' he says, as the fearsome muscovite vodka from 1791 is uncorked and slapped over the itches of the queuing sailors. 'Shame to use it like this, but I'd rather sleep,' he cackles.","800683":"<b>'Is nothing sacred anymore?'</b> Says the priest, who turns up his nose at the suggestion of using his water for something so humdrum. 'The lord hath bigger fish to fry,' he says pointedly. As well as the vile and incessant itching, the crew now have a parsimonious priest to contend with.","800684":"<b>Sand and sun is a panacea!</b> An acute sense of direction leads the ship to an island paradise. A freshwater lagoon relieves the itching, and the much-needed relaxation will stand all in good stead for the journey ahead.","800685":"<b>Bringing contagion to port might be a bad idea.</b> The itching is at its worst by the time the expedition reaches the bustling alien seaport, something the local authorities don't fail to notice. The harbour-master's tug escorts you to quarantine. How do you escape?","800686":"<b>It's impossible for your aimless navigators to concentrate.</b> The expedition fidgets wildly off course, with no land in sight. Meanwhile the assassin bugs continue to spread their dreadful disease. Even they'd probably make better navigators! Then there wouldn't have to be quite so much death!","800687":"Lie that the sickness isn't contagious","800688":"Threaten them into letting you go","800689":"Await quarantine","800690":"<b>The lie works like a charm.</b> A doctor promptly comes aboard to confirm this hypothesis. Although she sternly points out the condition is contagious after all, she also recognises it to be a mild complaint. 'Crabs,' the translator says, face flushing. The crew are too relieved to feel embarrassed.","800692":"<b>It is obvious you are lying,</b> and the authorities are not impressed. They allow several days to pass, without any word on your ship's release, adversely affecting the morale of your crew.","800693":"<b>They don't want any trouble.</b> A doctor comes aboard ship and goes nervously about his business. Although the atmosphere is somewhat cagey, medicines for your crew's skin conditions are provided, and the expedition can continue on its way.","800694":"<b>You underestimate them.</b> Two surprise warships hove round the landspit and close in to firing range. There is no choice but to run. As your ship crashes wildly out between jetties, the escort ship pincers, and opens fire. The effect is catastrophic. Your modest vessel flees in tatters, and many good sailors are dead or wounded. For the rest, the itching is set to continue.","800695":"<b>It's a long time before the authorities deal with you,</b> with bureaucracy seemingly a way of life here. When you finally have access to a medical professional, there is already a post-mortem to be conducted. It appears chemicals leeched into the water supply and caused the rashes and sickness. With the water changed, the others recover, but it cannot redeem the loss of a life.","800696":"<b>It is a particularly awful itch however.</b> The disgusting lice infesting the ship, and discomfort thereof has many questioning the worth of your expedition. There is only so much scratching a crew can take before they lose all appetite for the journey ahead.","800698":"<b>Widespread suspicion is the undesirable outcome.</b> Ignorance of the full circumstances surrounding the death has the crew feeling powerless. You must accept that quarrels and accusations will now be routine until the end of this expedition.","800875":"Parasitic Infestation","800877":"<b>These parasites must have come from the marsh goo;</b> all that waist-high wading. Now they nestle deep in your crew, who, at risk of harm from their own madcap cures, really need professional help!","800878":"Bathe them in alcohol","800879":"Treat the afflicted","800880":"Hope the problem goes away","800881":"<b>A delectable disinfectant!</b> The suffering take immense pleasure scouring themselves in a whacking great tub of the stuff. Indeed, so diverting is this new form of alcohol absorption, that even those without parasites take turns.","800882":"<b>The doctor concocts a panacea</b>, which not only purges the belly-dwelling roundworm, but more besides. Garlic, wormwood, and lemon quietly see off a myriad other complaints of your spoon-dodging sailors.","800883":"<b>The doctors disagree.</b> 'Madam! Bloodletting gives our patients only a fifty-fifty chance!' says one. 'Sir, tinctures are seldom beneficial OR effective on parasites!' says the other.","800884":"<b>It does go away, eventually.</b> 'My arm looked like a wormcake for a while,' one sailor laments, 'but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war.'","800885":"<b>Mass amputation for all?!</b> The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone! Limbs must be chopped, or else their bodies shall rattle with bemaggoted cavities!","800886":"Try the latest tincture","800887":"Risk bloodletting the patients","800888":"Let nature take its course","800889":"<b>A fine placebo.</b> As if by magic, the intestinal worms lose the will to go on. The doctor freely admits this is more likely down to positive patient attitude, than his revolting tincture.","800890":"<b>The unpleasant medicine doesn't help.</b> Constant trips to the privy are now the only release for your bug-ridden crew. The doctor admits to the failure of the tincture, but thankfully has something for diarrhoea.","800891":"The tincture is poison! Having seen their first shipmate choke on his dose, the rest decide they'd rather live with a six-foot tapeworm in their bellies.","800892":"<b>Somehow it works</b>, and the patients are rid of the parasite. The doctor seems unsurprised, 'human physiology may be complex, but treatment need not be.' A pretty vague case summary, but who cares?!","800893":"<b>Perfect preparation for amputation!</b> At least that's what your crazed doctor would have you believe. Once her macabre experiment is concluded there is surely only one course of action for the afflicted...the crew are aghast.","800894":"<b>It does go away, eventually.</b> 'My arm looked like a wormcake for a while,' one sailor laments, 'but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war.'","800895":"<b>Mass amputation for all?!</b> The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone! Limbs must be chopped, or else their bodies shall rattle with bemaggoted cavities!","800898":"Have the doctor amputate","800900":"Let nature take its course","800901":"<b>As good as could be expected.</b> Out with parasites, in with polished peg legs and helpful hook-hands. The crew look not nearly as enthusiastic as you might think however.","800902":"<b>Extraordinary that you trusted that quack!</b> She is sideshow surgeon, carving up her victims with the zeal of a ripper, and the accuracy of a pissing schoolboy. At least the screams will die away soon enough...","800903":"<b>Nothing can save them.</b> Though a mercy that they may choose their manner of death - unmolested by the ship's quack - it is death nonetheless. The parasite has sucked the life from your expedition.","800932":"The Icy Blizzard","800933":"<b>Trapped in the snow!</b> When the furious blizzard relents, the exploration party see the mountain pass ahead is blocked. Some say the rough terrain can be crossed, others say they saw a small fork in the path not too far back.","800934":"Blow up the freeze ahead","800935":"Craft something to traverse the terrain","800936":"Take the fork you passed","800937":"Await help","800938":"<b>The crew feel happy awe</b>, at the resulting avalanche. There, as the pass beyond is revealed, they swear they see something lurching away. Giant and hirsute, it leaves no print but in the imagination.","800939":"<b>The skis are highly effective.</b> Simply fashioned, and with a clever coating of paraffin. Some prove expert skiers, glissading with a flourish to the finish line, but all make it to the bottom. The whole thing has turned out to be a good bit of fun.","800943":"<b>It is not much of a detour.</b> The going is steady and before long the warm fire of the base camp appears in view. The blizzard is something to tell the grandchildren, provided frostbite hasn't seen to that...","800944":"<b>The path is both steep and perilous.</b> A narrow ledge along a sheer cliff lies ahead. Some men are ready to give up. All the while a strange noise keens below the gnashing gale.","800945":"<b>A far more treacherous path</b>, but your crew are committed now. A steep cliff ahead must be negotiated, and your ropes are too short.","800946":"<b>Shelter is minimal.</b> Huddling cannot keep out the cold. When a rescue party arrives with equipment the next morning, they find men frostbitten and hypothermic. Not all of them will survive the journey down.","800947":"<b>Toboggans are better where it's flat.</b> Though solidly made, the going is fast. One sled veers into a ravine. A cry below: 'Officer injured', but the wind is picking up.","800948":"<b>The clumsy snowshoes fail you.</b> Whether it is in their design or construction, every step sinks the party deeper. The cold will claim lives before the storm is weathered.","800949":"Descend and help the officer","800951":"Hope they manage alone","800952":"<b>The doctor works quickly.</b> Just what is needed with another blizzard brewing. 'Temporary strapping,' he says, 'but should get us home.' The officer and rest of the party make shelter with little time left to spare.","800953":"<b>The doctor knows nothing of urgency.</b> 'Give my patient space!' he snaps at those trying to move things along. Meanwhile, a blizzard sweeps the ravine, and the onset of frostbite is enough to split the party. Neither the doctor nor his unfortunate patient are to be seen again.","800954":"<b>You knew deep down not all would make it.</b> 'They're all returned but the injured fellow,' comes the news. 'There was no saving him, the way he was. Ice stripped the meat from his bones like a chef's mandorre.'","800955":"Follow the divine voice","800956":"Urge your party to face their fears","800957":"<b>A heavenly, enlightened voice calls.</b> None stop to look down, so enchanted are they. Over a verge, appears a shrine with a great bell - the source of the sound - and beyond, a pilgrims' path to the foot of the mountain.","800958":"<b>A non-believer falls to his death.</b> 'Those lacking conviction shall be tried and judged in this place,' echoes the priest. The rest edge to safety, consoled by the apparent goodness in their hearts.","800960":"<b>Nothing but a demonic howl.</b> The blizzard rises anew. Without hope to keep them aloft, it is no surprise when a ledge gives way, damning to hell below.","800961":"<b>A song of solidarity rises through the line of snow-crusted faces.</b> Clinging to what they most cherish, they edge to safety. Had they not been reminded of such incentives, it is doubtful they would have survived.","800962":"<b>Only some take strength.</b> The rest remain in a frozen huddle. They may have lacked courage to negotiate the high ledge, but will welcome in their icy death with creditable stoicism.","800964":"Free climb","800965":"Craft longer ropes and swing down","800966":"<b>All are saved, at a cost.</b> Putting the ropes together is quite a task with frozen fingers. That the party are able to cling to the rope as they descend is a small miracle. Nevertheless, frostbite will do lasting damage to their digits.","800967":"<b>A small but critical detail is overlooked.</b> Grip. A man falls from the top of the rope with a cry, tumbling those below him into the abyss like meat from a skewer. Only a few frozen grimaces survive.","800968":"<b>It is a risky business.</b> Though the cliff isn't lacking in handholds, this is a test of individual endurance. Some were never going to be up to it. As they fall, the will to survive in the others strengthens.","800972":"Baptism of Fire","800973":"<b>Everything points towards the fiery gate.</b> It appears like a hallucination, an ancient stone doorway suffused with blue flame set into the rock face. Perhaps a long lost people constructed it, as a shortcut through the high ridge dividing the region. Your men consider it an auspicious sign, and would like to enter it, but perhaps it would be safer to take the long way through the dense jungle.","800974":"Have the scientist inspect the gate","800975":"Have faith and leap through the flames","800976":"Wrap up in something before leaping through","800977":"Cut through the jungle instead","800978":"<b>The scientist banishes the illusion.</b> \"The fire that you perceive around the gate is simply an agglomeration of azure glow-worms.\" Laughter becomes delight, as the party take the pulsing creatures in hand. Indeed, they are of great help in navigating the dark tunnel to the far side of the ridge, saving you days of trekking.","800979":"<b>If anything the flames are cool</b>, like bundles of ribbons brushing the skin. This gate is, without question, an earthly manifestation of the divine, for not far along the tunnel, the light breaks in once more, and your party arrive on the far side of the ridge, spiritually tranquil, and having saved days of trekking.","800980":"<b>Some of the crew remain doubtful.</b> Drawing a little closer to the gate, they are surprised to feel no heat coming from the fire. One leap of faith and they would be through! Still, they hesitate, for a perfect human skeleton lies just the other side of the threshold.","800981":"<b>Alas! Fire and brimstone!</b> Some of the crew seem entranced by the glowing entrance. The temperatures are volcanic, but the diabolic procession of fanatics are numb to the pain. The others watch horrified, as fabric, skin and flesh renders before their eyes. It makes the long way round seem a miracle of mercy. ","800982":"Try to determine how the person died","800983":"Order them to charge through!","800984":"<b>The doctor forms a decent hypothesis</b>, and the crew are convinced. \"Even from afar, I can see the bones are in poor condition; not burned, but malnourished.\" Anxious not to end up the same way, the crew take a gamble, and are astonished to discover that leaping through the gate does them no harm. They follow the tunnel to the other side of the ridge. \"I wonder if it was those frogs we licked...\" the doctor mumbles.","800985":"<b>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</b> Your doctor makes several sweeping assumptions, finally concluding, \"exhaustion, I'm quite certain. That they died at this particular place is only a coincidence.\" As the first volunteer crosses the threshold, flames grasp his ankles, then shoot rapidly up and over his body. He drops upon the stone floor, taking his place beside the last poor fool. Horrified, your expedition must go the long way round. ","800986":"<b>\"Ouch!\"</b> The men yelp, rolling in the stone passageway beyond, until they are sure they are no longer aflame. With the strange gate behind them, your brave soldiers compare their ugly burns as they march through the tunnel to the far side of the ridge.  ","800987":"<b>\"Cowards!\"</b> Your men lack the discipline to follow a simple order! You will have to find another way.","800988":"<b>They make it.</b> Rolled-up like carpets, they skip over the strange and fiery threshold. As they wend their way through the passage to the other side of the ridge, their worst complaint is the overwhelmingly sweet pong of sweat that is sure to follow them for the rest of the journey. Still, all remain curious as to what that gate really was.","800989":"<b>\"That he died like a sausage?!</b> What else can I tell his family!?\" Either way, your volunteer leapt through the fire and paid with his life. Who knows — perhaps dousing his mantlecoat in a protective layer of paraffin was a mistake! Your expedition will have to trudge the miserable way round.","800990":"<b>The crew have no regrets</b> in plotting what they perceive to be a safer, more rational course. Sweaty jungles are the devil they know, snakes and spiders notwithstanding. They make good time, and soon find a shallow incline that leads them up and over to the far side of the ridge. Still, many are curious to know what sorcery was governing the gate they saw. ","800991":"<b>The jungle thins out to a precipice,</b> which seems to form part of the ridge you are trying to cross. A long and shoddy-looking bridge stretches to the other side, if you want to risk it, or else you could attempt to take an even larger detour. ","800992":"<b>There is no way through,</b> thanks to your shambolic map reading, as the jungle grows thicker and danker. The group tire, having many disagreements, and separate into factions. The sensible ones stick together, and decide the only realistic option is to backtrack for several weeks. The rest will die among the roots and ferns.","800993":"Take the bridge","800994":"Circumnavigate the ridge","800995":"<b>Inspection shows it to be in passable condition.</b> There are a few nerve-wracking moments during the crossing, as the wind whips up and the rickety bridge begins to sway. In any case, all are rather pleased to reach the other side, from which they succeed in reaching the far side of the ridge.","800996":"<b>Only a fool would ever set foot on it!</b> Of course, it's nothing if not dramatic as the bridge cables twang, and one after the other, your men pile into the gorge. The craftsmen who had been so very confident in the deathtrap structure's safety choose hang back in shame, as the expedition sorrowfully wends the long way round the ridge.","800997":"<b>It is a long trek</b>, yet one that could have been so much longer were it not for some sound map reading and compass work. The vegetation is thick and stubborn. Your expedition hacks their way through with irritation, marking yet another hiccup for the expedition log book.","800998":"<b>Imbecile orienteers!</b> There's no way to cross this river valley for a hundred miles! You've covered half that distance before you realise, but having wasted a lot of time and provisions, your men may as well see this major boo-boo through. It takes almost three weeks of struggle before your expedition is back on track. ","801001":"The Mysterious Artefacts","801002":"<b>The discovery of several strange artefacts aboard spooks the crew.</b> Tied to the rigging, bunks, boards, and even atop the captain's desk. A warning, a threat? And who put them there? Since the nearby island is uninhabited, it is sensible only to think the perpetrator must be aboard. The crew must know or have seen something last night!","801003":"Ask the anthropologist","801004":"Ask the crew who did this","801005":"Throw them overboard and move on.","801006":"<b>'For good luck,'</b> remarks the anthropologist, inspecting the spherical red dolls, 'for the setting of goals, and perseverance in achieving them. Some people or spirit of this place believe they can help us home.' At this, your crew are beguiled.","801007":"<b>Your crew are beginning to bond.</b> Someone comes forward, not having expected to cause such a bother. 'They're for me old mum,' he sighs, 'birds - that one's a little robin. Made 'em together when she was ill. Now she's gone...I...' The others are quick to put an arm round his shoulder; they're all in this together.","801008":"<b>No one has anything to offer but the priest.</b> It is his belief that some unholy chapter has opened. The next morning, more of the eerie things have appeared. 'Cleanse the idols in holy fire!' he shrieks. 'Nonsense,' says a soldier. \"Set guards within, and we shall have this rat.\"","801009":"<b>A destructive episode.</b> No one has information, or perhaps they withhold it. Consensus tends towards the latter. Someone wants this expedition to fail, and these effigies are a threat. Paranoia festers. At the next port, a large part of the crew opts to quit.","801010":"<b>Chilling.</b> As instructed, the crew collect the dolls and throw them overboard. But relief lasts only until the following morning, when the dolls are found returned, placed exactly as they had been.","801011":"Side with the priest and prepare a holy fire","801012":"Keep guard and capture the perpetrator","801013":"<b>The priest gloats over his success.</b> With a maniacal grin, he sets the mound of idols alight. The fire consumes rapidly, shifting vermillion to viridian. Some say they hear the wood scream as it goes. 'Expurgation is God's work, and I am chosen.'","801014":"<b>The fire is chaotic</b>, and the buckets of water seem not to extinguish, but provoke. The flame leaps to the priest's cassock like spring-heeled jack, and as it sweeps up his back, he is heard to utter his last words, 'forgive me father, for I have sinned.'","801015":"<b>The teenagers are remorseful.</b> 'It was a jape, a piece o' trickery sirs, we regret t'were not received so.' The crew are forgiving - the youths merely wished to contain their homesickness - and call for just fifty strokes of the birch per bottom.","801016":"<b>That night, dire musket-shot is heard.</b> A dead boy on deck, local. A second is seen diving to blue. Next morning a rhythm comes from an armada of river boats, armed with guns. There island is inhabited, and they know what you have done.","801017":"<b>The sun is solemn that morning.</b> The bodies of the dead guards are borne to the hold for burial, but not here, upon this cursed rock. Who killed them none know but the sinister effigies. The expedition fumbles on.","801018":"Engage in battle.","801019":"Leave immediately","801020":"<b>One warning salvo is enough.</b> The river boats cluster and slow. Though they lower their weapons and allow you to leave, the anger that your crime goes unpunished couldn't be more marked in their faces.","801021":"<b>Your ship is a sitting duck.</b> Your crew cannot man stations fast enough to fire or manoeuvre. Enemy boats surround your ship, before scaling its sides. The blood shed on both sides will stain this ship and expedition forever.","801022":"<b>Once your ship is underway she is free.</b> Nevertheless your adversaries are excellent shots, and do damage to the sails and aft. The crew will have to make repairs in the days that follow.","801023":"<b>A traumatic escape.</b> In the hurry to leave, your ship is spun broadside and exposed to gunfire. There are injuries, but none so deep as the sight of the dead boy's accomplice below. He weeps, and clutches one of the idols - a good luck charm.","801025":"Dockyard Dupe","801026":"<b>Robbed!</b> Having thanked the generous innkeeper, your ship departed what seemed a most hospitable port. Even at the time, your crew were surprised to see so many smiling faces gather at the dock to wave you off. A mere hour into the onward journey, however, it's discovered that a great deal of valuable property is missing from the hold. You must now decide if it's worth going back for.","801027":"Have your detective investigate","801028":"Return and plunder the Harbour","801029":"Return to the inn in disguise and bait the robbers","801030":"Appeal to the local authorities","801031":"Take the loss on the chin","801032":"<b>The detective already knows the culprit.</b> \"I was waiting to see if our crew were complicit, but I am satisfied they are not.\" Your ship returns and lays out a watertight case to the local authorities, incriminating the local innkeeper. He is arrested, your equipment is returned and your ship receives a resupply. It seems that hospitality was genuine after all!","801033":"<b>Swift justice.</b> The petty harbour defences crumble in the morning light. Your ship streaks unopposed into what remains of the smouldering harbour, and turns its guns upon the harbourmaster's office. \"Please, take anything!\" he yelps, \"You'll find all your things in the warehouse, and more besides.\" You profit from a scheme that has been running for years.","801034":"<b>Your assault is too slow.</b> Just as you begin to gain the upper hand over the defenders, the cavalry appear. Cannons pop from the west; a slew of artillery reinforcements. ","801035":"<b>An absolute shambles.</b> Your men couldn't even best a few locals with a primitive demi-cannon. \"Who shall have our guts for garters next?\" yelp those who survive the barrage, \"A small gang of angry turtles?\" Your ship sails hurriedly away.","801036":"Fight them all","801037":"<b>You put an end to the corruption!</b> Brought to their knees, the local authorities admit a conspiracy in which all were complicit. \"It was never meant to go this far. We vow our people shall never rob innocent travellers again!\" Proud to have effected change, you take back your possessions and leave.","801038":"<b>The enemy force is vast.</b> \"There's too many, Captain! We must turn back!\" But it is too late. The western cliff lights up with cannon fire, and your ship follows suit. Many lives will be lost before you finally crawl out of range.   ","801039":"Make peace, and reason with the officials","801040":"<b>Despite your earlier aggression, they are willing to listen.</b> After an exasperating few days, you are finally able to prove your losses. The authorities take in any dockers who are found to be guilty, and most, if not all of your possessions are returned.  ","801041":"<b>The authorities stand with their own.</b> Following a ceasefire, you make your case as best you can, but it's not enough. Furthermore, you must answer for the damage you've caused. Unfortunately, this will mean leaving some of your best sailors behind to help with repairs. ","801042":"<b>You rumble the schemers!</b> The crew set aside superstition, and paint the ship with a different name. The most cut-throat of your sailors pose as wealthy officers, cabin curtains for sashes, so as to appear perfect victims. Taken in by it all, the innkeeper and his dockside associates are caught in the act. You make sure to relieve them of far more than they stole.","801043":"<b>The disguises are unconvincing.</b> A lick of paint, and the ship differs enough to blend in at the busy port, but moustaches and a change of clothes aren't enough for the sly innkeeper. \"Thought you could fool us?\" he scoffs.","801044":"<b>Your disguises are comically poor</b>, and yet the innkeeper is the picture of cordiality as he ushers your men to retake their seats. Your men exchange hopeful looks, but the other patrons start laughing. Almost in unison, they draw their pistols. \"What were we thinking?\" mutter your men. \"I wonder where you'll end up!\" the innkeeper cackles, as he has your crew stripped, bound, and pushed off to sea.","801045":"Take back what is yours by force","801046":"Threaten to expose their scheme","801047":"<b>Sometimes a fistfight is the only way.</b> The inn is a hurricane of chairs and glass, as your crew express themselves the only way they know how. Once the locals are subdued, the innkeeper is dragged outside, his life used as a security against whatever plunder you please. ","801048":"<b>The locals are brutal.</b> Home-made knuckles, knives and cudgels scrape open the faces of your crew. Some are left to bleed out on the sticky hostelry floor, while the bloody remainder are packed off by the authorities for disturbance of the peace. Eventually they will be released, leaving you lighter on both goods and personnel. ","801049":"<b>The innkeeper agrees to negotiate.</b> \"We've got a good thing going here, and I don't want you spoiling it,\" he sniffs, \"take what's yours and leave.\" Glad to avoid further trouble, your crew recover their possessions and leave. One can but feel sorry for the next poor victims of this villainous scheme.  ","801050":"<b>\"Get out, before we scratch you out!\"</b> growls the innkeeper, his true colours plain to see. It seems every surly thug in the port is on his side. The expedition must take this loss of time and equipment on the chin. ","801051":"<b>You make the case well.</b> \"You are quite right. Terrible corruption such as this must be put to an end!\" says the governor, \"And of course, you shall have back what was taken.\" His disingenuousness stinks to high heaven, but you don't have time to go digging any deeper.","801052":"<b>They are completely corrupt.</b> \"What an extraordinary tale! I am so glad our little country has fired your imagination!\" smiles the governor.","801053":"Risk implicating the governor","801054":"Resort to violence","801055":"<b>\"Clever. Very clever,\"</b> admits the medal-draped governor, as he puffs solemnly on his cigar. \"How did you know the innkeeper was my brother?\" Your emissary doesn't let slip it was pure guesswork. \"Go ahead, take whatever you want,\" he gestures to a warehouse bursting with confiscated goods, \"so long as you keep quiet about all this— can't have my superiors finding out.\" ","801056":"<b>\"A grave last mistake,\"</b> chuckles the governor, as the poplar-lined grounds of his palace swarm with militia, \"arrest these fops!\" Your delegation try to resist, but are armed only with the toothpicks that came with their canapes. Your expedition must now manage without them.","801057":"<b>\"Alright, alright!\"</b> says the amused governor, bayonet to his neck, \"take back what you lost. But then you leave.\" Since the harbour is now so well-guarded, it feels rather an achievement to have forced any sort of compromise. ","801058":"<b>'That was a mistake,'</b> chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest them!' Your crew would rather die than be locked-up for life, so they fight their way out. At least, one or two of them do.","801059":"Give up and leave","801060":"<b>There's widespread frustration among the crew.</b> \"Those instruments were vital for my research!\", \"You let the beggars off scot free?!\", \"This expedition is an embarrassment!\" It's hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.","801061":"<b>There's widespread frustration among the crew.</b> \"Those instruments were vital for my research!\", \"You let the beggars off scot free?!\", \"This expedition is an embarrassment!\" It's hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.","801063":"The Arid Basin","801064":"<b>Water has dribbled almost to nothing during an inland survey</b>, en route to the rendezvous. But hope springs eternal! A muddy river strikes through the arid basin. The crew are delirious when they realise it is not completely dried-up. Do you stop for water, or press on?","801065":"Trust the botanist's expertise","801066":"Fashion a device to extract water from mud","801067":"Look for the source of the river","801068":"Press on to the rendezvous","801069":"<b>The botanist foams at the mouth with thirst-quenching theories.</b> 'The best idea may be these trees. Cut them just here, and catch the drip of water beneath,' they say, as they take a knife to the bark. Before an hour has passed, there's enough water to soothe a beached humpback.","801070":"<b>'The secret is boiling the water'</b>, says one resourceful survivalist, 'and needless to say a mixture of charcoal, sand and cloth makes a fine filter.' With water drawn, filtered and boiled, the crew can be sure it is safe to drink. Time even for a mud bath - your safari brigade slopping about like happy hippo.","801071":"<b>The water still has a mighty pong</b>, despite all solids having been separated out by the rudimentary device. Several feel terribly ill after drinking. A treatment can be improvised, or the survey can try to hold out until the rendezvous.","801072":"<b>Hours under hot sun, for fatally little.</b> Countless designs in the soil, and no prototype. When something is finally cobbled together, the fools test their stupid sieve with the last of the clean supply. It will be a miracle now if anyone survives.","801073":"<b>Finding a river source is easy</b>, but turning it into a shortcut...? That takes brains. High above the dry basin, water piles blissfully into the gully. The men wouldn't miss a swim beneath a waterfall for the world!","801074":"<b>There's water, if you can get to it.</b> Hippos are gathered all along the bank. This is their territory. If you don't refill here, there's no guarantee you'll find water further on.","801075":"<b>Following a river should have been easy.</b> But your party are so focused on distant goals, they fail to look immediately ahead. Suddenly, a man shoots downward as if yanked by giant hands. There are holes everywhere - an underground system of caves, and a tomb for your unlucky crew.","801076":"<b>There was never enough water for all of them.</b> A freak mist has the crew licking air with cracked tongues, but nothing can keep the wolf from the door. Several drop dead as old bone, before the safari staggers to the rendezvous camp.","801077":"Improvise a treatment","801078":"Hurry to the rendezvous","801079":"<b>The sickness clears over time.</b> 'With dysentery the patient must rest,' the sensible doctor said, 'away from the others.' With the last of the good water, and gentle nursing, the caravan reaches the rendezvous in fair health.","801080":"<b>No-one is ready for dysentery.</b> The sick are empty and weak, no fluids to replenish all they have lost. With only vague measures in place to prevent the spread, savannah delirium reigns. The survey never reaches the rendezvous.","801081":"<b>Haste saves some, but not all.</b> Dysentery is thoroughly set in by the time the survey makes the rendezvous. Although the camp provides the sick every comfort, for many the rigours of the sickness prove too much.","801082":"Scare the hippos away","801083":"Approach the water cautiously","801084":"Shoot at the hippos","801085":"Wait for nightfall, hoping they leave","801087":"<b>Hip hip hooray!</b> The hippos run as fast as their stout legs will carry them. The serenity of the river bank is utterly destroyed, but none of your crew care, as they help themselves to bucketfuls of clean and highly quaffable drinking water.","801088":"<b>Someone knows their hippopotami.</b> A kinship with the animals allows the gentle river bank to be shared. Fresh water is relayed by the bucket. A few nervous moments as a large female rears out of the water, but she just wants a bird to pick her teeth. Satisfied, the crew resume their trek to the rendezvous.","801089":"<b>There's movement in the hippo camp</b>, as the crew approach, followed by violent evacuations of their gigantic nostrils. Mandolin jaws open wide in display, and it is pretty clear to the crew they have no choice but to back off.","801090":"<b>A game of unhappy hippos ensues!</b> The water swirls with their pudgy bodies. They snort and scream, and prepare to charge.","801091":"Fire at the charging hippo","801092":"Immediately run away and leave the area entirely","801093":"<b>Cold, but effective.</b> The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead. The other hippos falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink.","801094":"<b>The hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.</b> One is dead on impact. Others die slow, trampled or drowning, matchstick guns floating downriver like poohsticks. There's almost no-one left to make the rendezvous.","801095":"<b>The escape is more panic than anything else</b> - the crew are spooked! Lurching through the water with a herd of hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again. You will have to try something else...","801096":"<b>Aquatic combat is a key discipline.</b> What small guilt the crew feel about driving the poor hippos from their patch is overcome by a will to survive. Out here, it is such ruthlessness that separates the living from the dead.","801097":"<b>What shot hits, barely passes through blubber.</b> The whole bloat of hippos charge, leaving them an instant to make a decision.","801098":"Fire at the hippos","801099":"Run","801100":"<b>Cold, but effective.</b> The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead. The other hippo falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink.","801101":"<b>The hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.</b> One is dead on impact.

Lurching through the water with a herd of hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again. You will have to try something else...","801103":"<b>Hardly seems worth waiting for.</b> The hippos wallow all evening, leaving only as night falls to graze. The crew have lost half a day's march on the rendezvous, for a bit of muddy water.","801104":"<b>A waste of time.</b> The hippos leave at dusk to graze. Unfortunately, their patch is just a stone's throw away. Their aqueous eyes can be seen glistening in the moonlight, and no-one wants to risk it.","801580":"You have found a radiant relic! The crew toast the success of your archaeological expedition. May we now better understand what it is to be human!","801587":"Sunken Depths","801588":"<b>Unusual debris floats among the waves.</b> Mold-ridden planks of wood, strings of cloth, fragments of broken plaster, all tinted by the grey shade of time. Filled with childish excitation, the crew discusses the possibility of going underwater to uncover the debris' origin.","801589":"Send your diver into the depths","801590":"Improvise a diving bell","801591":"Ignore the beckoning junk","801592":"<b>The diver plunges into the ocean with fish-like ease.</b> He follows the trail of debris through the murky waters and almost smacks into a wall of indescribable height. Unsure whether the obstacle is natural or man-made, the diver wanders along its smooth facade until he finds an uncanny artefact and resurfaces with it. His account of the underwater mystery fascinates the crew.","801593":"<b>The diving bell looks decent and feels solid.</b> Two men climb aboard and the bell plunges into the depths while a whole group of sailors pumps air into its ventilation tube. The bell descends until it is stopped by a surface of coral. Underneath the colorful shapes, the sailors notice a silver coin on their left and a gaping, perfectly circular hole on their right.","801594":"<b>The homemade diving bell falls apart.</b> The engineers, specialized in complex ship machinery, have no idea how to make such a simple device. Their machine departs with two men onboard, and they continue to dive while the bell itself stays afloat. When the divers emerge, the engineers take an earful, and the crew are too disheartened to make a new attempt.","801595":"Hope that it will resist the dive and push the bell into the hole","801596":"Pick up the coin and resurface","801597":"<b>Their trust in the work of their comrades pays.</b> The bell slithers in a slow fall which allows the bewitched divers to take in the view. This is no sunken ship: the engraved hole was a window among a hundred more lining a hall of ridiculous proportions. A single ray of light, pouring from the hole, accompanies the bell's descent until it lands on what might have been statue alcoves. A shining green pearl lies in the lowest part of the alcove.","801598":"<b>The bell doesn't resist the fall.</b> Instead of gliding along the sides of the hole, the bell tilts, letting the water in. The men call for help and the crew immediately tries to pull them up, fighting against what rocks snare the bell, doing their best to save their mates, and unable to react when the rope snaps into their hands. They are left to mourn their sea-buried companions.","801599":"Ignore the pearl and risk the dive into darkness","801600":"Retrieve the pearl from the dead-end and resurface","801601":"<b>Call it luck or miracle, but the bell holds.</b> One of the men lights the bell's lamp and the other dives, following the glow as it illuminates the silent scene below: ghostly statues of hunting scenes, collapsed frescoes depicting plentiful gardens, and a massive throne of fractured marble on which a sword waits, covered in fluttering kelp. When the artifact is brought back to the surface and cleaned up, it reveals a weapon of exquisite quality, embedded with unknown jewels and metals.","801602":"<b>Lady Luck does not smile for the faithless.</b> As the bell descends into the dark, so does the pressure rise and press against the makeshift protection. The sailors pull the signal rope in a panic, but despite their fervent prayers, they are not pulled up in time. All that the crew manages to retrieve from the sea are the broken bell and its broken contents.","801603":"<b>The pearl is made of pure jade!</b> The crew marvels at it and all want to touch it, feel it, smell it. The pearl spreads a nostalgic fragrance of salt water, fresh moss and damp stones, and the sailors agree this might be the very smell of adventure.","801604":"<b>Low risk, low reward.</b> The diving bell emerges without a scratch and the crew enjoys the tiny silver coin, passing it around and commenting on its singular aspect. Their excitement can only survive for so long and the coin is stored in the officers' coffers while the sailors whisper what ifs leading to grander treasures.","801605":"<b>The sailors protest but understand the risk.</b> As the ship goes on its way, its wake drowns the singular ruins and their promise of adventure.","801607":"The Trial","801609":"<b>The crew face the bloody customs of foreign lands.</b> After a night of feasting, the sailors believe that meeting the foreign prince and his sea-travelling court is the highlight of their trip. However, morning comes with news of a sudden death among the court, as your crew find themselves immediately accused of murder. The prince demands a trial by combat, and your men are left with little freedom but the choice of the challenge's nature.","801610":"Send your strongest fighter for a brawl","801611":"Send your best shot for a pistol duel","801612":"Send your brightest officer for a trial of wits","801613":"<b>What could a lord do against a sea-forged champion?</b> The prince's warrior is nothing more than a scarecrow in shiny armor, and your own cotton-clad fighter scoffs at his tacky opponent. The walking wardrobe is tripped, grabbed, and thrown overboard in a single movement. As per foreign laws, your crew receives compensation and their name is cleared.","801614":"<b>No word is brutal enough to describe your opponent.</b> If his plate armor is scaled to match the man inside, then that man is a giant. The human mountain reaches to grab your fighter and crushes his skull like he would an apple. Word of your crew's feebleness and alleged crimes is sent for all cities to know and spread.","801615":"<b>Your gunslinger shoots faster than his own shadow.</b> His opponent drops to the ground before anyone can see or even understand that a gun has been fired, and only the banging sound and fuming barrel testify to the attack. The prince wonders how lucky your sharpshooter is, then reluctantly graces the crew and presents them with compensation for his offence.","801616":"<b>Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.</b> The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen. Your best shot is dead before he even touches the handle of his gun. Judging his passing to be too low a price, the prince randomly selects men among your crew and has them hanged for good measure.","801617":"<b>The foreigners are drawn in by your officer's pace.</b> He inspects the body, noticing knife cuts of varying depths and bleeding. Through methodical questioning, the officer presses the foreigners and reveals the deception: each wound was made by a different hand, the victim was killed by all of them! The prince buys the sailors' silence and they leave wondering what could have motivated the curious murder.","801618":"<b>A mute would have pleaded better.</b> The officer engages in a battle of arguments with the prince's vizier, and each of his meager claims are met with factual evidence of their contrary. The prince cuts the exchange with exasperation and has the officer taken to be quartered till torn apart as a final judgement for the supposed crime. No scream ever matches the ones heard that day.","801620":"Iceberg","801621":"<b>Your ship is stranded on an iceberg!</b> It is night. The meek light of your vessel seems to dissolve into the moonless blackness. Even at easy sail and under constant vigil, your ship is running the risk in these waters, for slumbering ice giants lurk in the darkness in all directions. \"Dead ahead!\" comes the cry, but it's too late. A low growl shakes the boat, as a wave dumps it atop an iceberg, which is shaped like an upturned molar. The ship is undamaged, but beached — if only it could be returned to the water...","801622":"Break free with dynamite","801623":"Bombard the icy prison","801624":"Build something to help you escape","801625":"Pray for divine intervention","801626":"<b>Nothing in nature can prevail against human endeavour,</b> it would seem. The crew watch with trepidation as the fuses burn down to the stick, before an ear-splitting series of detonations ring across the vastness, sundering the icy claws that had held your ship hostage. A small blizzard of debris blankets the deck, to the hilarity of all on board, for they are free once more!","801627":"<b>Ice crumbles all around courtesy of some impressive firepower.</b> Any cannon that can be swiveled at the target is put to use, chipping away at the icy dungeon in which the ship has become wedged until the way is clear. Then, like a cheerful sea lion, the fair vessel slips down an escarpment and plops back into the water. The crew cheer.","801628":"<b>The iceberg fights back.</b> Though the way is almost clear, the relentless cannon fire seems to have woken the ogre below — and to the horror of the crew, the vast berg rolls slightly to one side. Great shards of ice detach and bounce over the deck, injuring your men. Quick action is needed.","801629":"Get out and push the ship free","801630":"Let the rolling iceberg toss you into the sea","801631":"<b>Your men live for such challenges,</b> and scarcely need telling what to do. Leaping down from the boat, they get behind her, knotting guy ropes as fast as they can. As they work, the berg rumbles suggestively, but it is your quick-thinking crew who prevail. Once clear of the ice field, the crew will be able to treat their wounds.","801632":"<b>It's an uphill struggle.</b> The pitching of the unstable berg does not help one jot, as the men tumble and slide to find grip. Such is the effort required to pull the ship successfully down from the iceberg into the sea, that no-one notices one of the teams is missing. It appears they have fallen through a thin part of the ice to their deaths...","801633":"<b>Your ship performs a rather messy dismount.</b> After that initial roll, the iceberg halts long enough to suggest it wants to stay in its new position — but then everything happens all at once. The berg spins violently, and the ship goes with it! The ship strikes the water at such an angle that very serious damage is done to much of the lee-side. Fortunately, the crew emerge unharmed.","801634":"<b>The crew assemble a dozen hardy levers to free the ship.</b> Flexible hickory planking is cut and reshaped into wedges, before being inserted into the ice at intervals of five paces, until they surround the stern. On a count of three the men lift, and to their surprise, so does the hull! Once it starts moving, there's no stopping it, and it clatters through the icy obstructions to the sea. Your sailors embrace in the wake of their success — they have been very resourceful.  ","801635":"<b>The crew choose the wrong wood for the task.</b> They select a decorative mahogany veneer, stripped from the captain's cabin. \"Whatever it takes,\" the captain says with laudable magnanimity, but the whole business is futile. Despite the wedges being placed in great number at the stern of the ship, no amount of pressure from the crew can encourage the ship to move, since the levers lack the requisite spring. They'll need to find another way off this iceberg. ","801636":"<b>The crew realise they are blessed!</b> \"If God has seen fit to place us here, we should trust in him,\" says the ship's holy man, thoughtfully, \"I would not discount the idea that this very iceberg has sentience! I know of at least one explorer whose expeditions ride bergs by design!\" Indeed, the navigators observe that the iceberg is itself moving, and at fair speed, in a desirable direction. This shall make a fine home for a time.","801637":"<b>The days melt into weeks that melt into months.</b> Even the probable agnostics among the crew take to prayer, for each passing day there is some fresh cause for optimism, some sign that someone is listening. As spring approaches, some of the berg thaws. One day, a migratory bird is spotted. At long, long last, a vast chunk of the iceberg separates, leaving the ship mere metres from open water. A day of heaving has it afloat again, though your men have lost all notion of time.","801638":"<b>There is no-one out there.</b> After a week perched atop the pink-white berg, with supplies diminishing, the crew cannot bear to wait in the gnawing cold any longer. Any help will have to come from within.","801642":"Scylla and Charybdis","801643":"<b>Your crew attempts the crossing of a vicious strait.</b> Like Odysseus along the coasts of Sicily, they see a subsidiary current running counter to the main flow, its strength so wild it brings fish with deformed eyes and luminescent bellies to the surface. What creatures are not swallowed by this whirlpool end up impaled on the shore's nasty teeth.","801646":"Avoid the whirlpool and maneuver to dodge the shore","801647":"Avoid the shore and hope the whirlpool won't suck the ship in","801648":"<b>Odysseus didn't have the ability of your navigators.</b> Through a series of tight maneuvers and expert understanding of the furious currents, they drive the ship between the whirlpool and the shore, using the provided momentum to dash ahead. The moment is as brief as it is intense, and the crew rejoice, laughing like children under the cold droplets of crashing waves.","801649":"<b>The maneuver is even more complicated than expected.</b> The ship is driven alongside the whirlpool and flirts with the shore, the racket of the water covering the orders shouted by officers. The current speeds up, inexorably pulling the ship towards the reef.","801650":"<b>Fear clouds the navigators' readings.</b> Unable to choose between several possible courses which could all end in disaster, they opt for a stunned silence and let the crew maneuver on their own. The ship crashes on the shore in an explosion of metal and wood which sends a dozen men overboard and straight into the rock fangs of the coast. It is more a wreck than a ship which escapes the deadly strait.","801651":"Spin the ship to take the damage on its flank","801652":"Bombard the shore in an attempt to slow the ship","801653":"<b>A frontal crash is avoided, but it is a crash nonetheless.</b> The whole ship protests against the unnatural movement, its rudder straining against the current and its hull complaining loudly against the maneuver until the impact silences it. The repairs are much lighter than they could have been.","801654":"<b>Your navigators cannot control the wild ship.</b> The maneuver sends it spinning and it plunges into the reef prow first. If it weren't for the metal cast protecting the vessel, the crew would have been crushed as well. The repairs, which take place both in the swirling waters and on the knife-like rocks, are excruciating.","801655":"<b>Power faces power in a risky but successful attempt.</b> All cannons are fired in the shore's direction, in a surprisingly efficient effort to slow the ship down. The ship lands on the devastated coast and the hull is barely grated by the remains of the broken stone spears.","801656":"<b>What did they expect, attacking nature itself?</b> The massive teeth of stone barely tremble under the cannon's fire, and the recoil is a futile strength against the voracious current. The rock jaw catches the ship and grinds the upper deck, sending several sailors to be served as the strait's daily food.","801657":"<b>The sailors' fright gives them wings.</b> The crew reacts to each order with unparalleled speed, too occupied to plead the heavens to think of discussing the risky manoeuvres that are asked of them. When at last the whirlpool is passed, their belief that the Almighty might have his eyes on this ship is stronger than ever.","801658":"<b>There are only so many disasters faith can prevent.</b> When they understand that the whirlpool is a monster none should face, the sailors fall to their knees to pray and beg, abandoning what meaningless impact they could have had on the ship's trajectory.

Either way, it allows the Pyrphorians to turn and catch a strong westerly squall. They are halfway to the bay of Montoya before your sailors can reposition. You'll have to rely on picking up their trail when you get there.","801687":"Train your main guns on their cannons","801688":"<b>Destructive, but effective.</b> A shot explodes onto the Pyrphorian deck, and the weighty flame cannons drop through the boards.

They arrive to find the Casona looks quite modern, with white walls and pleasant gables. <b>The Prosperity contract must be here.</b> An adjoining orangery extends naturally towards the neat parterres of a sweet-smelling garden. An arc of white gravel serves as a drive, with long lines of equally white picket fence bordering the acreage in typical colonial style. Indeed, were it not for the unusual height of this perimeter, and the shelters abutting it at regular intervals — armed guards no doubt stationed in each — it would appear much as any other estate. You consider your plan of entry.","801998":"Bribe","802000":"A Crack in the Hull","802002":"<b>Water in the hull!</b> The overloaded ship could only go so far with this many supplies in its belly. A series of strong waves sends the crates flying, and the boat's stomach soon explodes. Cracks pierce the hull where the cargo hit, and trickles of water pop one after the other throughout the storage space.","802003":"Use the electric water pump to allow proper repairs","802004":"Improvise a water pump to allow immediate repairs","802005":"Seal the damaged section and repair it at the next harbour","802006":"<b>Specific situations call for specific solutions: your preparation was on point.</b> The electric pump roars and swallows water much faster that it can infiltrate the ship, allowing the sailors to repair the damage with ease.","802007":"<b>Your crafty crew has a solution for everything.</b> Using communication tubes as the pump's body, and spare metal sheets as paddles, the sailors manage to assemble what could pass for a proper water pump. It takes a good dozen men to make it work, but they buy enough time for proper repairs.","802008":"<b>This joke of a pump looks like it came from the Dark Ages.</b> As the sailors battle to have their own idea of a pump prevail over the others, they assemble a monster that does nothing more than blow bubbles. One of the cracks in the hull bursts in a spray of water, silencing the machine as the ship starts to flood.","802010":"Seal the overflowing section, regardless of what - or who - might still be inside","802011":"Make a decision! Who knows what'll happen if you don't!","802012":"<b>The ship rises in the water, but at what cost?</b> The sailors watch their supplies drift away from the vessel, their hearts lingering after the lost items, until the officers remind them of the urgency of the repairs.","802013":"<b>There's nothing more to be done.</b> The ship slowly sinks, pulled deeper into the water with each new fracture in its hull. Both cargo and crew are drenched by the leaks, and the ship vomits their remains when it crashes onto the shore. The survivors contemplate the wreckage in despair, before trying to make repairs.","802014":"<b>Both cargo and crew are doomed to drown in the leakage.</b> The sailors close the hull's doors on their comrades, hushing their screams. However, there's no avoiding reopening the hull when time comes for repairs: the water flows out, carrying bodies transfixed with expressions of suffocation, terror, and betrayal.","802015":"<b>The drowned cargo cannot be salvaged.</b> When the ship finally finds a harbour, its hull sits so far below the waterline your crew fears the boat will sink. Although such fears are unfounded, the leaks ruined a good part of your stored food, and the repairs feel like they should have be done much earlier.","802016":"Throw supplies overboard to try and lift the crack above the waterline","802017":"Okay","802018":"Cancel","802020":"Tavern Troubles","802021":"<b>These hoodlums are asking for it.</b> To each harbour its own ill-famed tavern, and this one is no exception. While your crew enjoys a beer at the counter, the tavern's door slams open, the bartender stiffens and the volume of conversations dwindles: the newcomers are regulars of the bad kind. One of the scruffy men elbows your doctor and gasps as the alcohol splashes on his unkempt clothes. He immediately grabs your sailor by the collar, and demands an apology.","802022":"They want to fight? Let them come!","802023":"Offer them a drink to ease the tension","802024":"This is a waste of time - simply apologise","802025":"<b>Your crew crushes them.</b> The collar-grabbed doctor slaps away the hand of the hoodlum, seizes his sleeve and pulls him over his shoulder, sending him crashing into a table. With a roar, the other thugs pounce on your sailors, who greet them with jabs to the chin and sternum, downing the attackers with no more than two hits per man - the seconds for the pleasure of good fighting form. The tavern applauds the action, and the bartender offers a round to celebrate a well deserved beating.","802026":"<b>The crew overestimated themselves.</b> As he calls for the other sailors to help, the doctor gets his head smashed into the counter. His crewmates scream for revenge, and look like toddlers agitating their little arms to try and hit the big bad guys. The thugs are not in the mood to play along, and one of them stabs a bawling sailor in the liver to make them shut up. They slowly die as the thugs depart, leaving the tavern in a stupor.","802027":"<b>The language of alcohol is universal.</b> The thugs take you up on your offer, and eye the sailors' purses as they pass the money around to pay for the beers. As the first round arrives, one of the hoodlums speaks up and announces that they will have a drinking contest with the crew. The idea is one-sided, and weirdly different from their previous aggressive attitude.","802028":"<b>Bribing them with alcohol doesn't seem to work.</b> Your crew invites the men to sit and share a beer, on them, to try and bring the tension down. The thug doesn't let go of the doctor, and points at the aligned liquors behind the bartender. A glass of all of these, he says, and a bottle of your best whatever. That's way more than they can drink - and way more than your sailors can afford.","802029":"Show them the drinking ability of seafarers","802030":"Drug their drinks to avoid the confrontation","802031":"<b>They call that cat piss strong?</b> There's no question regarding who wins the drinking contest: your crew are still standing and enjoying the beers long after the thugs have hit the ground, curled into whatever their stomach rejected. The pungent smell of vomit and cheap ale does not deter the sailors, who casually finish their steins, pay for them, and drag the hoodlums to the closest man of law.","802032":"<b>What kind of liquid fire do they make this with?</b> The crew are used to strong drinks and exotic ales, but the tavern's special mixture of bourbon, sugar and Ricard is way past what they can handle. The thugs are accustomed to this local horror and barely wobble, while your sailors pass out one after the other. When they wake up, obviously, their purses are missing.","802033":"<b>War anaesthetics are remarkably useful against small-time thugs.</b> After a few rounds spent boasting their virile resistance to any kind of liquor, the crew notice the drop in attention of their opponents, and their doctor seizes the opportunity, lacing the incoming mugs with just the right dosage of chloroform. The snoring hoodlums are delivered to the local authorities, who enjoy the unexpected present.","802034":"<b>The dosage doesn't put the thugs to sleep: it kills them.</b> The doctor sidles among the thugs, lacing their drinks and snickering in expectation. Soon the effects appear: the gang shows drowsiness, then nausea, before losing control of their movements and tumbling against the counter, their faces taking on a waxy yellow color. The crew can do nothing as the hoodlums break into seizures and foam at the mouth. They win the drinking contest by default, as murderers of their opponents.","802035":"If it's a fight they want, they'll get one","802036":"Pay up","802037":"<b>The crew are humiliated.</b> They empty their purses trying to pay for the excessive demands of the thugs. Ale. Stew. Liquors. Meats. When sunrise pushes the hoodlums to leave the tavern, the sailors are stuck with cooking, dishwashing and dust-wiping until the bartender considers their debt paid.","802038":"<b>Your sailors apologise through gritted teeth.</b> Pleased by their groveling, the thugs don't pester them anymore, yet the heavy stares of the other clients push your crew to leave the tavern. Next time, they'll show them. Next time.","802040":"Mutiny!","802041":"<b>Clear skies, calm seas, and mutiny!</b> The tension has been building. The everyday strains of an expedition — the rationing of supplies, a lack of recognition from the officers — it has all become too much for the lower-ranks to take.

The officers address each of the criticisms of the running of the ship, agreeing where possible to make adjustments — and where they find it's not possible, they take the time to explain exactly why things must stay the way they are. Everyone seems most satisfied with such a fair and democratic resolution.","802047":"<b>The threat of mutiny is gone, for now.</b> The negotiations begin well, but ultimately remain unresolved, with the first mate too stubborn to make compromises for his inferiors, and the mutineers seemingly unable to see the bigger picture.

He is a force of nature, too incendiary for any of your officers to handle. With each new compromise offered by your representative, he makes further, more unreasonable demands. Something must be done, and fast.","802053":"<b>Your representative is utterly tactless.</b> It is late, he has had too much gin, and he barges into the sailors' quarters barking insults and commands. The crew toss aside their paperbacks and swing down from their hammocks, laying into him with their fists. Perhaps they don't intend to kill him, but nevertheless, that's what they achieve. To settle the matter, the captain agrees to keep their crime a secret, so long as there's no more talk of mutiny.","802054":"Quietly poison him","802055":"Have him arrested","802056":"Ignore him","802057":"<b>The doctor agrees to be an accomplice,</b> and his complicity proves vital. Dispensing with his moral objections, your medic produces a poison that causes rapid respiratory failure. A man known to be loyal to the captain secretly administers it, and within a few days the chief firebrand of the mutineers is dead. \"Cancer of the lung,\" says the doctor, \"most probably caused by stress.\" No-one suspects a thing, but the officers must keep a terrible secret.","802058":"<b>It is obvious you tried to poison him.</b> The doctor refuses to help, objecting, \"It's despicable — and besides, I know nothing of poisons.\" Instead, you're forced to rely on the help of the ship's cook. The \"wine\" he concocts is discoloured, and obviously reeks of death, but the poor fellow is too drunk to notice. Unfortunately for you, the doctor chooses to issue an emetic, and saves the firebrand from his untimely demise. \"The bastards tried to kill him!\" scream the mutineers, as <b>they converge upon the captain's cabin.</b>","802059":"In a final attempt to keep order, offer a bribe","802060":"Fight them: officers vs. sailors","802061":"This will be costly.","802062":"Okay","802063":"Cancel","802064":"<b>They take the bribe, but their loyalty cannot be bought.</b> The trust between the commanding officers and the crew has been shattered. Since there appears no single culprit, it is agreed that all senior officers be put on probation so that any member of the crew may hold them to account for their actions henceforth. Needless to say, the general mood among the officers is low.","802065":"<b>Blood is the only payment they will take.</b> Weakened by the poisoned wine, the leader of the rebels appears on a crutch. His followers part in taciturn awe, as he hobbles forward. \"Name your scapegoat,\" he says. One of the junior officers draws the short straw. \"Cut out his eyes!\" And with two gruesome oyster scoops, the hierarchy aboard your ship is turned upside down. The captain has no choice now but to grant several of the rebels positions of authority aboard ship.","802066":"<b>It's a bloody end, but your officers can fight.</b> Their academy training stands them in good stead as the dissident rabble charges. The sailors, equipped with hooks, nailboards and anything else they can find, are no match for your sabre-slashing redcoats. Although the mutiny is over, and its leader, too ill to fight, is safely in the brig, it's unlikely all those radical ideas have simply died with those who had held them.","802067":"<b>The officers show themselves unworthy of power.</b> Without loyalty, pride, or even discipline, the redcoat defenders are broken by the rabid horde. The leader of the mutineers, still groggy, makes an example of one of the officers, forcing him to drink the same deadly wine he was given. The captain has no choice but to grant the rebels positions of authority aboard ship. It will be a rocky ride from hereon.","802068":"<b>The leader comes quietly,</b> perhaps because soldiers loyal to the expedition have knocked and asked politely — it's more dignified that way. He is on his own now. Guards are stationed all along the route to the brig, separating him from his followers. Without their leader to organise and motivate them, the threat of mutiny becomes little more than a grumble.","802069":"<b>The rebels are ready to die for their leader.</b> It could have been a quick and clean arrest, but the mutineers crowding around outside their leader's quarters don't seem afraid.

For a moment, the ropes tying it to the other masts hold it in place, but there's only so much weight they can take: they break with a snap, letting the mizzenmast plummet on the deck. A sailor now wails, his leg caught under a pole twice his size.","802085":"Cover the leg with a mix of soap and water, and pull it away","802086":"Cut the leg with a bone saw","802087":"Lift the mast with a makeshift lever","802088":"<b>The sailor is easily pulled from under the mast.</b> The foamy water allows the crushed leg to slither away from the debris, and the limb emerges covered in rainbow bubbles and bloody splinters. The man will live - and maybe, with a miracle or two, his leg will mend.","802089":"<b>An extreme but commendable choice.</b> The sailor is given rum to drink and a cloth to bite before he is held in place, and his leg bound with a tight tourniquet. The doctor's labour is gruesome, and the man can feel the grinding cuts as they tear through him, and he screams through the cloth as he howls and he roars - and yet the doctor stays composed and focused. When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels reassured that they are in capable hands.","802090":"<b>Butchery.</b> The doctor's hands tremble more than his victim does, and the saw draws zigzags through his patient's flesh, each cut unable to connect with the previous ones. The trapped sailor's screams become whimpers, then silence. The doctor has to be stopped before he can ruin any more of the unfortunate corpse, and his blood-clad figure sends a warning to whoever might need his help in future.","802091":"<b>The man is freed.</b> Using one of the partners broken by the mast, the crew fits sturdy pieces of timber between the deck and the fallen mast, adding plank after plank in the opening, before gradually raising the mast with ropes and pulleys tied to the mainmast. They manage to lift the mast long enough to free the sailor, and the doctor immediately tends to his crushed leg.","802092":"<b>The vague idea of a lever never becomes real.</b> The sailors try to lift the mizzenmast by rolling logs underneath, but the huge wooden pole is far too heavy for its rolling movements to be controlled. The mast lurches forward and rolls from the sailor's leg to his chest, pushing his insides out. The view stays with the sailors for days before they can finally reach a decent harbour, get rid of the broken mast, and clean up the grisly mess underneath.","802094":"Sea of Sargassum","802095":"<b>A ship in need of rescue!</b> The vast floating tapestries of algae in these windless waters have long been thought impassable. Just when you thought your own vessel had managed to avoid the yellow-orange plants, you see another ship stuck fast! They must also have seen you, as their alarm begins to sound. With no proper rescue equipment aboard, your own ship risks becoming entangled if you get too close. Should you try to help?","802096":"A steamship should have nothing to fear here","802097":"Harpoon them and tug them away","802098":"Don't risk it","802099":"<b>Your steamer glides effortlessly through.</b> The crew lean from the rails to peer at the sargassum colony, which is thick with sealife like crabs and tropical fish. The algae parts easily before your ship. The absence of wind presents no difficulty as it would for a sailboat, and indeed, as you tug them into open water, the crew of the ship in distress explain it was not the algae, but the calm that had stalled them. They are delighted to have been discovered, and several of them offer to join your expedition.","802100":"<b>A good shot, but there is too little wind to tug them clear.</b> Having signalled your intention, the gunner sends the harpoon crunching into the other ship's hull. A fine shot, considering it was at the limit of the harpoon's range. However, the calm prohibits them pulling the ship out of the brown mass of algae, so the crew consider their next steps. ","802101":"<b>Panicked sailors toss themselves into the algae,</b> as your stray harpoon crashes wildly through the lower deck, and seawater rushes in through the breach. She's going down! \"We brought them to this,\" yells one of your officers, \"we have a responsibility to do something!\"","802102":"Throw them a 'life-line'","802103":"Inspire them to traverse the rope","802104":"<b>The breeches buoy guarantees a safe rescue.</b> The crew transform a lifebuoy into a harness, and attach it to runners which allow it to zip between the two ships once the harpoon rope is drawn taut. The stranded sailors take it in turns to enjoy this rather daring form of escape. Having been lifted from the doldrums, they are keen to assist however they may for the remainder of the expedition.","802105":"<b>The breeches buoy shears off into the water</b> just as the first sailor climbs onto the contraption, leaving it dangling perilously from the rope between the two ships. Desperate for rescue, the crew of the stranded boat decide to swim for it instead.

They're going to be quite a burden on your expedition.","802106":" <b>A surge of belief animates the stranded sailors.</b> \"You are saved!\" cries your lookout, \"your ordeal is over!\" Under the encouragement of your lieutenants, the other crew grab the rope, and with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Your crew's goodwill has shone through, and the grateful survivors join your expedition without a second thought.","802107":"<b>They take no strength from your crew's silent prayer.</b> If only someone had offered a few more words of encouragement — anything positive at all. First to cross is an old man so thin, you could fold him up and tuck him in a drawer. Clutching the fibrous rope is challenge enough for his frail wrists, and after a brief struggle, he drops off. His crewmates jump in with him, and commence a desperate thrash through the brown sargassum. The few that make it to your ship will only be a burden on your expedition.","802108":"Send your best swimmers to the rescue","802109":"Leave them to their fate","802110":"<b>Your swimmers are strong and fit enough,</b> but the malnourished crew of the sinking ship need all the help they can get. The algae weighs like a lion's mane on your heroes, as they relay the castaways on-by-one. Once all are accounted for, they lie on the burning deck, panting. This whole episode has been exhausting.","802111":"<b>The rescue is a tragedy.</b> Your men paddle like puppies in the densely-packed sargassum — it's hard to understand quite how sailors could be so lacking in practice. Gasping, they reach desperately towards the castaways they should be rescuing, as if for support, only for the undertow of the sinking ship to pull them under. This was all your fault.","802112":"<b>\"We did what we could...\"</b> the lieutenant trails off, \"...and we couldn't do much!\" answers your steersman darkly. There is so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the sinking boat by. Hands reach desperately towards you, but the pull of their sinking ship soon drags them under the surface. It will take an awful lot to lift your crew out of the doldrums.","802113":"<b>\"Don't leave! We've been here for ten years!\"</b> Reads the message in semaphore. There's so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the stranded boat by. A drift of shame.

The lava responsible for the fertile ground creeps from the mouth of the waking volcano, and towards the jungle where a party of your men had erected camp for the night.","802117":"Go back to the ship despite the darkness.","802118":"Find shelter against the incoming lava","802119":"<b>The ship is quickly found.</b> The burning lights of the volcano illuminate the jungle, and a handful of seasoned explorers lead the rest of the sailors back to the ship, zigzagging between shadows and fleeing animals. The vessel departs as the island is engulfed by flames, a vision as terrible as it is magnificent.","802120":"<b>The sailors are swallowed by the jungle's maze.</b> Dense trees, moving shadows, screeching animals and the crew itself, whose silhouettes are deformed by the scorching heat - too many visions allow panic to spread among the men, who cannot recognise the path, and never make it back to the ship.","802121":"<b>Shelter!</b> The crew finds a decrepit stone chapel, the remains of a colonialist power, and deems it better refuge than their cloth-made tents. An officer estimates that the lava will be on them soon: there's no choice but to spend the night here.","802122":"<b>Your crew are lost and perplexed.</b> Even your most committed explorers cannot wrap their heads around the complexity of the jungle, which changes with every newly burnt tree. It seems that every path might end in lava-devoured dead ends.","802125":"Pray for the chapel to hold","802126":"Dig trenches in the holy ground","802127":"<b>The chapel miraculously stands its ground.</b> Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nestled on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes, they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.","802128":"<b>Their faith is nothing but hypocrisy in need.</b> The crew remembers old prayers from their worshipping days, but the years have eroded both their memory and their beliefs. They can only watch as the lava packs against the chapel's stained glass and breaks through. The spray of molten stone and broken glass scars all of them but kills none: a bite to remind them of their lack of dedication.","802129":"<b>The trenches are dug with military efficiency.</b> Despite the darkness and the imminent danger, the sailors manage to dig deep trenches in no time, and the pits redirect the lava as it flows down the hill. The sailors bunker down in the chapel as the lava runs around the outside, illuminating the stained glass, leaving them to rejoice in the warm comfort of their shelter.","802130":"<b>Too much pressure and too little grit.</b> The sailors can dig little more than scattered and knee-deep pits, which have a negligible impact on the lava's course. As the crew scurries inside the chapel, so to does the lava, its smoke burning throats and forever robbing the men of their voices.","802131":"Follow a random animal and trust its instincts","802132":"Pick a random path and trust your instincts","802133":"<b>The animals run to the beach, and your crew follows.</b> Tracking down the herd of shrill, squealing, screeching critters could be done with eyes closed, and the sailors are led to the shore where they had beached. The ship departs in a hurry, leaving the animals to die in the ruthless volcano fire.","802134":"<b>Your hunters find no pattern in the animals' frenzy.</b> The sailors run in a display of panic and poor judgment, mimicking the animals' desperate behavior. The crew still on the ship can only watch in horror as the island's greatest predator burns all its prey, be they beast or human.","802135":"<b>Fear is the most reliable instinct.</b> The sailors scamper through the jungle, chasing after their lava-lit shadows. They stumble upon the beach by pure miracle, and hop on the ship with molten tongues on their heels. The ship departs with a slightly charred hull, but a safe crew.","802136":"<b>Fear is a treacherous adviser.</b> Seeing that the only unburnt path is up, the sailors climb the jungle's trees in an attempt to escape the lava flow. Ground, then bark, then branches, then humans: everything burns. In the distance, the ship's remaining crew stay transfixed as they witness the volcano island devouring itself.","802138":"Selfless Deeds","802139":"<b>\"They steal your children?\"</b> The air hangs heavy around the sailors as their question withers in the hut. Their hosts consider the explorers, half-hopeful, half-guilty from the certitude that non-paying jobs are not the ones your crew enjoys. One child has to be offered with each new moon, an elder explains as she gestures towards the nearby river, or else bandits raid the surrounding settlements. Tomorrow, the bandits' steamboat will come to claim this village's due.","802140":"Board the bandits' steamer with your gunboat","802141":"Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff","802142":"Stay on your ship and open fire when the steamboat appears","802143":"Ignore the bandits and go on your way","802144":"<b>Your assault is swift, and without a single casualty.</b> The kidnappers offer no resistance, as their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout - a sweatshop with no employees other than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exultant parents. Though they can offer no reward but tears and smiles, your crew basks in the warmth of this priceless payment.","802145":"<b>Your crew navigates through the mangrove with aplomb.</b> The unusual environment doesn't manage to stop their steady rowing, and the sailors soon reach an outpost marking the entrance of the bandits' camp. Sobbing children are taken from the kidnappers' steamboat, and dragged towards a distant barn. Half a dozen armed men guard the building.","802146":"<b>The terrain is not one your crew are used to.</b> They get stuck in the mangrove roots, and their swearing can be heard all the way to the coast. When they manage to get free, the bandits' steamboat is waiting, its railings lined with guns.","802147":"<b>Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.</b> The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate, causing them to lose their quarry. Disturbingly, while trying to find their bearings, your crew ends up making a discovery more harrowing than they could ever imagine: a pit filled both with torn shoes, and their torn young makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.","802148":"Attack the bandits before they reach the barn","802149":"Hide amongst the trees and wait for nightfall","802150":"<b>The bandits don't know what hit them.</b> Using the element of surprise to their advantage, your sailors break into the camp and stifle the children's escorts before they can call for help. They hush the kids, and squat behind what few bushes offer protection, monitoring the other bandits. The attack wasn't noticed.","802151":"<b>The sailors are unfit for a swift assault.</b> Their unchoreographed clumsiness and dissonant roars drives their opponents back not because of their strength, but because of the unconventional display. After an instant of bafflement, the kidnappers shout for others to join them, and the whole gang soon surrounds your crew. They part to let their leader, a beast of a man, face the puny intruders.","802152":"Go all out on the bandits and save the remaining children","802153":"Acknowledge the danger, and leave with the children you've already saved","802154":"<b>The sailors and kids create a breathtaking chaos.</b> The crew shoots and skewers, while the children kick and bite their former oppressors, calling for others to do the same. A deluge of shrieking kids and young adults emerge from the barn and attack the guards, thrilled by your crew's display of strength. The band of unlikely fighters seize the bandits' steamboat, helping themselves to its supplies, before triumphantly returning to the coast.","802155":"<b>Audacity does not make up for their lack of numbers.</b> The crew manages to take down five guards before the noise attracts more armed bandits, and the sailors are driven back to their boat before they can liberate any more children. They flee to the village, and share what they've discovered with the villagers, glad to have freed some kids, but all too aware that many more remain captive.","802156":"<b>The decision to run is not a simple one.</b> The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be, and retreat to the village along with the few children they've saved. They share what they've discovered with the villagers - and maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, and more planning... things could be different. As the ship leaves, the crew focuses more on the good they did, rather than what they could have done.","802157":"Fight the brute","802158":"Run away","802159":"<b>Your sailors' cause fuels their victory.</b> Driven by their will to save the children, your sailors do not waver in front of the bandits' leader, all muscles and swords with rage in his eyes. It takes six fighters to face the man, piling up on him in a torrent of dust and groans until he finally stops rampaging. Disheartened by this defeat, and their leader's meaningless pride, the remaining kidnappers are brought to their knees, and the children are freed. The crew returns to the village triumphant!","802160":"<b>The mastodon tramples your sailors.</b> The rescuers lack resistance, and are wiped out by the bandits' leader, their corpses sent flying among the children who can do nothing but watch in horror. In an ultimate act of hatred, a young girl is sent back to her village to retell the carnage, and warn future intruders against trying to rescue the children again.","802161":"<b>No sailor is harmed, no child is saved.</b> The crew manage to run back to the village, avoiding the multiple gunshots fired by the kidnappers. That no sailor was wounded is a miracle, but it's hard to celebrate much when the rescue team failed to rescue a single child.","802162":"<b>The crew becomes one with the trees.</b> Unseen and unheard, the sailors bury themselves in the forest, and observe their future targets. An opportunity arises when a group of bandits leave their posts to bathe in the river: splashing and talking, they don't hear your men approach.","802163":"<b>The sailors are not attuned to the notion of stealth.</b> They argue about the best place to hide, and end up lining up behind what could be the thinnest trees in the entire forest, their bulging shapes attracting more than a little unwanted attention from the kidnappers. Their leader, more beast than man, advances to inspect the intruders, and laughs at the puny men.","802164":"Steal their clothes to disguise yourselves as bandits","802165":"Capture the men and use them as hostages","802166":"<b>Your sailors use their disguises to orchestrate the children's escape.</b> Dressed in bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn-turned-sweat-shop, where the children are forced to work. One by one, they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies. When the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunition. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.","802167":"<b>The poorly-disguised intruders are identified and given chase.</b> When asked by an actual bandit about their shift, one of your undercover sailors tries to answer: they fumble and bumble until the bandit grabs them and shouts, \"intruders!\". They make a run for it with the others, leaving both kidnappers and children behind.","802168":"<b>A flawless move, from start to finish.</b> After swiftly capturing the naked bandits, the sailors advance, only to discover the camp's true nature: a child-powered sweatshop. It's soon obvious that the bandits' leader is the only one who doesn't care for the hostages, and the man is forcibly exchanged by his crew in return for the promise that your sailors will never set foot in there again. The rescuers return to the village with children on their shoulders, a culprit to be judged, and goods to be shared.","802169":"<b>The naked men overpower your fighters.</b> The element of surprise fails to compensate for your crew's lack of strength, and they're easily repelled by the bathing bandits. Instead of killing them, the kidnappers order the sailors to strip, and send them on their way so everyone can see them for what they are - rescuers who were unable to rescue anyone, and who were humiliated in the process.","802170":"Face the brute","802172":"<b>The crew are puny indeed, and they are butchered.</b> The bandits' leader needs no help in fighting your rescuers, who spend more time trying to avoid being hit than actually fighting back. They flee the camp, scatter into the woods, and are hunted down like game. The few sailors who make it back to the coast are so disoriented, they can't even remember the location of the kidnappers' camp, making the deaths of their companions pointless.","802173":"Bluff and pretend backup is on its way","802174":"Attempt to buy the children","802175":"Let them be and leave","802176":"<b>Your bluff works!</b> The kidnappers have a heated discussion before handing over what few children they have onboard, unnerved by the menace your crew just invented. The sailors retreat to the village and return the children to their families, still amazed by their deception, but upset they could save so few.","802177":"<b>They do not buy your bluff.</b> Holding your crew at gunpoint, the bandits casually wait for the reinforcements to show up - but they never arrive. To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard, and cut his tongue before throwing it into your raft: a lesson to you liars. Your sailors withdraw to the village, regretting having only made things worse.","802178":"The kidnappers smirk.","802179":"Okay","802180":"Cancel","802181":"<b>A pricey but worthy trade.</b> Trying to hide their distaste for treating children like goods, your sailors bring the kids onboard. They are in a state of shock, but they look physically sound.","802183":"The children are safe with you, punish their abductors","802184":"The children will be safer with their parents, let the kidnappers leave","802186":"<b>Your retribution is ruthless.</b> The kidnappers are still counting up the goods you bought the children with when the crew attacks, and its assault is brutal. The steamboat is set aflame, and the bandits die by fire or bullet. The crew returns the kids to the safety of their homes, but the children now see them as no different from their captors: beasts, driven by violent instincts.","802187":"<b>Your sailors are overpowered.</b> The kidnappers have fought much harder battles against much lesser men, and your crew's attack is dismissed with scorn. The bandits could easily have retrieved the children, but their strange sense of honor makes them consider that goods bought are goods acquired. The crew are sent back to the village with the kids, both looking equally dishevelled and aghast.","802188":"<b>A pity to let the culprits escape so easily.</b> The sailors return the children to their respective families, but the kids' joy fails to hide how many more could have been saved given a little extra effort.","802189":"<b>You don't meet the bandits' expectations.</b> To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his thumb, tossing it into your raft: a lesson for the penniless. Your sailors withdraw to the village, regretting having only made things worse.","802190":"<b>There's only so much your sailors can do.</b> They back away under the menace of the bandits' guns, doing their best not to trigger an attack, and row back to the coast. The parents of the abducted children thank them for their effort, but their strangled hopes make their voices break. The sailors leave knowing they could have done better.","802191":"<b>A masterful shot!</b> Using one of your precious spiral-muzzled cannons, the crew fires a single shot which pierces straight through the steamboat's engines. The boat gradually stops puffing and drifts to your own ship, where sailors can pick off the bandits, and retrieve the three stolen children.","802192":"<b>Poor use of your firepower.</b> The sailors handling the cannons are just as important as the weapons themselves. As your crew aren't quite as well-oiled as the machinery, they fail to adjust the quantity of powder being used, firing the artillery to its maximum range without any kind of aiming. They might as well have lit signal fires. The bandits' boat makes a brutal turn and retreats into the bayou at full speed.","802193":"<b>Both bandits and captives are killed.</b> The villagers watch in horror as your ship fires its cannons at the small steamboat as soon as it is in sight, annihilating the frail vessel and all life onboard. Mothers and fathers rush to the water, screaming and crying as tiny bodies slowly emerge. If your crew had a greater control over themselves and the ship, maybe they wouldn't have had to bear the weight of these children's deaths.","802194":"Scare the kidnappers into revealing the position of their hideout","802196":"Enough risks for today: return the children and be on your way","802197":"<b>Your seafarers coerce the river-dwellers into speaking the truth.</b> There is a world of knowledge and pain into your men's eyes, and the bandits are overwhelmed before a single word is spoken. Their hideout is easy prey for your crew, which storms through the den and triumphantly returns the children to their parents, along with the bandits' possessions and supplies.","802198":"<b>The intention is there, but not the result.</b> The bandits recognize your sailors for what they are: sharp-shooters, but weaklings when it comes to close-range confrontation. The crew's threats mean nothing to them. Knowing that these men are the only ones who know where the rest of the children are being held, your crew hands them over to the villagers along with the kids they found, and leave with a feeling of defeat.","802199":"<b>Thoughts of the remaining captives follow your crew.</b> The villagers are thrilled to have the handful of children returned to them and profusely thank their saviors, making the crew's remorse all the worse. The sailors are happy for them, but they know they could have done more.","802200":"<b>Not all sailors share your lack of compassion.</b> Some men and women refuse to leave, and the officers have no choice but to let them do as they please lest they lose even more of the crew's trust. Many sailors argue that staying to help was the right choice, but the ship has already set sail when they voice their opinion.","802201":"Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff","802203":"The Amazons","802204":"<b>The splendid warriors are all women.</b> Exploring this deserted settlement — which appears to have been the scene of a revolt — seemed a good opportunity for some looting, but your crew aren't the only ones to have had the idea. As they pass the barricades of barrels, tables and chairs, they happen upon a group of warriors, with not a man among them. Indeed, the long-trousered women assume a defensive formation so fluently, it's possible they are more than human.","802205":"Let a woman do the talking","802206":"Present your peaceful intentions","802207":"Bow before the goddesses","802208":"<b>She fascinates the warriors,</b> almost as much as they fascinate her. \"Many stray into our territories, but rarely does a woman lead them,\" says the tallest of the goddesses. Neither she nor the others make any further mention of these territories, how far they span, or if their people dwell in towns and cities. Your crew are invited to share in what they have found, however. As the women lope into the trees, eyes ever watchful, you wonder how they will repurpose all they have harvested from these ruins. It is your belief they may have stumbled into this chaos, from a distant, more noble age.","802209":"<b>They too share a love of exploration and discovery!</b> Though they know nothing of your language, your envoy takes great pleasure in unravelling his sea chart. Curiosity soon loosens them from their formation, as they crowd around him, sitting on their shields to get a better view. He describes the ship in gestures, and when he gets to the sails, for some reason they fall about with laughter. One of them snatches the map, and makes a suggestion as to where you might think of going next. It could be a shortcut!","802210":"<b>The behaviour of your diplomat is disgusting.</b> Instead of trying to communicate your good intentions, the belching toad circles them, looking them up and down as if to appraise their value. When he places a greasy hand on one of the warrior's cheeks, another woman breaks from the pack and plants her lance in his thigh.","802211":"Respond to their violence in kind","802212":"Placate them with gifts","802213":"<b>Firing a few shots skyward is enough.</b> The warriors have only shields and jagged lances, coming as they do from some nobler age. Yet the way they fearfully scurry away suggests they are no strangers to firearms. It feels like a missed opportunity to have got to know them better. All that's left is to tend to the sorry diplomat, whose leg has a very severe bleed. ","802214":"<b>They are too fast.</b> The distance between your small scouting party and the warriors is made up in moments, as the lithe women dive and roll, and thrust their lances. All your men are killed. The warriors spare your women, however, giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   ","802215":"The warriors seem interested, but watchful","802216":"Confirm","802217":"Cancel","802218":"<b>Your exotic supplies intrigue the warriors.</b> Their curiosity overtakes their anger, and seeing how fascinated they are by the crew's maps, the sailors guess that the women might share in their taste for exploration. Sadly, it appears too late to earn the warriors' trust, and they depart looking cautiously over their shoulders. You must tend to the sorry diplomat before you leave, as the bleed from his leg looks severe.","802219":"<b>The warriors take great offence.</b> One of them spits on the jacket of an officer. He responds by moving to draw his weapon, but the women are too fast. The lithe warriors dive and roll, and thrust their lances. Every man in your small scouting party loses their lives. The women are spared, however; the warriors giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   ","802220":"<b>Your crew's deference pleases the warriors.</b> Surprised by the sailors' genuflection, the women giggle and lower their guard, lifting your explorers' chins with the tips of their lances. They may not speak your language, but their body language is unequivocal — they are fellow adventurers, and wish to celebrate your meeting. A huge bonfire is made from the wooden barricades, and all enjoy their boozy punch and haunches of venison — which the women insist on eating raw. The wild party lasts long into the night. ","802221":"<b>Not everyone in your party shows respect. </b> Some are snickering about something, and the warrior women presume it concerns them. They spit at the men, who reach hot-bloodedly for their weapons.","802222":"Challenge them to a fight","802223":"Accept humiliation and leave","802224":"<b>This pleases them,</b> since out of everything, they are always most fond of a good fight. Your men are honourable and choose to fight hand-to-hand. It is a noble and even contest, punctuated by the metallic rasp of sword and spear, ending in stalemate. Both combatants have suffered injuries, and the two sides part with greater respect for their foes. Still, their wounds will need looking after...","802225":"<b>They are too fast.</b> The distance between your small scouting party and the warriors is made up in moments, as the lithe women dive and roll, and thrust their lances.

The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   ","802226":"<b>The sailors, especially the men, feel humiliated.</b> \"Those warrior women were strident,\" says one, \"I had absolutely no idea how I should respond to such provocation. They wanted us to draw our swords, which of course would have been wholly inappropriate!\" The women, on the other hand, can't help but dream of escaping this suffocating ship, to take up a lance and shield of their own.","802228":"The Deeper You Go","802229":"<b>A boulder-blocked entrance and a booby-trapped corridor: typical Mesoan temple.</b> After a fall down a slide and a crash into uncharted caves, your team of explorers jokes about the situation in an attempt to forget its deathly aspect. They know what people say of Mesoan mazes: the deeper you go, the shinier it gets.","802230":"Follow the suggested route and progress through the traps","802231":"Create your own path and push the boulder away","802232":"<b>The obvious traps are easily evaded.</b> The sailors contort themselves to avoid sharp stones and plated triggers, flowing through the corridor with the ease of seasoned explorers or cutpurses. They quickly reach the pocket of the temple: a vast chasm crossed by a meager bridge with no handrails. Could this be a trial of courage?","802233":"Cross the run-down bridge","802234":"<b>You pass the trial!</b> As they wave their arms to keep their balance, your sailors brush against ropes suspended around the bridge, hidden by a clever camouflage of paint and shadow play. They grasp the ropes to steady their footing, and a distant mechanism clicks. A rumbling door opens on the other side of the chasm, revealing the exit - and, on its threshold, a shiny artifact.","802235":"<b>Nothing rewards your sailors' recklessness.</b> It's unclear whether the bridge is shaking because of its own frailty, or because of your explorers' quivering legs. Soon the crew are on their knees, creeping across the moldy planks and begging for their mothers. They reach the other side without a scratch, save for their wounded pride, and find a tunnel which leads them outside after some more crawling.","802236":"Climb down the chasm","802237":"<b>The climb is child's play.</b> Rock walls provide a much steadier footing than wind-flogged masts. The sailors reach the bottom of the chasm, where they find an army of ropes stretching into the darkness above: the entrails of the temple's mechanisms! They find what might have been the Mesoan engineers' entrance, and leave the temple with filled pockets and memories.","802238":"<b>The crew aren't as strong as they think.</b> An officer loses her nerve and her grip, slipping down the stone, with a soft thud marking the end of her fall. Smooth slithering sounds hush her desperate cries. The floor is covered in snakes!","802239":"Find a way among the snakes","802240":"Scare the snakes away with torches","802241":"<b>The sailors manage to flee.</b> Too occupied by the convulsing mass of the fallen officer, the reptiles don't notice the furtive crew as they tip toes past them and escape through the first tunnel available. The explorers emerge outside the temple, stunned by their survival.","802242":"<b>They cannot read the snakes' behaviour.</b> The sailors progress across the wriggling floor, so focused on their movements that they don't see the mass of snakes backing away from them, and piling against the sole exit. The crew has no choice but to run into the tunnel before it ends up filled with snakes, and several sailors end up as reptile diner.","802243":"<b>The crew stand their ground as well as they can.</b> The burning torches are swung before the snakes, forcing them back from the sailors. The officer is pulled to her feet and dragged with the rest of the crew through a windy tunnel, leading them outside, empty-handed, but safe.","802244":"<b>What should the snakes be scared of, exactly?</b> Your crew flap the torches around them in a ballet of shaking hands and dripping sweat, but fail to make even one step forward before a young sailor waves his torch past the limits of safety. The snakes leap on your crew, leaving none but a single witness alive.","802245":"<b>The challenge demands more coordination than the crew has.</b> Surprised by the brushing elbow of a comrade, a sailor squeals in terror and jumps back, triggering trap after trap of flying arrows, flaming oils, poison sprays. Once the most sensational traps have simmered down, the roof collapses and seals the exit, as sand slowly starts to fall from the walls.","802246":"Look for a hidden mechanism","802248":"Try and find a weak wall to break","802249":"<b>The patterns of the mechanism do not escape your hunters' probing.</b> Upon close and cool-headed inspection, one the sand-spewing hourglass engravings appears to be protruding from the wall. The sailors smash the button, forcing the wall to open and reveal an exit. They flee from the sand, and the temple itself.","802250":"<b>If there is a mechanism, the crew cannot find it.</b> Sand keeps pouring into the room, blinding the sailors as it forces its way into their noses and mouths. The explorers utter muted screams. As the sand packs up against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.","802251":"<b>The old wall caves in effortlessly.</b> Following the sand pouring from the cracks, the explorers identify the wall from which most grains seem to be falling. They stave it in, causing a dusty outpour which fills their lungs, before clearing to reveal sunlight. They hasten through the self-made exit, and end up on the beach on which they'd left their ship.","802252":"<b>The explorers bang on the walls helplessly.</b> Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them as it forces its way into their noses and mouth. The crew utters muted screams. As the sand packs up against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.","802253":"<b>The boulder moves!</b> The combined effort of the crew manages to lift the giant stone out of its socket. As the boulder rolls, a loud snap resonates and the rock bounces back into place. A wall falls behind the sailors and, in a concert of grating dirt and destroyed stone, it starts to advance towards the crew.","802254":"<b>The boulder doesn't move.</b> Your explorers push, nudge and thrust, but the exit stays sealed. They have no choice but to obey the maze's invitation.","802255":"Push against the wall to stop it","802256":"Look for another way out","802257":"<b>The ancient wall cannot resist your crew's pressure.</b> They grunt in unison and breathe in rhythm with their effort. One, two. The wall stops in its tracks. One. It shivers. Two. The wall crumbles, revealing a large opening under its railings: the crew finds the body of a less lucky adventurer, one hand clawing at the threshold of a gaping exit, the other gripping an oversized diamond.","802258":"<b>The wall is unfazed by your crew's efforts.</b> As an explorer gets to her knees to pray in the face of her imminent death, she notices an engraving much less elaborate than the temple's decorations: letters that have been scribbled in a language she can actually understand! <br/><b>\"Crawling by day, airborne by night.\"</b><br/>Right underneath the scribbling are four buttons depicting animals.","802259":"Press the sloth","802260":"Press the bat","802261":"Press the butterfly","802262":"Press the cockroach","802263":"<b>Wrong answer.</b> The brick above the button opens and an arrow flies into the crew, perforating the throat of a sailor, and leaving a red line in the cheek of the button-presser. The floor under the explorers tilts and they roll, a helpless mass of arms and legs which slides along the tunnel before being expelled outside the temple.","802264":"<b>Wrong answer.</b> As she presses the button, the sailor feels no resistance, and keeps pushing the carved stone until her full arm is in the wall. She can feel something furry on her skin, a little bit rough, and a bit... She screams! As fangs dig into her flesh, a legion of bats emerge through the newly opened wall - and the only way out is through the bats' nest. The crew emerges from the temple covered in blood, and crippled with a lasting fear of the dark.","802265":"<b>Right answer!</b> The sailor hits the butterfly button and celebrates as the wall stops advancing, and bricks whirl into the floor to form a staircase. The crew emerges from the temple, wondering about the intentions of whoever thought to carve such needlessly complicated riddles in their mother tongue.","802266":"<b>Wrong answer.</b>As the cockroach is pressed, the insect shivers and shakes the dust off its shell. It's alive! The ceiling opens and a swarm of cockroaches flies into the room, aiming for the sailors' mouths. The crew smash the insects with whatever objects they have at hand, their horror giving them wings of their own, pushing them to climb the walls until they reach the outside.","802267":"<b>The unfazed explorers rapidly find an exit.</b> They notice how the floor's cobblestones move to let the advancing wall pass, and wait for the right moment to jump into the space between wall and floor. One by one, they land into the room below, where a large opening to the outside lets in the morning light, revealing a spectacle of spiderwebs surrounding a delicate piece of sculpted mahogany.","802268":"<b>The sailors do not find an exit.</b> All stones look alike, and the crew lacks the ability to appraise which rock might be more important than the others. The advancing wall looms ever closer, ready to crush their bones, before suddenly leaning forward and pushing the sailors to the floor, which in turn opens to eject the explorers outside the temple. Yes, they are alive - but the very sight of a stone wall will scare them for years to come.","802269":"Song Of The Sea","802270":"<b>The lookout is sure of himself: he has sighted a mermaid.</b> In the hot noon sun, sailors suspend their duties and rush to inspect the mirrory waters for a sign of the creature. Lo! There is something — a glimmer of silver tail, and a sweet yet melancholy melody that follows behind it. Surely it's a mermaid's song!","802272":"Ask for expert opinion","802274":"<b>\"Something just as rare, and no less magical!\" chuckles your zoologist,</b> who proceeds to dive after the creature, resurfacing a short while later. \"Poor little soul seems to have been separated from its mother,\" your zoologist splutters, clutching a juvenile specimen of an obscure sea-dwelling species. \"Would you chaps kindly run her a bath? I think we'd better take her with us.\" From now on, whenever your crew feel sad, they can stop by the creature's tub and enjoy its special warblings.","802275":"Answer the mermaid's call with a sailor's chant","802276":"<b>Not one, but a dozen strange sea creatures answer the spirited shanty,</b> swimming and leaping joyfully alongside your vessel. Since they seem like no creature you've ever seen, it might be an opportunity to catch a specimen for the benefit of natural science...","802277":"Try to catch one alive","802278":"<b>A fine catch!</b> Taking care not to hurt the beautiful creature, your fishermen haul the great net from the water, and let her slop into a tub they've prepared in the hold. The crew take to calling her \"Mermaid\". Though she has been separated from her pod, she seems to enjoy being doted upon, and will certainly be kept well fed.

There is no greater source of pride for a sailor than having made peace with the ocean.","802282":"<b>The mermaid vanishes.</b> The sailors drawl a patriotic war ballad they are fond of, but it has a threatening air, and the siren does not deign to answer. Blue in the face from trying, the sailors mourn the ill omen of the mermaid's disappearance, permitting themselves no more thoughts of she and her sisters, or their undersea kingdom.","802283":"<b>When the mermaid disappears, a sailor dives in after her!</b> Your irreverent sailors pick a lewd shanty to sing. Angry this moment of innocence is being spoiled, the impassioned young man tosses himself into sea to pursue the fleeting creature. He is not much of a swimmer.","802284":"Save the poor boy!","802285":"<b>He's coughed up a lot of water, but he'll live.</b> The navigators scream for someone to jump in after him, to give them time to bring the ship about. The boy is already sinking by the time his comrade catches up with him, but he's hauled to the surface where the ship is now waiting. When he finally comes to, the boy describes how beautiful the mermaid was, and how invitingly her tail swished. The sailors are so jealous of the boy, they instantly regret having bothered to save him. ","802286":"<b>Pursuing in the ship is a mistake.</b> You lose sight of the boy, until someone realises he must have slipped underneath the keel. Divers emerge with the pale dead boy in their arms.

Whatever that noble feeling was, you're fairly certain it won't be the emotion written on his face as he asphyxiates. His letters later show a preexisting disillusionment with life aboard the ship, describing a \"culture of bullying most uncivil.\"   ","802289":"Convince the sailors to ignore the creature","802290":"<b>Duty trumps distraction.</b> Awoken by the earnest plea of the presiding officer, the sailors return immediately to their posts. The officer makes the case that it \"can be a great source of pride to have not given in to temptation,\" and that \"this is our way of life at sea.\" Plugging their ears with wax like the heroes of an ancient tale, the men now seem more concentrated than ever on overcoming the far greater challenges ahead. ","802291":"<b>Curiosity gets the better of your crew.</b> If the fable is true, it would be against all superstition to ignore it. The men ignore the squawked orders of their superiors and begin muttering among themselves about how best to catch the mermaid's attention. When one grabs hold of the wheel to change course, it is clear things have got out of hand. The bo'sun, finding this challenge to authority thoroughly unacceptable, brandishes the whip.","802293":"Have the sailors flogged","802294":"<b>The sailors grumble back to their posts.</b> Resorting to such primitive naval discipline has left a bit of a bad atmosphere, but you doubt it will last forever. Besides, the bos'un only gave them a very gentle bruising — anything more than that is frowned upon these days. At least those silly thoughts of mermaids have been well and truly banished.","802295":"<b>What you have done is illegal,</b> and the crew have no difficulty making their displeasure known. After the bo'sun has beaten a man's back to a pulp, the crew gather on the top deck, where the cries of the mermaid can still be heard, although it sounds like weeping now. \"That act was outlawed a half century ago. We hereby notify you of our forthcoming testimony against the bo'sun in a court of law — that is, if we ever manage to return.\" Morale aboard stoops to a new low. ","802296":"Drop the issue and let them be","802297":"<b>Discipline aboard this ship is lax.</b> Convinced that their misconduct will go unpunished, the sailors take to negotiating, and even outright ignoring the tedious instructions of the officers. The use of \"mermaid\" as a keyword becomes synonymous with this rebellious undercurrent, which is sure to blight the rest of the voyage.","802299":"In the Grasp of the Tentacular ","802300":"<b>Could it be the kraken?!</b> What else could possess \"tentacles wide as a barrel and long as bowsprits\", as your lookout claims to have spotted protruding from the treacle-black swell? Creature of legend or not, a shadow below the surface is hurtling towards your ship at full speed!","802301":"Fire a torpedo at the thing","802304":"<b>The hulking cephalopod is no match for the torpedo!</b> The self-propelled projectile requires no special effort to dispatch, and yet its underwater prowess is indisputible. It crashes into the kraken with a wallop that sends a profusion of octo-bits frothing to the surface. The crew are delighted to discover the flesh is cooked, yet not at all rubbery.","802305":"Kill the monster","802306":"<b>THUNK! An excellent shot!</b> The harpoon lodges into the creature's amply-sized brain. It takes little effort to haul the reddish mantle and decimette of long pulpous limbs aboard. No-one is going to believe this trophy when they see it — or that something of this size swam at such threatening velocity! Its eyes alone are half a metre wide!","802307":"<b>Sloppy shooting from your pod of suckers.</b> The twisting aberration slinks and jets obliquely, its mantle engorged and thrumming with arcane energy. Its lip-like suckers pucker and latch onto the hull, levering its beaked face up above the starboard rail in a game of peek-a-boo. It is vast!","802308":"Slice its meaty tentacles!","802309":"<b>The monstrosity detaches violently!</b> Your men hack fiercely and without relent at a key tentacle until it severs. The loopeyed beast blubbers a pained raspberry, coating the deck with plankton-infused clamminess, before tearing itself back into the sea, with a large section of your ship in tow! Some repairs will be needed!","802310":"<b>There are just too many legs!</b> Having been interrupted at dinner, your sailors try to improvise a dissection with their knives and forks, but the monstrosity refuses to become calamari. Its innumerable tendrils cavort, punching holes and tossing sailors at whim! One unfortunate sailor is flung so perfectly that his return trajectory lands him directly, and fatally, atop a flagpole. Having satiated itself on flesh and timber, the kraken detaches, and bolts away with typical flourish.","802311":"Blow it away!","802312":"<b>Right in the mandibles!</b> The kraken inhales the slew of heavy artillery and is propelled outwards and star-like, before plummeting to the depths with a good part of your ship still in its grip. Repairs will be needed! You cannot think why the creature was so offended by your presence, but at least it now has some memento of your meeting to clutch onto.","802313":"<b>Your gunmen cannot keep their feet long enough.</b> The ctenidious cephalopod rocks the ship to and fro, shaking your boys from the big guns, before sealing itself over an open window and sucking up men as if it had a straw in an ice cream sundae. Eventually, after deciding it's poked and prodded enough, the monstrosity relinquishes its goily grasp, and flops back to the deep to digest the better part of your crew into a liquid.","802315":"Outrun the thing","802316":"<b>A powerful spurt of propulsion!</b> The unnatural power of your steam ship eclipses the jetting shadow from the far, far depths. The ship's horn sounds a farewell salute to the creature, who those present swear is equipped with two clocktower eyes, within which ink-black pupils swim delirious. For now, it seems, its wait for a suitable mate must go on.","802317":"<b>The wind is with you.</b> Whatever that bird-beaked nest of serpents below actually is, it relaxes in its piston-like pursuit of your ship once your crew have succeeded in catching the best of the prevailing breeze. Those present swear it was equipped with two clocktower eyes, within which ink-black pupils swam delirious. For now, it seems, its wait for a suitable mate must go on.","802318":"<b>Your crew cannot manage to disentangle themselves,</b> for the creature is in search of a mate, and filled with frightful lust. Only once it has clambered up the side, and attached its hectocotylus to your ship, does it begin to have misgivings about the romantic potential of this union, and start thinking about dinner instead...","802320":"Teeth of the Mountain","802321":"<b>A track leading over these impenetrable mountains should be a blessing,</b> yet your men are having doubts. Your guide, for a start, absolutely refuses to follow the path. In fact, the very idea scares him. At the base of the mountain, which juts ferrous and fibrous above the greenery like a chunk of braised meat, is a stone head carved in the rock. It grins awfully, and between its huge square teeth is what appears to be a severed arm.","802322":"Follow the track","802323":"<b>The trail leads through the centre of a hilltop village,</b> the straw shelters improbably nestled between steep-sided slopes. But it is the appearance of the inhabitants that astonishes: unlike all the other peoples of this great rainforest, they are tall and pale, blond-haired and blue-eyed. \"But why? What can their story be?\" someone chuckles, only to find their companions are oddly tense.","802324":"Approach the inhabitants","802325":"<b>Your diplomat establishes a common heritage!</b> At least, their language certainly suggests as much. There are familiar sounding terms such as \"gonne\" and \"gun\", for example, although their words for water, tree and mountain are consistent with local dialects. Their mythology appears to centre around a tall, blue-eyed ancestor, who came long ago from the Old World, and eloped up this mountain with a local woman in order to conceive the eagles who now circle its peak. Your party receives the stories with great interest, and are made to feel very welcome.","802326":"<b>Your envoy's approach is based upon an assumption.</b> \"Hello!\" she exclaims suddenly, \"What brings you to these godforsaken hills?\" But the villagers cannot understand her. They begin to close in on her.","802327":"Rescue her","802328":"<b>She is saved, at least.</b> \"Feels like we killed one of our own today,\" says a soldier, in reference to the villager they shot. \"Not really...\" another replies, \"...but it's terrible he had to die, nonetheless.\" Your expedition leaves the mountain pass quickly, so the pale and mysterious community can mourn this violation.","802329":"<b>The enemy take the high ground,</b> their guns and projectiles proving rather effective for them. They rush their hostage to the neck of the pass, and up onto a large rocky outcrop. It's the perfect cover from which to assault your party, exposed as they are on the bald crest of a slope. Men are dying — it's hopeless to remain. Later, when imagining the fate of the poor diplomat, the survivors cannot help but remember the stone head they saw, and the human limb in its jaws.","802331":"Leave her","802332":"<b>It's a dreadful feeling.</b> Scrambling down the mountain, your expedition hears a sudden and piercing scream. \"You never know, she might yet survive,\" someone remarks — but later, as they are imagining the fate of the poor diplomat, your survivors cannot help but remember the giant stone head they saw at the foot of the mountain, and the human limb in its jaws.","802333":"Watch from a distance","802334":"<b>A shortcut may have been ignored, but fair progress is made.</b> Declining the invitation to enter the territory of whomever made that gruesome stone carving, your crew feel a sense of relief, despite the extra effort the alternative route will demand of them. Along the way, your officers surmise that trangressing into the territory of the local people is seldom necessary, or desirable.","802336":"<b>Not too clever.</b> Fearing exposure up on the slopes, your men opt to tiptoe through the village. Perhaps they just smell too delicious, because the pallid, hungry-looking villagers emerge from their dwellings as one, equipped with all sorts of sharp-looking implements...","802337":"Apologise for trespassing","802338":"<b>Your diplomat finds common ground,</b> although not what you might expect. It just so happens that these people are about to tuck in to a feast of human remains. Your diplomat reassures the expedition, \"It is their practice to eat their loved ones when they die. Rather beautiful when you think about it.\" Nevertheless, your crew are rather pleased not to have to partake, and continue on their way.","802339":"<b>Your diplomat fails to control her nerves.</b> She breaks down whimpering, and one of your manly men muscles in front of her. \"Now listen here!\" he bellows, \"Get back you fiends! Get back or I'll cut you down!\" Yet, pale and uncomprehending, still they come. Your brute wavers, and looks as if he's seen a ghost. He turns and runs down the mountain with the others. It will be a hard road on from here.","802340":"Draw your weapons!","802341":"<b>Where discretion fails, force prevails.</b> Your crew are unfazed by the singular appearance of the villagers, and spring into action. The villagers' expressions remain resolute, even as they flee up the mountain to take refuge with the condors. But there is sadness behind those eyes: this isn't fair. Your men loot the village.","802342":"<b>Many amongst your expedition will be eaten,</b> or so your survivors believe. They should have fought as if their lives depended on it, but the ferocity and ingenuity with which the mountain ghosts took them was a great shock. The question as to the provenance of the local people has only become cloudier, but those who fled the mountain will not forget them any time soon.  ","802343":"<b>Your explorers find themselves surrounded.</b> Those leading the group have their heads so buried in their maps, they fail to notice they've blundered right through a village. The villagers are oddly tall and pale, with blue eyes and blonde hair. They look hungry, and are equipped with all sorts of sharp-looking implements...","802344":"Avoid the tracks","802347":"<b>A shortcut may have been ignored, but fair progress is made regardless.</b> Declining the invitation to enter the territory of whomever made that gruesome stone carving, your crew feel a sense of relief, despite the extra effort the alternative route will demand of them. Along the way, your officers surmise that transgressing into the territory of the local people is seldom necessary, or desirable.","802348":"<b>Avoiding the tracks means getting lost,</b> the steep contour of the valley overwhelming what limited grasp of the geography your explorers have. They emerge a week of aimless wandering later, devoured not by the cannibals rumoured to inhabit these parts, but by the mosquitoes and leeches so at home near the flooded river.","802351":"Cities of Gold","802352":"<b>The faded ink... The gold leaf... Could this map lead to El Doodah?</b> It fluttered into the hands of your sailors, who believe it to be the most bona fide clue in centuries as to the location of the city of gold. They're already dreaming of the hulking neckchains they'll find, and how well they'll set off their earrings. Why, even the captain has suggested hiring a guide! Yet the greedy have come this way before, and it never seems to end well...","802353":"Hire a guide","802354":"El Doodah, you say? Yes, I know something about it...","802355":"Confirm","802356":"<b>He has been searching for the Mesoan city his whole life,</b>  and the intensity with which he examines the map suggests he is on the verge of a breakthrough. \"Further west than I've ever been,\" he looks to the forest \"but there's no reason it couldn't lie beyond Lake Guavatita\". A few days' hike up the river basin and Lake Guavatita shows herself, just like the jagged dagger of water on your map. Beside a high waterfall, <b>your guide shows you a stone marked with Mesoan glyphs. </b>\"This marks the end of the trail,\" he says.","802357":"Cancel","802358":"<b>Looks like you're on your own.</b> The guide scoffs at your valuation of his services. \"Everyone from here to Porto Tristeza will hear what a greedy bunch of conquistador pigs you are!\"","802359":"Read the map yourselves","802361":"<b>The trail ends at a stone covered in glyphs.</b> Following the confluence of high waters, as they weave in and out of one another, you arrive several days later at the lake marked on the faded map. A keen-eyed young whippersnapper notices some unmarked stones have been placed at regular intervals, which culminate at a waterfall, besides a stone whose inscription must have been made long ago.","802362":"Interpret the Mesoan glyphs","802363":"<b>You strike gold!</b> Metaphorically, at least. Your anthropologist reads from the glyphs, and scampers off yelling, \"The fourth rain god! It means North!\" When the archaeologist wades back through the small lagoon, they have a big smile on their face, having found a hoard that's of far greater archaeological value than its financial worth! This may not be the city of El Doodah, but it's remarkable enough!","802364":"Survey the area","802365":"<b>A secret passage!</b> In a nearby rock face you find a gap, scarcely wide enough to slip through, that might easily have been missed but for the thoroughness of the search. One-by-one, the expedition enters to find themselves in a natural cavern, through which a cool wind whips. A little light reveals <b>a rock fall blocking the way ahead,</b> and <b>crawlways branching in all directions.</b>","802366":"Clear the rock fall","802367":"<b>What wonders laid bare!</b> A sturdy scaffold is built to support the ceiling, before a human chain clears the debris. The antechamber ahead radiates with shining metals! It is a hoard of far greater archaeological value than its material worth! This may not be the city of El Doodah, but it's quite remarkable enough!","802368":"<b>The whole roof seems to give way!</b> Perhaps they should have thought to secure the ceiling first, for as they move a large stone, a primeval bellow comes from above. \"Run! RUN!\" is the cry, as they all rush out. When the noise subsides, the crew return to discover the passage has been sealed. In any case, some have been injured by the falling debris, and must urgently be taken to a doctor.","802369":"Investigate the crawlways","802370":"<b>Your cavers triumph!</b> The clammy confinement of the narrow tunnels makes them hard to negotiate at first, but your potholers never lose their sense of direction, pushing forward on their tummies until a fresh breeze tingles. \"There! A city!\" The cavern opens out into an extensive underground ruin, preserved by its clay surrounds. El Doodah or not, there are no doubt some remarkable finds to be made!     ","802371":"<b>Few have any experience of caving.</b> The route they take is clammy and claustrophobic, and seems to be leading nowhere when there's a sudden and awful screeching of bats! A man loses his footing and falls through a gap, breaking his leg. The confined space means his rescue is especially tiresome, and takes several hours to complete — the narrow cave filling with moans whenever anyone so much as grazes the injured leg. <b>You are forced to abandon your search for El Doodah.</b>","802372":"<b>\"Not so much as a glimmer of this golden city! Not even behind the waterfall,\"</b> the lieutenant teases, \"and besides, these 'glyphs'...\" He drops to his haunches and feels the grooves in the stone, \"Looks like plain water erosion to me.\" The captain nods. \"Alright men, you heard the lieutenant. Time to give up this fool's errand.\" Your expedition leaves disappointed.","802373":"Divine the meaning of the glyph stone","802374":"<b>Praise be, a secret passage!</b> One of the men is unexpectedly knowledgeable on Mesoan theology. \"That symbol's in my improving bunk book sir, Cap'n, sir — means god of the underworld.\" Sure enough, in a nearby rock face, your crew find a gap scarcely wide enough to slip through, and one that might easily have been missed. One-by-one, the expedition enters to find themselves in a natural cavern, through which a cool wind whips. A little light reveals <b>a rock fall blocking the way ahead,</b> and <b>crawlways branching in all directions.</b> ","802375":"<b>The glyph stone provides no inspiration.</b> \"It's a myth! A lie!\" Your frustrated lieutenant kicks at it. \"Did we expect this golden city to simply descend upon a cloud for us?\" The captain sees only one way to dispel the frustration. \"Alright men, you heard the lieutenant. Time to give up this fool's errand.\" Your expedition leaves disappointed.","802377":"<b>Your men succumb to their greed.</b> The map must have been a cruel hoax! The worst thing was that it raised their hopes. Some of its landmarks — a high waterfall, a boulder improbably perched — are found to really exist. Beyond that, there's nothing — yet gold fever has already set in. Weeks, months go by before some of your people get a grip of themselves again.","802378":"Refuse to believe in a city of gold","802379":"<b>Everyone is disappointed.</b> Aside from those in it for the riches, many believe a gilt-edged opportunity to unearth important discoveries has been passed up. After all, that is the whole purpose of expeditions such as this, is it not?","802381":"Call Of The Devil","802382":"<b>Can it be the voice of a child this deep in the jungle?</b> The expedition has taken a several-day sojourn inland, looking for citrus to save them from scurvy. Taking shelter during a particularly heavy cloudburst, they are sure they can hear children's voices through the pitter-patter of rain. Your men strain to see where it may be coming from. \"It is Lucifer, of cloven hoof, leading us astray!\" whispers the priest, \"Pay him no heed!\"","802383":"Let your zoologist speak","802384":"Ignore the devil voices","802385":"Find a more rational explanation","802386":"<b>\"Hush you insufferable fool, it is a marvellous species of talking bird!\"</b> exclaims the zoologist. Following a trail of excrement on the rainforest floor, the zoologist soon finds a colourful feather. \"Raaawwwk!\" splutters something in the trees above. The expedition crane up their necks to find the most colourful avian peering sidelong down at them. The specimen is duly captured for the benefit of the natural sciences.","802387":"<b>The sailors close their minds to the voices.</b> With the stubbornness of true believers, your crew convince themselves it is devil speak, repeating \"I renounce him, his demons and his works!\" Their faith is affirmed when the rain stops, and the voices desist. Later that day, they stumble across Eden; a thicket of Camucamu fruit trees. \"Very tart fruits indeed,\" says the doctor, \"precisely what we've been wanting.\"","802388":"<b>The voices are too persistent for them to ignore.</b> \"I must know what they are!\" one man cries, and the priest cannot seem to dissuade him or others from venturing from the shelter to seek them out. The further they go from the camp, the clearer the child-like chatter becomes. It feels inevitable something terrible is going to happen.","802389":"At least let the priest go ahead","802390":"Run for the ocean","802391":"<b>The priest's incantations subdue the Devil.</b> The priest swats his flickering torch in front of the party, bellowing incessantly \"God is my salvation, the Lord be my sword and shield!\", his mouth brimming with rainwater, until someone shakes him by the shoulder. He startles, but his comrade reassures him. \"The voices have ceased! You have saved us — saved us from temptation!\"  ","802392":"<b>The devil noise drowns out the priest's prayer.</b> As he anoints each sailor hastily with holy water, a voice identical to his screeches \"Get away devil!\", and raucous laughter erupts from the forest all around. Men and women run for dear life, only for the jungle to swallow them up. The ship feels very empty on the onward journey. \"Led to the underworld,\" the captain prods the disgraced priest in the chest, \"by the agents of Lucifer!\"","802393":"<b>The voices are gone, but the scurvy is terrible.</b> Scarpering from the jungle, the crew leave all their supplies behind. In addition, the expedition has not found the vitamin-rich fruit it so badly needed. It will be several weeks before new land is sighted, and the crew's teeth and hair are already falling out.","802394":"<b>It's not children they've heard, but birds!</b> The hunters among the crew know it right away, signalling to the others to be quiet as they scan the trees for the cacophonous culprits. Before too long, one of the brightly-coloured beauties makes itself known. The hunters manage to capture it, and bring the little marvel back on board for the benefit of the natural sciences.","802395":"<b>Fear incites a rash decision.</b> The majority tremble in silence, as the eerie voice draws ever nearer, except for one cocksure officer who jabs his pistol every which way, looking for something to shoot. Seeing movement among the trees he fires, only to see his bullet graze the shoulder of an indigenous girl, perhaps five or six years old. It is likely she has never come across the white devil before, and she disappears into the trees wailing. She will survive. The officer, however, is clutching his chest — he has had a heart attack, and he dies.","802397":"The Treasure of<br/>Hassan Ben Sahid","802398":"<b>An old man claims to know the location of a great treasure.</b> You've stopped over at a sandswept port.

There are simply too many stones to know where to start — and no way of guessing which belonged to Ben Sahid. The crew return to the ship, believing that at least they tried.","802411":"<b>The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!</b> \"The map smells sickly sweet with something,\" says one keen-nosed officer, \"dates, perhaps!\" After hunting around, the officers come across a lush grove of date palm. \"Our thirst is quenched!\" they cry, for there in its centre is a working noria, which might have been running for centuries. One of them is lowered down to the bottom of the well, where they find the most extraordinary golden hoard!

The blind man follows the eager beagles in amusement, as they set off at a giddy clip. He knows the fort cannot be where Ben Sahid's treasure is buried, since it belonged to a great enemy of his who came from the far north. Nevertheless, it is full of unclaimed riches!","802414":"<b>The map appears worthless without the annotations.</b> \"We could have just remained in that wonderful old square under that marvellous arched gate, and sipped our coffee on this beautiful sunny day.

Only the fore and aft sails are left to flail in the wind to keep a semblance of control over the ship.","802479":"<b>What is faith in yourself against the rage of the heavens?</b> The sails thrash against their mast, escaping the hands of your sailors as they desperately try to reel them in. The freezing rain becomes hail, and the crew's strength melts under the relentless pounding. About half the sails are secured as the first bolts of lightning crackle over the horizon.","802481":"Sail through the storm","802482":"Wait for the storm to pass","802483":"<b>The vessel emerges from the storm, unscathed.</b> The barren masts of your ship part the tempest as the crew maneuver its jib sails and the spanker, both ridiculously small pieces of cloth in the face of the storm's fury. Still, the maneuver magnifies the importance of these sails and allows you to masterfully skirt the storm, leaving the curtain of rain just as lightning begins to strike. Entranced, the crew contemplates how they managed to defy such a grand power.","802484":"<b>Waiting would have been a better option.</b> Though the force of training helped your crew reef the sails, it doesn't reveal how to navigate the furious tempest. Sailing with nothing but the jib sails and spanker is a feat no one on your ship is capable of. The vessel is tossed about helplessly, until the storm decides to calm down.","802486":"Order the crew to finish reefing the sails","802487":"Maneuver with what sails you have left","802488":"<b>Just in time!</b> The lieutenants' preaching hits the sailors harder than the hail itself, and the crew pours their last drops of effort into reefing the remaining sail. As they finish attaching the spanker, the full strength of the tempest hits the ship. To the relief of the crew, the reefed sails take no damage, but the ship lurches helplessly, carried by the whims of the storm until it finally calms down.","802489":"<b>There's no courage in these cowards.</b> Despite the repeated calls of the lieutenants and the urgency of the situation, the sailors stay frozen in the face of the thunderstorm, awed mice before a famished cat. You can beat them into life, or say your prayers.","802490":"Threaten to flog them","802491":"Pray the storm will end","802492":"<b>The threat works.</b> The perspective of a flogging somewhat outweighs the menace of the thunderstorm, and the sailors resume their work in a panic. The sails are reefed and secured right before the heart of the storm crashes into your ship. Letting the tempest haul you through the ocean is not a pleasant experience, but at least the sailboat didn't take any damage.","802493":"<b>The threat of punishment is weak and unwarranted.</b> Rendered distraught by the storm and unable to gather their wits, your lieutenants have no power over the crew. Your sailors are too busy saving their skins to mind orders, especially when given with so little conviction. Your ship is consumed by the tempest, chewed up, ground down and spat out. Its skeletal remains drift away from the storm.","802496":"<b>Your prayers are heard.</b><br/>\"A thousand may fall at your side, <br/>Ten thousand at your right hand, <br/>But it will not come near you. <br/>You will only observe with your eyes, <br/>And see the punishment of the wicked.\"<br/>As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.","802497":"<b>The thunderstorm hits your ship with full force.</b> Call it divine punition or pure coincidence, but the tempest gathers around the vessel, and hell begins. Lightning strikes the masts and tears through the sails, igniting brief fires that are immediately doused by the hail. The deck is water, the ship is a wave - and it crashes against the sea, again and again. When at last the first sunrays bless the sailboat, its shape is left torn and mangled.","802498":"<b>To safety!</b> Maneuvering with only half your sails while facing oversized waves, pounding hail and incoming lightning is as difficult as it sounds. And yet the crew does it. Relying not on the sails, but on the ship's bilge keel and its keel-protecting apron, they spear through the wind without being driven sideways. The boat leaps over the trough of the waves, pushed by the raging force of the elements, offering as much resistance it can possibly can - until, at last, the tempest is left behind.","802499":"<b>A close call.</b> Navigating with so few sails proves more difficult than expected, and the proximity of the thunderstorm makes the sea even wilder. The ship rolls among the gigantic waves, lifted and shifted by the whims of the tempest. The crew's maneuvers amount to choosing which less terrible wave they wish to crash into. When the storm recedes, the damage is somewhat acceptable.","802500":"<b>Too slow.</b> The crew's skills are limited to classic sailing, perhaps in a bit of bad weather, but not in a storm of this magnitude. And not on a ship with half its sails reefed, and the other half flailing in the gale. Ignoring the urgency of the free sails, the sailors try to maneuver the ship, and manage to present its full flank to the waves. The tempest gladly takes the offering. It crashes into the ship, tearing both sails and men from it, before spewing the remains into calmer seas.","802501":"<b>Riding the wild wind isn't dangerous enough for your crew.</b> In a display of complete control over the ship, they somehow manage to find an invisible corridor of safe passage among the waves. The gales that should have torn the sails apart instead fill them, making the sailboat dance with a majesty at least as grand as the storm itself. Instead of leaving the tempest, the crew rides it until it calms down on its own, exhausted from carrying its new masters.","802502":"<b>A move as wasteful as it was risky.</b> Meek doesn't even begin to describe your sailors' approach: they deploy the sails in an incoherent manner, letting the wind take hold of the ship. The vessel yaws to one side, then to other, its rudder barely in contact with the water. A wave grabs a sailor and runs away with him. Any more of this, and the whole crew will follow!","802503":"Time the anchor's release to counterbalance the ship","802504":"Fill the bottom of the hold to keep it steady","802507":"<b>A bold move!</b> Releasing the anchor right as the ship reaches an upright position and begins to yaw is the perfect timing to stop the chaotic rolling. The sailboat protests against the maneuver, trembling under the insistence of the waves, but obediently follows your crew's demands as they finally steer it away from the storm. Unnerved but alive, the sailors agree that they have seen and done enough risk-taking for the day.","802508":"<b>A move too bold.</b> Timing the anchor's release to the yawing of the ship takes more competence and composure than your crew can muster. The iron cross drops as the ship rolls to the opposite side and, instead of driving the ship back to a steady position, the anchor grinds against the flank, tearing planks and railings as it falls. The waves finish the job. When the storm finally recedes, the ship is adrift, its flank gutted.","802509":"<b>Safe and sound.</b> Ignoring the battering rain as they navigate the pitching deck with skill, the sailors organise a human chain to store the upper deck's goods in the depths of the ship. The temporary ballast, accompanied by the human weight of the sailors, manages to lower the waterline and quells the ship's rolls. Hidden in the hull, and unable to do any more for their ship, the crew must wait for the storm to calm down on its own.","802510":"<b>Mayhem.</b> Disheartened by the enormity of the task, the sailors hardly listen to their lieutenants. Four crew members attempt to follow orders and unfasten the deck's supplies, only to have them roll away and slide across the deck as the ship pitches in the storm, knocking down sailors and pushing them overboard, before breaking the ship's railings and toppling its weakened masts. When the sun emerges, it reveals the emaciated silhouette of a ghost ship.","802511":"<b>Slow and steady.</b>Maybe too slow? Careful maneuvers keep your ship under favourable winds, and keep the menace of transverse waves at bay, but the storm shows no sign of relenting.","802512":"<b>You would have been better off with a windjammer.</b> Navigating the ship through the storm proves trickier than expected, and the navigators' lack of familiarity with steam ships shows as they rely on the sails to maneuver, despite the ship's peculiar lack of a middle mast. It doesn't take long for the ship to protest against the poor handling. It yaws, and a loud rumble erupts from the hull: the ballast has come unfastened!","802513":"Overheat the engines to outrun the storm","802514":"Maintain a steady pace and let the storm push you off track","802515":"<b>A power stronger than the elements themselves.</b> Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit; the screw propeller moving far beyond what human sight can perceive, propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.","802516":"<b>You should have been more patient.</b> The crew cannot manage such a brusque change of pace, and their meager knowledge of the machinery is not enough to demand so much from the engines without paying an equivalent price. The ship vaults away from the storm in a cacophony of complaining metal and agonizing devices - when at last the tempest is gone, the engines require your immediate attention and repairs.","802521":"Fasten the ballast back into place","802522":"Make use of the steamship's sails to survive","802523":"<b>Your prayers are heard.</b><br/>\"A thousand may fall at your side, <br/>Ten thousand at your right hand, <br/>But it will not come near you. <br/>You will only observe with your eyes, <br/>And see the punishment of the wicked.\"<br/>As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.","802524":"<b>Too heavy, too dangerous.</b> Your sailors are ill-prepared to handle the massive basalt stones that act as ballast. They try to secure the stones in place, but the ship continues to pitch: their footing is unsteady, and the rocks are so, so heavy. A sudden yaw sends the basalt rolling into them, and your sailors are knocked down, crushed like clay figures. There is nothing more to be done but wait for the ire of the tempest to pass.","802525":"<b>You run a pretty decent storm jib!</b> Navigating the steam ship like a good old sailboat, the navigators rely on the sails alone to steady the ship's erratic movements, and strain the rudder this way and that. It is fearless! The gale hits the wet sails with all its might, inflating them to their limit, as the sudden force breaks the ship out of its pitching. The navigators seize the opportunity to escape the storm, to the delighted clamour of the crew.","802526":"<b>Disaster.</b> Proving once more how inept they are at navigating this ship, your sailors attempt that which should never be attempted: they try to go against the wind. As the ship twirls, a gale strikes it with full force, transforming its yaw into a full-length broaching. The masts plunge into the sea, and there is no more up or down, and no more sky or deck. Everything is water. When the seas drain away, allowing the ship to sway back into position, there is no trace of the sailors taken by the storm.","802527":"<b>A power stronger than the elements themselves.</b> Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit; the screw propeller moving far beyond what human sight can perceive, propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.","802528":"<b>The delicate machinery is handled brutishly.</b> Assuming that the engine's heat is directly proportional to the ship's speed, the engineer overheats the steamer and brings the boiler way over capacity. The temperature rises, the pressure swells and the metal quivers, until one of the engines explodes, killing the engineer on the spot.","802529":"Attempt to use the remaining engine without your engineer","802530":"Shut off the engines and rely on your sails","802531":"<b>An unexpected turnaround.</b> A sailor steps forward: she's spent the trip observing the engineer, she says, and thinks she can handle the machinery. The lack of other volunteers, frightened by the engineer's death, leaves her the only candidate. She handles the remaining engine with a notable, if amateurish skill, and the steam ship emerges from the storm in one piece. Still, several sailors whisper about the ill luck of letting a woman save them.","802533":"<b>From bad to worse.</b> The sailors have even less skill than the engineer who, let us insist on this point, died while trying to practise his specialty. The crew tries to push this thing and pull that other thing. The pieces of metal are kicked to the best of the crew's abilities, until the air pump's valve bursts open, filling the entire room with burning steam, and forcing the sailors outside. The valve must be closed, and a volunteer offers to face the miniature hell.","802534":"Forget engineering, and hope the Lord will protect the volunteer","802536":"Insist on using your crafting wits, and protect him yourself","802537":"<b>If not skill, at least courage is rewarded.</b> The volunteer rushes inside the engine room to close the leaking valve, screaming a Glory Be as the steam broils his skin. Both steam and storm recede once the valve is slammed shut, and the crew can take its time repairing the abused machinery. The volunteer spends the rest of the trip preaching the Lord's grace, his incessant sermon making the other sailors regret the tempest and its terrifying shrieks.","802538":"<b>Hell indeed.</b> Whether the volunteer lacked faith, or the Lord lacked attention, it is only for Him to know. The man enters the engine room and can hardly touch the leaking valve before the steam devours him whole, large blisters feeding on his flesh while the whistling valve covers his screams. There is no distinguishing the man's agony from the machinery's cries, and the door is hurriedly sealed shut. The inhumane shrieks continue to resound through the ship for the rest of the trip.","802539":"<b>The best of a spread of bad options.</b> The volunteer penetrates the engine room wrapped in layers of wet cloths, as the crew provides ventilation by rapidly opening and closing the door, avoiding the steam with damp armour of their own. The man manages to close the valve, and the rest of the steam is evacuated in the same ridiculously plain manner. The immediate danger is avoided, and the crew wisely decides to avoid any more risk-taking, and wait for the storm to end on its own.","802540":"<b>Don't you know when to stop?</b> The sailor covers himself in damp cloths and enters the engine room, only for the steam to contaminate his wet armour with its insufferable heat. He springs from the room covered in blisters, a monster of molten skin which howls agony beyond human comprehension, his cries echoed by the tempest itself. The steam follows him out of the room, and burns all the sailors within its grasp, taking delight in the stolen flesh until it finally recedes, replete thanks to the stubbornness of the crew.","802541":"<b>Audacious!</b> Abandoning the steam engines, the crew focuses its efforts on using all available sails on the ship. The sailors may not have faced tempests this grand before, but they have crossed seas and braved oceans aboard all kinds of vessels: navigation is in their blood. They face the winds, ignore the waves, and lock the steering wheel into place, allowing the ship to stay steady until the storm passes. Not the most natural of solutions for a steam ship, but a good display of skill nonetheless.","802542":"<b>Reckless!</b> Attempting to face the tempest without the ship's main power source is folly, and the crew cannot handle the safety sails as well as they imagined. They try to face the waves to break their momentum, but the ship's mishandling lets it drift - and offers its flanks to the tempest. When the sun finally pierces the clouds, it reveals a spectacle of lacerated sails, flooded supplies, and disgruntled sailors.","802543":"<b>The storm passes.</b> With the sails reefed to avoid damage, the sailors have only themselves to care about: they bury under the deck in wet bundles, shivering under the biting cold of the unremitting downpour. The endless wait is dispelled by a timid sun, and the expedition can finally resume.","802544":"<b>A negligible change of course.</b> Letting the storm push your ship as it pleases upsets the most hot-headed sailors, but those with an actual brain upstairs appreciate the prudent approach. When the storm recedes, the ship's slight change of course takes a full week to be corrected - a decent trade-off in exchange for your safety.","802546":"Apostasy","802547":"<b>The crew need some common ground.</b> It is a fact that your crew were recruited regardless of their origins or beliefs, and your officers now wonder if this was a mistake. After weeks of lasting rainstorms, the more devout sailors raise their voice: this constant punishment is testimony to His obvious displeasure at the heresy aboard.

At a gallop, they have boundless energy, and <b>the thieves' headstart is gone in no time.</b> The skunks are surrounded, stripped, and left to the elements. The stolen monies are returned to the coffers, and the expedition is fandangoing once more!","802581":"<b>Your sailors are not made to catch land animals.</b> The hunt ends in failure, the most your crew saw of a wild horse being the weathered tracks on the dry roads. Instead of leading your hunters to a herd, the tracks point them to a run-down town of wooden buildings - several houses and a single saloon - its lanterns brightening with the growing darkness. Night is well on its way, and tracking the thieves seems almost impossible now.","802582":"Ask the locals for help","802584":"Avoid trouble and simply give up","802585":"<b>The locals agree to help.</b> Your diplomat carefully raises the subject of thieves with a man of imposing authority, the sheriff in charge of the small town. Their modus operandi is familiar to him: a local gang is famous for sneaking around foreign businessmen, but he never would have imagined they'd be so bold as to rob a ship. If the robbery was today, he says, the thieves are sure to come and celebrate at the saloon tonight.","802586":"<b>Your crew are held responsible for the deserters' actions.</b> Instead of probing around to get an idea of the runaways' reputation, your diplomat immediately asks about the thieves. The men are well-known - in the worst way - and the locals are shocked to hear your crew hosted them, regardless of the theft. The sailors are forced to leave when surrounded by stern-looking gunslingers. The track ends here. More than money, your sailors have lost morale.","802587":"Wait on the town's balconies, ready for an ambush","802588":"Wait at the saloon, ready for a fight","802589":"<b>A clean job.</b> As soon as the thieves come into sight, your sailors stealthily lay their firearms on the guardrails of the balconies, aiming and firing in rapid succession. The shots resonate through the quiet town: one shot, one permanent sleeper. When the sound and smell of the gunshots settles down, the sheriff salutes your crew's help in getting rid of the local pests, and ensures your sailors that their reputation will be made well known throughout the West.","802590":"<b>Rout.</b> Your sailors fire as soon as the gang comes into view, taking little time to aim and even less to observe their targets. The bullets graze past the thieves and upset their horses, who rear and jump before running away, along with their riders. A night drizzle starts falling, and soon drowns the bandits' tracks. Ambitious yet inefficient, that's as far as the crew's efforts can go.","802591":"<b>Honour and wages are retrieved.</b>When the gang slams the saloon's doors open, the place is devoid of its usual chirpy atmosphere. Moonbeams disclose the presence of your crew, sat on every possible chair, table and stair step, and already reaching for their guns. The fight is brief. Your sailors overwhelm the thieves and drag them outside, bound and gagged. They pause to salute the sheriff for his help, before heading back to the ship with the satisfaction of a job well done.","802592":"<b>Your crew are no match for the criminals.</b> When the gang barges into the saloon, the sailors are still arguing over how to handle the fight in such a closed space. The battle is short-lived. Your sailors lack the rough training and ability of their opponents, and can barely fling insults at them, even less punches. The roughed-up crew is thrown outside, and scampers away from the town - very aware of how lucky they are to still be alive.","802593":"<b>So much effort for such a meagre reward.</b> Feeling the pressure of unseen stares, your crew avoids the shady town and backs away to the harbour city and their ship. Better to decide on your own to withdraw than to be forced to, the sailors tell themselves. Frustration nibbles their thoughts as they set sail.","802594":"You can choose either to rent, or buy a mount","802595":"Confirm","802596":"Cancel","802597":"<b>The horses catch up with your prey in no time!</b> In a flurry of dust and whinnying, the mounts assail the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves, perched atop horses that are already exhausted from their mishandling. Your riders surround them, and the menace of your superior numbers, and your drawn pistols, hushes any resistance. The sailors, both satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot, and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.","802598":"<b>Your crew will make do on its own.</b> The price of the withered mares reeks of a scam, and your sailors refuse to pay a single pound for the animals. Their observations might be influenced by the light weight of their purses.","802599":"<b>A safe passage!</b> The raft is basic but sturdy, and it crosses the river without losing so much as a plank. The crew board the opposite bank safely, and climb the hill that rises beyond it. On the other side, they happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew need horses.","802600":"<b>The raft can't even float.</b> Your sailors bind logs and dead branches together with sturdy knots, but with little actual knowledge of how to assemble a raft. The raft's apparent stability tricks the builders into climbing on to it, and it swirls over the river, wobbling under the weight of sailors and the pressure of the current, before breaking and diving straight into the icy waters below. Few sailors can be rescued from the wreckage.","802601":"Keep searching","802602":"Stop these futile efforts","802603":"<b>Finally, tracks to follow!</b> Amidst the numerous footprints left by your sailors, your best huntsmen manage to find the dotted lines left in the dust by the fleeing thieves. There's no mistaking the bent pattern of their limping leader. The prints waddle to the nearest river, where they fade into the water.","802604":"<b>Isn't this humiliation enough?</b> Your crew keeps foraging through the outskirts of the town, but they still cannot find any tracks.","802605":"<b>Your purser protests, but the decision is final.</b> Going after the thieves, in a territory they seem to know by heart, while the crew itself is in foreign territory? It's a risk you're not willing to take. As the ship sails away from the harbour and the villains it hosts, your sailors mourn the plundered funds.","802606":"<b>Your purser protests, but the decision is final.</b> Going after the thieves, in a territory they seem to know by heart, while the crew itself is in foreign territory?

Forget what initial goal you had in mind - getting off the snow-topped peak is the only priority now.","802611":"Traverse the mountain on your own","802612":"Retrace your tracks","802613":"<b>Your navigators make do without a guide.</b> They take note of landmarks as they progress, relying on their compasses to follow a single direction, staying put during the night despite their dwindling supplies. At long last, they find a stream of melted snow, and follow it downhill to the foot of the mountain. The crew survived, but it was a tough effort.","802614":"<b>A guide would have been helpful.</b> Your sailors navigate the mountain paths to the best of their ability, but they aren't skilled enough for the task at hand. The narrow roads disappear beneath the mist of the snow and branch out around the skeletal trees, forcing your crew to spread out. When the explorers reach a decent camping ground and count their numbers, five of them are missing.","802618":"Go forward, leaving marks for the lost sailors to follow","802619":"Go back and look for the missing sailors","802620":"<b>The foot of the mountain, at last.</b> The crew progress step by step, testing the frozen snow for gaps while leaving piles of stones for the lost sailors to follow. Building the landmarks takes time, but it helps avoid any backtracking. The main group is soon joined by the missing sailors, who are disgruntled at having been left behind, despite the crew's best efforts to guide them. Soon their ordeal is over, however, as they reach the end of the mountain range in silence, left speechless with relief.","802621":"<b>The explorers get more lost with each passing day.</b> They venture deep into the mountain and quickly abandon the idea of leaving marks for the lost sailors, too concerned for their own survival. The frost solidifies their clothes, steals their toes and rots their food.","802622":"Follow a stream of melted snow running downhill","802623":"Force your way through the mounds of powder snow","802624":"Prioritise your supplies and look for food","802625":"<b>Your sailors manage to follow the stream to the foot of the mountain.</b> The stream flows in and out of the frozen ground, playing hide and seek with the desperate crew. They are not the only ones using the trickle as a guide: just before reaching the plains below the mountain, they meet with the missing sailors, who are quenching their burning thirst in the meagre snow stream. It's unclear which of the two teams is the most pitiful, but all are alive.","802626":"<b>Where did they come from? Where should they go?</b> The melting snow splits into a web of entangled streams, which buries under the ground and resurfaces without any apparent logic. The crew are taken by the illusion that the forest around them is flat, and can no longer tell if they are climbing or descending. They split like the streams themselves, to each sailor their trickle - but like the streams, not all of them find the foot of the mountain.","802627":"<b>The sailors draw strength from their last resources.</b> They ignore the colossal distance they have to cross, and focus on small milestones instead. Two steps to that tree. Three steps to that rock. The snow parts as they advance, drawing dark trenches which run across the pure white mantle, and which eventually - finally - reach the foot of the mountain. The crew stumble and fall in relief when they realise they made it out alive.","802628":"<b>The sailors are too weakened by the cold.</b> They dig through the powder snow, only for it to collapse in again without revealing any safe path. Their endurance crippled by the frost, they abandon the task and try to focus on less demanding options.","802629":"<b>The crew extend their stay in the cold to gather supplies.</b> Game is scarce, and hunting takes time. However, the food makes for a decent meal, and the smell of roasted hare fills the sailors' stomachs almost as well as the meat itself. The light from the fire spreads through the forest at night, and beckons the missing sailors. Reunited, the crew avoid talking about abandoning their companions, and they leave the mountain in silence.","802630":"<b>Your hunters fall prey to the mountain.</b> Animals' tracks sprinkle the fresh snow, but their owners are invisible, hidden in holes and burrows. The hunters are unused to such terrain. As they progress through the forest, discussing where snares could be most efficient, the frozen ground suddenly breaks beneath them, and a handful of sailors fall into a deep fault.","802631":"<b>The missing sailors are found, and with them an exit.</b> The idea of losing their companions pushes the hunters to persevere. Broken twigs, brushed moss, mud splashes: everything is a hint. They follow the trail to a crossing and find the lost sailors, who welcome them heartily: better yet, they've found a beaten path which leads straight to the foot of the mountain! That they believed in the others and waited for them is a reward in and of itself.","802632":"<b>The fresh snow hides the dangers underneath.</b> A powdery white frosting covers everything in sight, and the skies melt into the ground, disguising the horizon. The hunters advance on instinct alone, unable to spot any hints of their previous passage. They find the missing sailors only by encountering the same fate: the frozen ground breaks under their weight. The thin crust of ice hid a fault! Three of the lost men are down there - and two hunters just joined them.","802633":"Pull the sailors from the fault, at the risk of falling","802634":"Abandon them and continue downhill","802637":"<b>The rescue comes at the price of their remaining strength.</b> It takes ten sailors to get one man out of the fault: three to pull, six to hold and one to keep an eye on the trembling layer of ice. The snow weighs them down, pushing when they pull, hissing when they call out. When the last sailor is hauled from the rift, both the rescuers and rescued are broken. They drag themselves downhill. and manage to leave the clutch of the mountain.","802638":"<b>The ordeal is much bigger than your sailors.</b> They launch ropes into the rift, but the slippery walls of ice cannot be climbed. The rescuers attempt to haul the others up, and they plant their feet into the ground, pulling, heaving and panting, their physical reserves long drained by the cold. As they fall to their knees and break their nails on the frozen hemp, the rift cracks, and the mountain opens its mouth wide. The crewmates it swallows are never seen again.","802639":"<b>Salvation at the price of their humanity.</b> Ignoring the begging screams of their companions, the sailors make a large detour to avoid falling into the frozen rift. As they find a beaten path heading downhill, a sailor catches up to the group, panting: he admits to having thrown some pickaxes and ropes down the fault. The crew congratulate him for his selflessness, and pretend his good deed is enough to ease their conscience.","802640":"<b>The path is easy to recognize, but it is tortuous and unforgiving.</b> The crew fight against the elements, hurrying through the mountain passages with haste, lest their tracks disappear and leave them without hints to follow. When they finally escape the mountain range, they cannot remember how many nights they spent walking, and how many days they spent starving.","802642":"Blood, Oil, Sweat and Tears","802643":"<b>An overweight ship is easy prey for stormy waves.</b> The oil merchants your crew met at the last harbour paid good money for their cargo to be stored aboard your ship, but the weight isn't really something your vessel can handle. At the first signs of tempest winds and cutting waves, the unusual ballast makes your ship heel furiously.","802644":"Release the stern anchor","802645":"Improvise a sea anchor on the surface of the water","802646":"<b>Safe.</b> The cast-iron shank of the anchor plunges into the shifting waves with a large splash, the amount of chain being just right for it to take a good hold of the seabed. The ship wobbles, washed by the winds and the waves, but manages to stay put. The sailors simply wait for the storm to pass, and hope the extra load will not cause any more problems.","802647":"<b>A miss - the crew should go hide in the lower decks.</b> The anchor is released, its chain unravelling by itself more than it is controlled, and the large iron cross reaches the bottom with too much play to properly grip the sea floor. As it becomes apparent the anchor won't be of any help, the lieutenants order the crew to descend to the bottom decks of the swinging ship - but the oil merchants refuse to leave the apparent safety of their upper cabins.","802648":"Take the time to present this solution as the best","802649":"Drug them to avoid losing any more time","802650":"<b>The lost time was necessary.</b> Your lieutenants carefully convince the merchants, detailing all available options one by one, despite the increasingly high pressure from the waves, and the rocking of the ship. Their stoicism more than their arguments convinces the merchants to follow the orders, and they join the rest of the crew on the lower deck until the storm comes to pass.","802651":"<b>A waste of time.</b>Pressed by the urgency of the situation and unable to get their thoughts in order, your lieutenants cannot properly convince the merchants. As they begin to lose their nerve, the ship swerves and slams into the shore. Whistling winds invade the perforated hull, and water seeps in its wake.","802652":"Repair the hole while the water is still pouring","802653":"Move the ballast to lift the hole above sea level","802654":"<b>Your crew are used to making repairs in poor conditions.</b> Ignoring the swinging floor, the sailors focus on the hull, their legs deep in the pouring water. Drenched supplies lap around their legs as they fight to plug the hole. The seal will not last long, but it should hold until the next harbour.","802655":"<b>Your crew's speed cannot match the water's.</b> Overwhelmed by the current, and unable to prioritise their tasks or even shape a plan for the repairs, the sailors quickly abandon the idea of patching up the hull. They flee to the upper deck, and brace themselves as the ship crashes on the shore. The repairs take weeks.","802656":"<b>The forced instability protects the ship.</b> Your sailors huff and puff as they push the large sacks of basalt stones across the belly of the ship, progressively tipping the vessel's balance until its pierced flank leans away from the water. The ship is carefully led to the shore, where the crew can finally start repairs.","802657":"<b>A ludicrous plan.</b> Your sailors wheeze and gasp as they try to pull the basalt sacks, but their efforts are not enough to make the ballast budge. The ship remains level, allowing more and more water in, as it sinks under the intrusion. Several sailors drown, trapped between the deck's roof and the swirling currents, and their bodies cannot be evacuated before the storm calms down.","802658":"<b>Safe and drunk.</b> The merchants accept the liquid courage and drink its laced contents, falling asleep before they can finish their bottle. They're dragged to the lower deck along with the rest of the crew and whatever supplies the sailors could carry, their combined weight counterbalancing the pounding of the waves. The storm soon calms down, leaving the crew to deal with the hangover of their passengers.","802659":"<b>Too weak.</b> The drinks your sailors offer the merchants in an attempt to soothe their anger are far too poorly made to have any kind of impact on them. As they continue to struggle against your crew, a vivid growl resonates through the ship. You came too close to shore, and the reefs have pierced your hull! Water starts to pour into the lower decks.","802660":"<b>The sea anchor works as intended.</b> Your sailors quickly cable up a weighty assemblage, and after fastening it securely, let it drop into the waves. It pulls against the water to increase the ship's drag, gaining it enough stability to keep its broadside away from the waves. The crew, relieved, can wait for the storm to pass.","802661":"<b>The sea anchor sinks as soon as it touches the water.</b> The sailors tack together some extra sails to try and assemble a sea anchor, but the ballooning cloths snap as soon as they're thrown into the waves. As the ship is pushed towards the shore, the backwash gets more and more ample, until a rogue wave of ludicrous proportions rises above the sea. The merchant passengers beg your crew to save them!","802662":"Face the wave head on","802664":"Throw the oil cargo overboard to calm the seas","802665":"<b>Fearless.</b> Despite the battering gale and clobbering currents, your crew manage to keep the ship straight, as you face the rogue wave head on. The wave crashes into your vessel with all its rage and natural power, but the straight bow cuts its fury in two, and the ship avoids most of the damage - a rock among the waters. When the storm calms down, your crew focus on the repairs, and consider how exceptional their survival was.","802666":"<b>Too audacious.</b> The gusts of wind fill your sails, and the frantic currents pull at your hull. Your crew are far too untrained to keep control over the ship. Entailed by the sea's passion, the ship leaps and falls, dancing until the shore catches it and stops its mad waltz. The vessel's carcass finally remains still, as water and bodies flow from its bent silhouette.","802669":"<b>The water's anger dies out!</b> Moving the merchants aside with ease and dismissing their plea, your sailors heave the oil barrels over the railings, and let their contents spill around the ship. The oil hugs the water and rolls over the waves, dissolving the wind's grip, and slowing the water's movement. The threat of the waves is no more, but the merchants' trust and cargo were lost in the process.","802670":"<b>Their greed overcomes your strength.</b> The sailors first try to reason, and then try to force the merchants into giving up their precious oil, but your crew are weak in both body and spirit, while the merchants built their fortunes on hard-headedness. Long after the ship has been hit, crushed, and stranded, the merchants's cadavers are found lying on the shore's pebbles, still clutching their barrels of cargo.","802672":"The Fugitive","802673":"<b>Local authorities come aboard looking for the fugitive you've taken in.</b> A man in rags offered you his services in a port, saying he'd do any odd job for some food and the chance to join your crew. The captain agreed to take him on. He soon grew on your sailors, working hard and filling in wherever needed. But above all he has proved a man of principle — a champion of the vulnerable — and as such, the crew have learned to respect his silence on the matter of his past.","802675":"Pretend you haven't seen him","802676":"They'll have to fight you for him","802677":"Offer to pay the fugitive's bail","802678":"Hand over the fugitive","802679":"<b>Your crew stick stoically to the same story.</b> \"This man,\" the officials say, holding up a picture of their new friend, \"have you seen him?\" \"Oh no, no,\" your sailors reply. Still, the officials conduct a cursory search, but the man of many talents has no difficulty in hiding from them. When they've gone, there is a hearty cheer. \"Glad to have you with us!\" bellows the captain. You have a new recruit!","802680":"<b>Your attempt at deception fails.</b> The officer in charge lies that your ship has never docked at the port in question, yet the officials present a logbook stating conclusively that it did. This only serves to further rouse suspicion that he is somewhere on board.","802681":"Quickly, hide him!","802682":"Threaten to destroy their ship","802683":"<b>Hidden in plain sight!</b> Sensing how thorough the inspection is going to be, there's only one possible bolthole for your runaway. \"Get in the lifeboat, and keep your head down,\" the crewman whispers, while his pursuers are being detained on some pretence in the captain's cabin. To complete the plan, the lifeboat is then winched above the eyeline, where sure enough, the authorities never think to look. Not wanting to cause further trouble, he insists on leaving at the next port.","802684":"<b>\"There he is! Seize him!\"</b> The fugitive is still trying to make himself comfortable among a pyramid of barrels when his pursuers appear. They tackle him and clap him in chains.","802685":"Don't let them take him","802686":"Let them take him","802687":"<b>They don't give in easily.</b> Your sailors wait until the officials pass them by before knocking them to the floor, and confiscating their weapons. A shrill whistle sounds from the other ship, and armed men in smart navy uniforms pour up the boarding plank onto your deck. There follows a heavy skirmish, but your sailors gain the upper hand. The authorities surrender and retreat. Though grateful, your fugitive wishes to avoid causing further injury by his presence, and insists on leaving at the next port.","802688":"<b>The fugitive dies,</b> along with his pursuers. When your men try to lay hands on the port officials, they put a pistol to the fugitive's head. \"Try to stop us, and he gets it,\" they say. When your men try to be clever, they blow the fugitive's head off, then do the same to one of your men, before they themselves can be subdued. The dead prisoner was very popular aboard ship, and your crew wonder if things could possibly have turned out worse.","802689":"<b>Your crew offer no resistance.</b> They part before the two officials as they frogmarch the fugitive over the gangplank to their vessel. He tries to express his thanks to your crew for their efforts, but the official growls \"no more of your activism\", and slaps him sharply across the chops. The prisoner was very popular aboard your ship, and your crew believe more should have been done to defend him.","802690":"<b>Your threat is impressive indeed.</b> Rows of dark, iron mouths poke from their hatches, ready to fire at point blank range! \"You must be mad!\" says one official, as they skip back across the gangplank to their own ship, suddenly most anxious to leave! Your fugitive is thankful, but does not wish to endanger your expedition further, and waves a warm goodbye at the next port.","802691":"<b>Your men hesitate at the order,</b> because they can see the neighbouring ship is not one to be trifled with. Eyeing your sailors as they not-so-secretly prepare for battle, one of the officials sounds his shrill whistle, and a troop of navy-uniformed soldiers rush up from below deck. They fully intend to board you.","802692":"Fight them!","802693":"Let them board ship and take the man","802694":"<b>They don't give in easily.</b> A second shrill whistle sounds from the other ship, and the navy-uniformed brigade pour up the boarding plank and onto your deck, where your men sit ready for them. There follows a heavy skirmish. Some are injured, but your forces prevail. The authorities surrender and depart. Though grateful, your fugitive wishes to avoid causing further injury by his presence, and insists on alighting at the next port.","802695":"<b>There's no time.</b> Your men, still concerned with preparing for the sea battle, are thrown into disarray. \"To deck, men! To deck!\" is the cry, as they dive for their guns and rush to the deck, only to be cut down, one-by-one by the men in blue. \"Fools!\" smirks the official, as the fugitive is trussed in chains, \"To think so many died for this worthless streak of spittle... Take him away!\"","802696":"<b>You have a new recruit!</b> \"You're welcome to him!\" says the more senior of the two officials brightly, \"We had no idea he was so important to you.\" His colleague glances at him nervously, before wrinkling up a fake smile of his own. It's obvious they only chose to call off their pursuit because your vessel is far more powerful than theirs. With your ship free to continue, the former fugitive raises a glass. \"Thank you all,\" he says, \"here's to a triumphant expedition, and beyond!\"","802697":"<b>The officials seem undaunted.</b> \"Oh, I think we have little to fear from a ship as ill-equipped yours. Still, from your hostility, it's clear you're hiding the man we seek.\" They signal back to their own vessel to ready arms. <b>\"Now... think carefully. Do you really want to refuse to give him up?\"</b>","802698":"Demonstrate your firepower!","802699":"Surrender the fugitive to them","802700":"<b>It's a point blank exchange,</b> in which your ship manages to get the first shot, disabling half the men opposite. As such, the return fire is not so crippling as it might have been— although significant repairs will still be needed. As the two ships drift apart, the officials are left in helpless, comic isolation on your ship's deck. Someone gives them a good old shove overboard, forcing the other ship to return to rescue them. Your crew make their escape. \"I will burden you no further,\" says the fugitive wearily, \"please, allow me to alight at the next opportunity.\"","802701":"<b>It only serves to demonstrate your crew's incompetence,</b> because they are still not ready! The vessel belonging to the local authority fires first — and at such close range, the effect is devastating. Half your gunners lie maimed, and your ship is shredded through. You wave the white flag. The fugitive leaves with the officials of his own free will — after all, he has better chances of survival almost anywhere else!","802702":"<b>Your crew offer no resistance.</b> They part before the two officials as they frogmarch the fugitive over the gangplank to their vessel. He tries to express his thanks to your crew for their efforts, but the official growls \"no more of your activism\", and slaps him sharply across the chops. The prisoner was very popular aboard your ship, and your crew believe more should have been done to defend him.","802703":"The fugitive wears a look of stoic resignation, as his terms of release are discussed.","802704":"Confirm","802705":"Cancel","802706":"<b>You have a new recruit!</b> \"I will repay your trust in me tenfold!\" says the talented fellow, as the local authority departs with their payment. He raises a beaker of navy rum, \"Thank you all! Here's to a triumphant expedition, and beyond!\"","802707":"<b>You can't afford him.</b> Seeing that your men are still reluctant to let the fugitive go, the order is given to lower the footbridges, and a troop of navy-uniformed soldiers file into line, ready to board your ship.","802708":"<b>The fugitive does not resist.</b> With a look of stoic resignation, the man offers the officials his hands to be shackled. He turns back one last time before he goes, to say \"Thank you for everything,\" — dignified until the very last. The crew shall miss his company greatly.","802710":"Message In A Bottle","802711":"<b>Castaways request your help, but where could they be?</b> Shark-baiting is a common distraction for your sailors, but their latest catch provided much more entertainment than expected. In its belly was a bottle, and in the bottle were three sheets of paper, each a copy of the same message in different languages. Piecing together the documents to make up for their weathered content, the crew can make out a call for help and a latitude, but nothing more.","802712":"Examine the entrails of the shark for clues","802713":"Map the islands matching the partial coordinates","802714":"There's no time to spare for such things","802715":"<b>The stomach of the shark reveals its travels.</b> Glittering corals, exotic scales, and characteristic fish bones - your doctors finish their inspection of the shark's entrails and confirm your destination: to the Southern coral barriers! When the ship reaches the correct latitude, several islands litter the horizon. The crew hesitates to come any closer. The water is shallower than usual, and filled with sharp coral reefs.","802718":"Navigate closer to the islands and their reefs","802719":"Stay away and have the look-out search for castaways","802720":"<b>Your ship avoids the deadly reefs and finds the castaways!</b> The vessel groans as it swims through the clear waters, the deepest corals reflecting its shadow as it narrowly avoids them. It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach, sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty, and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.","802721":"<b>The ship cannot pass the underwater barrier.</b> Despite your navigator's efforts, the ship bumps against the coral reef - the manoeuvre is too complex and too risky for her. The crew are forced to turn their backs on the paradisiacal islands. Whether the castaways were real, and whether they were indeed stranded here, they will never know.","802722":"<b>Found them!</b> Your look-out shows their brilliance when they spot the thin smoke line of a campfire in the distance. A dinghy is sent to retrieve the castaways, and comes back filled to the brim with men with overgrown beards, torn clothes, and awed expressions. Their captain pledges himself to your crew. Once shaved and washed, the castaways prove themselves to be excellent sailors - and even better companions.","802723":"<b>The look-out draws a blank.</b> Scanning the islands from afar is a difficult exercise, made even harder by the lack of experience. The crew soon realises that it will never find anyone from such a distance. Reluctant to risk the ship's integrity over the mere possibility of the castaways' existence, your sailors choose to leave and forget.","802724":"<b>The homemade autopsy is a mess.</b> The shark's entrails are cut along with their contents, and spilled over the deck is a nauseous mass of gore and artefacts of unknown origin. The doctor cannot make sense of the anarchy he's created.","802725":"Interpret the patterns in the shark's entrails","802726":"Divination? Let's just stop now","802727":"<b>Relentless faith guides the most deserving.</b> In the spilled guts of the shark, your navigators see the shapes of islands, your doctors see the patterns of life forms, and your boatswain sees the promise of rewards. Driven by an inner force beyond simple greed, the crew sails past coral reefs and insidious currents, and finds the island on which the castaways had been waiting for rescue. Their relief is glorious, and their captain promises to serve your crew!","802728":"<b>There is nothing to find but deceit.</b> Your cooper burns some sage among the remains of the shark, and sniffs the lumpy smoke. If forces do talk to him, they might have been beyond what he could handle: he suddenly pounces on the closest sailor, crushing her throat between his hands. Three more fall before his frenzy drives him overboard with an otherworldly scream. The castaways are cursed, and the sailors mourn their comrades for the rest of the trip.","802729":"<b>Shark, bottle and messages are thrown overboard.</b> Several sailors protest against the rash decision - they'd have preferred to exhaust all options before giving up, or at least kept the messages to share them at the next harbour. The imagined blame and grief of the castaways haunts them for a while.","802730":"<b>The search defines a specific area.</b> Many islands match the latitude, but far fewer could be mapped on an actual shipping route. By deducing where the castaways' ship might have gone, your navigators identify a handful of islands which could host the castaways. After two weeks of smooth sailing, your ship reaches the area: a necklace of islands linked by strands of deadly coral reef.","802731":"<b>Your navigator is overwhelmed by the mass of possibilities.</b> Unable to agree on a proper searching method, yet alone define a list of reasonable possibilities, they abandon their task and admit the crew might as well try to work out the contents of the entrails. It's said as a joke, however, some sailors consider the idea.","802732":"<b>The bottle and its messages are thrown back into the sea.</b> The crew's regrets drift away with the bottle, and the castaways are soon forgotten.","802734":"The Mad Preacher","802735":"<b>Your chaplain is going overboard with his preaching.</b> Blaming the expedition's mishaps and misfortunes on the supposed heresy of the ship's officers, the man of faith manages to rouse the gradual distrust and anger of the sailors. His preaching is now part of the crew's daily routine. His words find an echo in the mouths of the sailors, and your lieutenants can see their authority slipping away.","802736":"Demonstrate that his doubts are fuelled by a mental illness","802737":"Discredit him in a direct confrontation","802738":"Simply punish him, without taking measures against his ideas","802739":"<b>The man of faith belongs in an asylum.</b> Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon and accuses him of megalomania, listing the traits of the madness: desire for attention, a craving for control, and an overwhelming urge to rouse the paranoia of others in order to match one's own. The portrait is a perfect depiction of the chaplain, and, despite their former affection for the man, the sailors agree that he should be sedated with laudanum for the rest of the trip.","802740":"<b>The doctor only proves his own paranoia.</b> Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon with a loud declaration, stating that the man of faith is, in fact, a soul tormented by a mental illness. With all eyes on him, your doctor utters a list of personal opinions rather than medical facts, and the chaplain welcomes his doubts with benevolence. His influence flourishes, and your lieutenants have to make do with him for the rest of the trip.","802741":"<b>Your diplomat has a greater way with words.</b> She silently enters the lower deck during the chaplain's daily preaching, and waits in a corner of a room. When the man of faith finally loses his nerve and asks her what she wants, she lists two hours worth of the chaplain's arguments and, without pause, offers counterpoints for each of them. The humiliation is magnificent, and the chaplain's babbling defence convinces the crew of his puerility. They lose interest.","802742":"<b>Your diplomat was not ready to face the chaplain.</b> She confronts the preacher before the crew, and flaunts her interpretation of the chaplain's mistakes, stating how wrong he is without taking into account the weeks of argument he'd built with his followers. Her diatribe convinces none but herself, and the chaplain simply remarks that her anger is proof of his being right. Your lieutenants have to make do with his whims for the rest of the trip.","802743":"<b>Not the most diplomatic solution, but it works.</b> Trusted sailors interrupt the chaplain during his daily preaching and drag him to the upper deck, where your first mate welcomes the man of faith with a devoted flogging. The display of violence mostly proves the preacher's point, but the menace of the officers' ire is greater than the crew's distrust in them. The trip resumes in a climate of tension.","802745":"Jolly Roger","802746":"<b>Pirates!</b> The torn black flag bearing a skull and crossbones is a shock to those on your expedition who thought they were a dying breed. The weather-worn ship emerges from the mist with prepared to plunder. Astride her bow stands her colourful captain, axe raised; along her rails, the spectral silhouette of her starving crew, hungry to feed.","802747":"Manoeuvre into attack position","802748":"Have an officer make a rousing speech","802749":"<b>You swivel on a sixpence, ready to blow them away!</b> Quickly setting sails to curb momentum, your ship turns in the shallowest possible arc for a vessel this size — a manoeuvre only a tactician well-accustomed to risk would attempt. Meanwhile, some of the crew have improvised a few grenades, should you want to make use of them...","802750":"<b>The turn is not sharp enough.</b> There was nothing wrong with the idea, but whatever tactical advantage your ship may have had is lost with the rather cautious turning circle it plots, out of which the ship emerges a slow-moving target. ","802751":"Fire the cannons!","802752":"Bombard them with handmade grenades!","802753":"<b>The pirates are sunk</b> before they have chance to do any damage at all! Your ship's guns target the most mould-ridden flank of the corsairs' ship, smashing it through. The antique vessel collapses in on itself, and your sailors enjoy the resulting plunder almost as if they themselves had been the pesky picaroons.","802754":"<b>It's a disappointing salvo.</b> Despite being in a strong position, your cannons are miscalibrated, and end up firing short. The pirates know they cannot win this with their outmoded gunnery, and between shots they draw in close, latching onto your ship with their boarding hooks. ","802755":"Defend against the boarding pirates","802756":"Surrender to them","802757":"<b>Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.</b> The rowdy band charge aboard only to find your resolute crew arranged in a classical shield wall, with percussion cap pistols poking out of what few gaps remain. Although your crew sustain fairly gruesome injuries from pirate axes, all but one survive. That young lad is given a funeral, unlike the poor dead pirates.","802758":"<b>You're lucky they don't leave with your ship!</b> Some of your sailors are equipped with old flintlocks, whose inaccuracy permits the enemy to engage at close quarters. The swordplay proceeds so terribly on your side that a section of pirates are able to reach the lower deck, and pilfer all they find. Satisfied, their captain bays \"fall back!\" and the scourge are gone, leaving your crew to count the dead.","802759":"<b>\"Take all you want, but please, don't hurt us!\"</b> your officer pleads. The pirate captain grins, revealing a jumbled set of shark teeth, before proceeding to strip the chap of his ear. \"Sounds fair,\" he says, still smiling. Your ship is then relieved of its supplies without further violence; the pirates no doubt bound by some arcane code to honour your surrender. You wonder if your expedition can survive on what the little they leave behind.","802760":"<b>The pirates weren't expecting such a crafty attack.</b> \"I was saving these for a special occasion,\" your weaponsmith burps. The 'special brew' he's concocted consists of a bottle filled with powder, a hemp fuse, and a nail surprise. There's a shimmering sound as they explode, and when the smoke clears, your crew frisk the punctured bodies littering the deck, singing \"Rollicking band of pirates, we!\"","802761":"<b>Ineffective to say the least.</b> The improvised grenades are duff fireworks, and when landing on the pirate deck, they fail to discharge. There is no time to apportion blame, for the tide of battle has swung again in favour of the pirates, who have hooked the two ships together for boarding.","802762":"Position for attack anyway","802763":"Surrender","802764":"<b>You make the best of a poor position.</b> At the last moment, your maverick navigators cut inside the approaching pirates, who had been hoping to board you. Your crew have the breathing space now to act!","802765":"<b>The navigators fail to recover</b> from the initial setback. Your helmsman has no tricks left up his sleeves, and cannot pick up speed to outrun the approaching pirates. They intend to board you!","802766":"Fire all cannons!","802767":"Board them!","802768":"<b>After a long exchange, the pirates are sunk!</b> Damage is done to both ships, before finally your men \"cross the T\" by releasing a full broadside into their prow. Immediately, the enemy ship is guzzling water. Any plunder floating above the wreck can serve as compensation for the minor damage you've received.","802769":"<b>It is a damaging encounter.</b> The rotted exterior of the pirate vessel invites cannon fire, but their movements are too clever, never exposing their flanks to a broadside. Keen to corner them, your officers overcommit, and in doing so, leave themselves open to a devastating barrage. The pirates take the chance to flee — which is fortunate, because your ship is almost dead in the water.","802770":"<b>Your crew go beserk for the fight.</b> Most of the ramshackle pirate crew fall in the first bloodthirsty charge, while your raiders suffer only one or two casualties. While the pirates bleed out, your men deprive them of any ill-gotten plunder they have. You then scupper the barque, and watch as it disappears, black flags and all, to meet Davy Jones.","802771":"<b>Your crew don't seem too keen.</b> Perhaps they know they won't stand a chance going hand-to-hand with seasoned pirates. As the two ships adjoin, it's the pirates who make the charge. Almost immediately, a pirate swings an axe and lops off a head. Horrified, your steersman hurriedly spins your ship away, with fighters on both sides falling into the resulting chasm. Your depleted crew flees at full speed. ","802772":"Fight them to the death","802773":"Listen to reason and surrender","802774":"<b>It is a saddening scene.</b> To see this many brave fighters put to the sword is regrettable. Fortunately, the losses are largely on the other side; the pirates' antique weaponry ever more a disadvantage in the modern age. When the last scrawny dog is dead, you set their ship alight like a funeral barque. Your own sailors, still twitching from the skirmish, pour themselves long jars of rum, and remember the fallen. ","802775":"<b>You are no match for the pirates. </b> The attackers pour in like beetles from all sides, a many-legged brood washing over your forces like some unstoppable plague, crushing all resistance. \"I know it's a good'un, but we ain't taking the ship...\"  the pirate captain is heard to utter by a few survivors, who were cowering behind a locked door, \"...just everything on it!\" When the sound of looting and cheering has died away, the survivors emerge to find the expedition ship stripped of pretty well everything it had.","802776":"<b>Should have waved the white flag sooner.</b> Your weapons drop and the pirate captain saunters aboard. She is tall and surprisingly aged, dressed in the dashing clothes of a bygone era, \"For our trouble, we'll have some of yer crew for slaves,\" she growls, \"all of 'em left of this line.\" She swishes her cutlass and portions off several of your crew as her playthings. After that, she turns more amicable, as her horde loot your ship. As they leave, she drops a feathered glove to show her gratitude.","802777":"<b>\"Take all you want, but please, don't hurt us!\"</b> your officer pleads. The pirate captain grins, revealing a jumbled set of shark teeth, and proceeds to strip the chap of his ear. \"Sounds fair,\" he says, still smiling. Your ship is then relieved of its supplies without further violence; the pirates no doubt bound by some arcane code to honour your surrender. You wonder if your expedition can survive on what the little they leave behind.","802778":"<b>Your men are resolute following the speech.</b> Your acting lieutenant points his sabre to the sky, defying the heavens themselves. \"If I, born with gas lighting, heated water, and a silver spoon in mouth...\" with each fresh admission a cheer goes up, \"If I can enjoy chopping through these mangy pirates, then you lot will bloody well be in heaven!\" There is a raucous cheer as the men prepare for their orders. ","802779":"<b>There's neither spirit nor courage to be roused.</b> Your crew instead seem transfixed by the approaching spectre of doom. Even as the horde board, the defenders' minds seem elsewhere, hypnotised perhaps by the tall and angular captain with greying hair and a wizened visage, who stalks the deck juicing your sailors. Once the pirates have taken everything they desire, they leave just as mysteriously as they appeared. ","802780":"Board the pirate ship!","802781":"Fire all cannons!","802782":"<b>It is indeed a heroic charge.</b> Led by the acting lieutenant, your sailors hurtle down the boarding bridges and storm the pirate ship, leaving a mangled trail in their wake. The black flag is ripped from the mast, and the pirate's booty is plundered. Unexpectedly, however, your lieutenant then impishly permits the survivors to go free — \"Come now, be humble in thy victory! For how dull would the world be without these old pirate salts!\"","802783":"<b>Pirates are always ready for a skirmish!</b> Having delayed boarding until they were properly armed and ready, your men fail to make use of their conviction. On seeing the pirate planks fall first, your lieutenant backtracks, urging caution in the face of the oncoming horde!","802784":"Stay put and pick them off","802785":"Charge anyway!","802786":"<b>You only take a few losses</b> between reloads, when wild pirates set upon the soldiery with cutlasses and handaxes. Suddenly there is a cry from the pirate ship. The pirate captain has been hit! Clutching her chest, she is borne away below deck on the shoulders of her shipmates. The pirates immediately withdraw so that they may attend to their queen.","802787":"<b>The first round of rifle fire misses,</b> and there is no time to prepare a second before the horde are on top of your crew, binding the strongest first, and maiming those who resist. When the hurly-burly's over, the pirates prop your bound survivors against each other as they trawl the ship for goodies, before they wish you \"fair winds\" and depart, cackling with glee.","802788":"<b>Your men don't hesitate having come this far.</b> There is a din as the two packs collide, like rugby players, over the divide between the boats. Blood surges over the wooden boards, as men fall on both sides. Finally, the pirates are driven back, at which point they retract their boarding planks and raise their sails to the breeze, spinning away to prey on victims less chewy.","802789":"<b>Your men hesitate a second too long,</b> and the pirates have made up the distance between the ships. Now they've been allowed on board, they have the upper hand, and are soon on top of your crew, binding them and maiming those who resist. When the hurly-burly's done, the pirates prop your bound survivors against each other as they trawl the ship for goodies, before wishing you \"fair winds\" and departing, cackling with glee.","802790":"<b>The pirates are sunk</b> before they have a chance to do any damage at all! Your ship's guns target the most mould-ridden flank of the corsairs' ship, smashing it through.

Satisfied, their captain bays \"fall back!\" and the scourge are gone, leaving your crew to count the dead.","802799":"The Night In Jail","802800":"<b>Behind bars!</b> The prolonged stay of your ship in this harbour is not what you intended. Obscure laws were breached, and your whole crew has found themselves arrested under the pretence that the region's borders, whose nature remains unknown, were not respected. Heavily armed foreigners lead your crew through the sinuous roads of their city and into the local jail; after passing by a row of freshly hanged criminals, the sailors are locked up. Only two guards keep watch, their heads bobbing with fatigue. Are they underestimating your crew?","802801":"Poison the guards!","802802":"Dig an escape tunnel!","802803":"Prepare your defence for the upcoming trial","802804":"<b>Just two guards is not enough to contain your science.</b> The doctor brings out a sachet of vials and packets, and produces leathery pouches filled with white powders, some matte, some glittering like sugar. He mixes a bit of this one and a bit of that one, gauging measures with the eye of the seasoned practitioner, then calls to the guards. When the unsuspecting wardens are close enough, the doctor blows the mixture in their face. The men drop dead!","802805":"<b>The doctor showcases his ignorance.</b> He produces a pouch of arsenic before calling the guards. When the jailers are close enough, the doctor is ready to blow the powder in their face - however, his lack of knowledge of the poison's properties backfires. The soft inhalation of the doctor is enough to bring the highly volatile poison to his lips, and he leaps back, coughing and wheezing. The guards immediately understand this was attempted murder.","802806":"Disguise yourselves as guards and escort the rest of the crew","802807":"Avoid drawing any attention and sneak outside","802808":"<b>The escape is flawless.</b> Two of your sailors don the guards' uniforms and drag the rest of the chained crew through the prison. When they are stopped at the exit, they mimic the local accent, briefly explain the liberation, and kick one of the chained sailors for good measure. The legitimate wardens buy the lie! It takes an even greater effort to refrain from laughing before reaching the ship and leaving the port.","802809":"<b>An attempt way beyond their ability.</b> Two sailors put on the guards' uniforms and lead the crew through the prison, until some legitimate guards stop them and enquire about the strange cortège. The disguised men's fidgety attitude and suspiciously foreign accent is enough to convince the wardens to check their original cell: the guards' bodies are found, and with them comes the heavy charge of murder. The following day, the trial is held.","802812":"Offer to pay a fine, however high it might be","802813":"Plead that they were just following orders, and have the crew repudiate Her Majesty","802814":"The judges give your captain a stern look","802815":"Confirm","802816":"Cancel","802817":"<b>The price is high, but fair.</b> Most of the expedition's budget is squandered in the brutal fine, and though the crew are cleared of their charges, they find themselves forced to ration their supplies for the rest of the trip. The doctor and his accursed ideas are blamed, and the man is turned into a scapegoat: his rations are regularly stolen, damaging his health and abilities - and, worse, the crew blatantly avoid his treatments.","802818":"<b>Who would accept such a meager payment?</b> Murder is not a subject to be triffled with, and the foreign court makes its opinion clear: your crew will pay in the hardest way possible. To show they value life more than your sailors, the judges impose a non-lethal punishment, devising a program of forced labour and precise observation to ensure the sailors suffer as much as possible without dying. Months of hell follow before the crew can leave.","802819":"<b>That lie is believable, but it doesn't erase your crew's crimes.</b> The foreign judges put aside any idea of the death sentence, and focus instead on finding a punishment befitting the crime. The crew are arranged into a procession, and made to cross the city in chains while chanting the ill-will of their Queen. Their patriotism tainted, the sailors never dare to speak her name again.","802820":"<b>Who would believe such an obvious lie?</b> Why would their Queen ask for such a menial task as poisoning overseas guards? To match the crime, the crew's lieutenants are forced to drink hemlock solutions, before being trapped in a single cell with the rest of the crew. The lieutenants gag and wheeze for days in agony, their skin puffing and their muscles stiffening in impossible positions, until their breathing itself is locked into place. Only then are the sailors allowed to leave.","802821":"<b>The perfect crime!</b> Despite their numbers, your sailors manage to sneak through the prison and into the streets, where they become shadows under the moonless night. Led by your most competent hunters, they creep through the back alleys and back yards, until their obscurity returns them to their ship. Feeling like the protagonists of an adventure novel, and revelling in the sentiment, they leave the harbour in the gliding vessel - all lights off, and no sound made.","802822":"<b>They are caught!</b> Your sailors' lack of discretion is awkward, and it's only a matter of minutes before a patrol spots them. Without any prepared disguise or lie, they're instantly arrested - and worse, the bodies of the poisoned guards are found on the way back to their cell. The next morning, they're judged not just for their meager trespassing, but for actual murder.","802823":"<b>A nice display of craftsmanship.</b> The crew digs a tunnel with skill, taking care to reinforce the structure and analyse the soil's nature as they progress. They avoid the most friable sections of the city's ground and emerge on the coast, exactly as calculated. Your ship's not too far, but a frigate stands guard. However, its lights are off, and the guards onboard might be sleeping rather than actually keeping watch.","802825":"<b>A dead end.</b> The crew can handle basic digging, but their progress is reluctant, slowed by the constant fear of being buried in the makeshift tunnel. At the first obstacle they encounter - a large foundation pillar which blocks the way - the sailors hurriedly agree that there is nothing more that can be done with the tunnel. They return to their cell, relieved.","802826":"<b>Buried alive.</b> The sailors have but a vague idea of how to dig an escape tunnel. They grind the earth with their bare hands, the pungent soil getting stuck under their nails and lining their clothes, hair, skin. As air comes to lack, so too does their judgement, and the crew push forward, blind to the crumbling rock. The tunnel collapses in on them, and what few sailors were still outside are judged and released without sentence - the death of their companions is deemed punishment enough.","802827":"Stealthily sail away","802828":"Bombard the frigate as you leave","802829":"<b>Swift as a whisper.</b> Your sailors embark on the ship and deploy its sails in an excruciatingly slow manner, timing their flapping and clinking with the melody of the backwash. The vessel creaks softly and lets the sea take it, drifting away from the harbour with delicate movements of to and fro. Soon, the city is but a point on the horizon, and the sailors allow themselves to explode in a clamour of celebration.","802831":"<b>Ridiculously visible.</b> Your sailors tiptoe past the guarding frigate with their shadows stretching across the whole deck, their stressed whispers ringing through the night. As a testimony to their poor hunting skill, it takes a barrel in their cheeks for them to realize they have been spotted. The next morning, the judges' verdict takes into account the escape attempt and condemns half of your crew to a month of forced labour.","802832":"Offer to pay a fine instead","802833":"Force your crew into complying with the unreasonable demand","802834":"The judges give your captain a stern look","802835":"Confirm","802836":"Cancel","802837":"<b>Bribery is a reasonable option.</b> The payment offered satisfies the judges, who agree to let your sailors go. The crew mutter about the absurd trial and its even more absurd resolution, but their relief shows.","802838":"<b>Not enough.</b> The judges scoff at your attempt to bribe them with a so-called fine, and advise your crew to try a higher amount next time. To show they're not so cheap, they extend your crew's penalty to two months of forced labour, and place the sailors under the tightest surveillance. The two months are a mixture of menial and unrewarding tasks, and frequent and unwarranted whipping.","802839":"<b>The crew comply.</b> Following their superiors' orders, the sailors accept the judges' penalty and fulfil their obligations to the best of their abilities. One month of forced labour seems harsh, though, even for the local population, who supports the crew's effort and vouch for their liberation. The crew earn an early release, and are left tired but touched by the unexpected appreciation.","802840":"<b>The crew refuse to comply.</b> The insistence of your first mate cannot convince the sailors to sacrifice themselves for the good of the crew, and the heated debate that follows is cut short by the judges. If your crew cannot decide who to send into forced labour, all of them will go! Forced to submit, the crew invest their strength into one month of meaningless tasks and incessant bickering among themselves.","802841":"<b>An explosive escape!</b> The crew feels whole again aboard their ship, and they now have the tools to face their opponents. The loaded canons fire a volley of precise blasts at the foreign frigate and its harbour, setting the whole coast aflame. Your ship sails away with the blaze in its back, a vision of grandiose might which fills the sailors with pride.","802842":"<b>A failed attempt.</b> The sailors lack the skills required to load their cannons under the cover of night. Misguided movements and poor knowledge of the armament makes the canons overflow with powder. When they're fired, the weapons explode and take their gunner with them, offering a loud indication of the escapees' position. The crew are seized and sent back to their cell. At dawn, the judges sentence half the crew to a month of forced labour.","802844":"<b>An epic trial!</b> At their first chance to speak, your crew engage in an extensive and thrilling retelling of their adventures, captivating the audience and the judges. They climb and rock benches to mimic past naval battles, engage the public by asking them timely and suspenseful questions, and modify their tales according to the audience's whims. Their trespassing is made part of the story, and as they retell the trial itself, the judges insist on letting them go. They leave as heroes!","802849":"<b>Your defence doesn't move the judges.</b> The trial follows obscure local laws, and their meandering unravelling goes beyond what your diplomat is used to. Her words stumble upon the judges' traps, and her lack of understanding of the legal subtleties of the situation is obvious to anyone. To the dismay of your crew, the judges' verdict is harsh: one month of public labour for at least half of your sailors.","802851":"<b>Your diplomat is beyond awkward.</b> At the trial, she interrupts the judges to insist on meaningless details, pointing out not your crew's innocence, but rather the reasons why their guilt is, to quote her directly, \"not that bad\". Her lack of professionalism and conviction is irritating, and the judges interrupt the hearing with a hasty judgement just to stop her. Your crew are coerced into one full month of forced labour, a disproportionate and disheartening sentence.","802852":"The Iron Dragon","802853":"<b>Cornered by a fearsome Pyrphorian vessel!</b> Your expedition has reached South America at last, and the crew are looking forward to some well-earned rest. Night has fallen, and your ship is already in the tranquil bay when the look out screams \"behind us!\". There, looming in the darkness, gleams a dragon of iron, its nostrils livid with fire. \"It's the vessel that killed Mr. Goode! But this one must be twice as large! We are at their mercy!\" However, the bay is hidden from the bright gaze of the moon, and it is possible the dragon has not yet spotted you. If you choose to show yourself, you cannot expect to be a match for the dragon - only to somehow hinder it long enough to flee.","802854":"Fight your way out","802855":"<b>Your aim is true, but the dragon is gathering its hot breath.</b> To engage the hulking vessel is a humbling experience — the size, the power, the feet-thick armoured hull that your ordnance seems to only bounce limply off. The crew seem defeated, until they realise their precise fire at the dragon's stern, while showing no external sign of damage, appears to have caused a problem in the engine room. As a response, masked figures rush to prime the beastly mouth — a great cannon of fire! You must act quickly.","802856":"Maintain your fire on the weakened engine","802857":"<b>Your crew cheer the cannoneers,</b> and one good hit to the same spot does the trick! There are loud rasping noises before the ironclad's engines fall silent, and the great monstrosity drifts to a gentle halt. As your crew escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemy, and see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians always seem to be one step ahead, and are possessed of such fearful machinery. You set up camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, confident it will keep you well-hidden.","802858":"<b>Your aim isn't quite as good this time.</b> Your shots roll over the solid iron deck like balls of ivory on a bagatelle board, barely making a dent. The iron dragon's mouth yawns wide above your little boat, and from it, the first plume of fire melts the men at the taffrail. The two hulls are close enough for boarding, but there are just too many of the rogues.

The sailors stagger back to the ship, leaving two dead behind.","802921":"<b>A way in!</b> Following the glacier and identifying its contours by the bumps and gaps of its snow cape, your sailors find a spot of crunchy and brittle ice which covers the entrance of a steep slope leading into the crevasse. The wounded men lie at the bottom, doing their best to muffle their whimpers of pain.","802922":"<b>An alternate entrance is found after a long while.</b> Alternate is a euphemism: the sailors went deep into the entrails of the glacier, and instead of finding a way into the crevasse, they discerned a fault in the thin ice wall. Breaking it allowed them inside, but their delayed arrival, rather than soothing the fallen men, instead triggers their ire: couldn't they have come faster? Don't they see their freezing limbs? Don't they know the fright they caused?","802923":"<b>The glacier forbids your sailors from finding their way through it.</b> The twisting paths of the frozen structure are too much for the crew, who encountered enough trouble following the main marked glacier route. They're forced to abandon their quest, and must instead go back to the broken mantle and its crevasse.

They clench their teeth as they're pulled onto their companions' backs and carried up the tricky slope, helping their rescuers by balancing their movements and ignoring their gnawing pain. The morning greets them in a glorious scene of dumbfounded relief.","802931":"<b>It works, but at what cost?</b> The wounded are pulled more than they are carried, their rescuers lacking both the physical and mental strength required to treat the injured with the care and delicacy they need. When the last man is pulled from the slope, a gruesome noise announces that parts of him have decided to stay in the tunnel. The body is abandoned as the crew hurries back to the ship, disgruntled.","802932":"Alleviate their panic with drugs","802933":"Talk them into a calmer behaviour","802934":"<b>The groggy men are cooperating at last.</b> A just dosage of tranquillisers tones down their panic while keeping them conscious, and the wounded let themselves be guided out of the crevasse and back to the ship. When the drugs and the cold wear off, they realise how oblivious they were to the real extent of their injuries.","802935":"<b>Their artificial calm lasts eternally.</b> The dosage of tranquillisers is a bit on the nose, and doesn't even take into account the weakened state of the patients. Their panic calms down at an alarming speed, and their consciousness lapses, followed by a sleep so deep it takes away both their breath, and their heartbeat. At least they died peacefully.","802936":"<b>They calm down and can finally be rescued.</b> Your sailors are respectful of the wounded's pain and sympathise with them, soothing their angst with empathy and welcomed admiration. The injured stifle their insults and try to live to their companions' expectations, holding their whimpers until they're back on the ship. Their wounds are a nasty sight, but their pride is beaming.","802937":"<b>Their panic soars, pushing them to their death.</b> Your sailors try to motivate the wounded through accurate descriptions of their fate, pointing at their darkened limbs and prophesying their coming fall. The injured enter a state of pure terror, screaming continuously and unable to hear themselves, crawling away from the news bearers and deeper into the chasm, until the snow dampens their screams and the sound of their final fall.","802938":"Have the weakened sailors try to pull the others up","802939":"Put the wounded out of their misery before leaving","802940":"<b>Your sailors' best efforts cannot compensate for the loss of time.</b> The crew's physical ability is excellent, but the cold makes no exceptions when it comes to eating flesh. The wounded are pulled up, and the fangs of ice tear their feet and legs away, the crevasse keeping the trophies as fees for the men's freedom. They're brought back to the ship, but can never truly take part in the expedition again.","802941":"<b>A terrible initiative.</b> Several sailors slip into the crevasse, pushing and pulling the wounded up the frozen walls at the cost of what little energy they have. Their panting draws lines of mist around them, and their faint clouds of breath thicken, and thicken, and suddenly evaporate. There is no more saving to be done for the injured and their rescuers.","802942":"<b>Heartbreaking.</b> Could they have resolved this in any other way? Your sailors try to ignore the question while they point their guns at their companions, men too frozen now to realize what's about to happen. They die silently, and the absence of protest weighs heavier than any voiced reproach on the would-be rescuers.","802943":"<b>They had it coming.</b> This is not your crew's first encounter with the dangers of the wild, yet they persisted in being foolhardy and ignored the basic rules of mountain hiking.

Beyond the next bend are a set of <b>devious rapids</b> frothing down towards you, and with the Pyrphorian dragon fast approaching, time is in short supply.

Your captain is quick to praise the great skill of your navigator, rather than face the troubling possibility that the Pyrphorians know of a greater danger to come. <b>The river has taken you as far as it can,</b> and you must decide whether to continue across a marsh of uncertain depth, or as Ramón suggests, to head through a nearby network of caves.","802950":"Cautiously enter the marshes","802951":"<b>Your men know those aren't logs bobbing in the marsh,</b> and decide to wade well clear of the lurking black caiman, who from their chubby bellies appear to have had success in these waters.

The raging sail is swallowed by the storm, while the foremast collapses and crushes the starboard. In a final irony, the storm soon calms down, letting your crew see how a lack of meddling would have caused less damage.","803014":"<b>The stalactites are dealt with.</b> In a bold act of defiance towards logic and prudence, your artillery men fire their cannons to send precisely gauged vibrations throughout your ship. The foremast protests but resists, while the pikes of ice parasitising its sails break and rain on the deck in a cacophony of tingling sounds. Your maimed ship has but to wait for the blizzard to run out of breath now.","803015":"<b>Reckless, and proportionately paid.</b> Gauging the difference between power which might break the stalactites only, and power which might also break the mast is beyond the understanding of most humans, your artillery men included.

Ironically, the blizzard reacts by calming down, leaving the sailors to their broken ship.","803016":"Strengthen the mast with chains and planks","803017":"<b>Isabel's eyes flash with anger.</b> \"So!

Despite its movement, the construction is sturdy, and actually accompanies the masts as they move in the wind, giving them a welcome support. When the blizzard leaves, your ship is plucked naked, but its masts still stand.","803021":"<b>The trigger of catastrophy.</b> Your sailors tie planks and poles around the masts, pulling chains around them as tightly as they can, oblivious to the carpentry laws that apply to the movement of towering objects. The masts try to break free of their man-made prisons, and soon do, crashing onto the deck one after the other. As if chased by the hysteria below, the blizzard flees, lettings its sunrays fall on the barren carcass of your ship.","803022":"<b>Somehow, it works.</b> Your sailors take the time to slowly distil seawater in order to avoid improper condensation. The salt is acquired faster than anticipated, and spread over the base of the main mast, forcing the ice back to its liquid form. The blizzard keeps filling the sails until it runs out of breath and recedes, but the furious weather was enough to greatly maim the ship. There will be extensive repairs.","803023":"<b>There was no chance of success.</b> To gather salt, your sailors keep away from the wind and bury below the deck to light a fire under a pot of seawater. Their condenser is poorly handled, and causes the water to fall back into the pot, leaving the crew to believe the fire isn't burning hard enough. They fan the flames. Hell rises. The blizzard is fed gusts of murky smoke, and spits it back out before receding, revealing the half-burnt carcass of your ship.","803024":"<b>Prudence and faith pay off.</b> Your sailors huddle together in the lower deck, resisting the temptation to go check the masts and their frozen sails. Time trickles away as the storm recedes, and when the blizzard is no more than a light drizzle, the sun emerges to illuminate your ship. It's perfectly unscathed, and slowly drifts towards the coast, where a harbour is already in sight.","803025":"<b>Your sailors' feeble trust is not enough to fuel their patience.</b> The storm lingers, and with each new gust of raging wind the main mast complains and moans, until the distinct sounds of breaking wood resonate through the ship. That's enough waiting! Several sailors rush to the upper deck in the hope of either strengthening or defrosting the mast.","803026":"<b>Sails frozen, food rotten, and a ship on the brink of breaking.</b> It's a blizzard! All notion of time and direction has long been lost: a never-ending tempest of snow surrounds the ship, blurring the limits between night and day, or sky and sea. Stalactites have imprisoned your sails, binding them to the masts and making them creak under the unexpected weight. Your crew fear they might break, but should anyone venture outside while violent winds whip the upper deck?","803029":"The Breakout","803031":"Pay the outrageous fine","803032":"Try to break the prisoners out","803033":"Leave without the captive sailors","803034":"This is preposterous","803035":"Confirm","803036":"Cancel","803037":"<b>The fine is duly paid.</b> Of course, your crew boil as the militia counts the payment and divides it up between them, all while flapping without remorse about the noble old art of bribery. Yet your sailors take comfort that they have been allowed to leave safe and sound, and mark the harbour on the map with the noble intention of forewarning other seafarers of the ruse.","803038":"<b>No fine, no prisoners.</b> The militia make it clear: your crew members will not be freed unless their ludicrous demands are met.","803039":"<b>You secure an early release!</b> Your men return to the ship and wait for nightfall. At the sight of a signal flare, the prisoners anticipate your course of action and place a lit candle by the bars of each window. After careful calibration of the cannons, a second flare goes up signalling the imminent blast. The candles extinguish in acknowledgement before the ship's guns sound. The cliff wall of the fortress crumbles away! Taking their chances, the prisoners launch themselves into the water below, just as your ship passes by. Tales of the daring rescue will be going around for years.","803040":"<b>You make a mess of the fortress — and the poor people inside.</b> The cannon fire impacts the cliff, but your artillerymen have not taken enough care in their calculations. The fortress walls crumble easily enough, but the occupants of the cells are either killed in the blast, or plunge to their deaths on the rocks below. As your expedition makes a hasty exit, the crew try to come to terms with what they have done.","803041":"<b>\"I think that's the last we shall ever see of them,\"</b> lament the sailors that night, as the anchor is raised and the westerly breeze tears them away from the unforgiving fortress. As they depart, candles appear at the bars of each cell, signifying — in the imagination of your crew at least — a unanimous verdict of reproach. ","803042":"<b>Unfair imprisonment!</b> While enjoying some well-deserved shore leave, a local militia seizes a dozen members of your expedition without explanation. They are taken to a fortress that's been hollowed into the sandstone cliffs that dominate the harbour. The charges against your crew prove spurious to say the least, and when a hefty sum is demanded in exchange for their release, the militia's intentions become all too plain.","803044":"Afraid of the Light","803045":"<b>This man is severely ill!</b> A group of sailors bang on the door to the doctor's cabin. They carry a feverish friend, who between two moments of altered sleep mutters about a burning radiance and closes his eyes to protect himself from the deck's half-light. The doctor's inspection could reveal more symptoms, but shouldn't the crazed patient be secluded instead?","803046":"Inspect the man at the risk of contamination","803047":"Put the fool in quarantine","803048":"<b>The symptoms speak for themselves.</b> The man's neck is stiff, his breathing distraught, his cheeks paralysed. As the doctor explains to the rest of the crew the details of meningitis, the lying patient suddenly trembles, taken by a seizure of such intensity that his whole body arches upwards, bent in a pyramidal pose of impossible tension. He screams out the name of your doctor before falling down, dead.","803049":"<b>Your doctor is at a loss.</b> Fear of the light sounds like an ailment belonging to the realm of the Lord, and the man of science is too blinded by his fright to notice the change in his patient. In a fit of unforeseen anger, the sick man leaps on his healer and attempts to claw his eyes out, before being restrained by the surrounding sailors. What madness is this?","803050":"This was the delirium of a dying man","803051":"This was the accusation of a victim","803055":"<b>There is no truth but the voice of science.</b> The accusation was the plea of a sick fool. Your doctor knows what ravages meningitis can do to the mind of its victims, and his collected account of symptoms convinces your crew of your doctor's innocence and acute knowledge. He is free to inspect the men on board, and identifies several others who carry the symptoms. The sick are promptly isolated and disembarked at the next harbour, and your expedition emerges unscathed.","803056":"<b>The doctor's truth isn't convincing.</b> He fumbles through his explanations, as his limited knowledge of the dead man's illness begins to show. Even if the doctor did seem to correctly identify the ailment, he fails to justify the impressive death the crew just witnessed. Doubts linger as the expedition goes on, and the doctor spends the rest of trip isolated in a quarantine of defiance and distrust.","803057":"<b>Heavenly truths hide in the last wishes of a man.</b> The doctor is pressed for answers and asked to swear his innocence before the Lord: a feat too great, and a lie to heavy for him to bear. He confesses to having poisoned the sailor with mercury over a dispute of faith against facts - ironically, the doctor's own fear of the Light made him confess his sins. He is hanged, and your crew find relief in the punishment of the murderer.","803058":"<b>Isn't this judgement too hasty?</b> The doctor is immediately accused of having murdered the sick sailor, but he isn't enough of a believer to confess before the cross. He is nevertheless hanged for his supposed crimes. Relief tints the mood of your crew, but many know the punishment was hasty and unjust.","803059":"Observe the evolution of the lunatic's symptoms","803060":"Confine the madman in the hold","803061":"<b>Rabies, no doubt - confine him!</b> The man's unnatural fury keeps growing under the observation of the doctor, who finally discerns familiar patterns in his patient's behaviour. His massive salivation and rejection of any form of drink leaves little room for doubt: he has rabies. The sailors confine him into the hold without remorse, and wait for the illness to steal his life.","803062":"<b>The symptoms culminate in death.</b> The roped patient wriggles, drooling, screeching and screaming for the lights to be gone, until a seizure of astonishing magnitude takes him, leaving his cadaver frozen in an impossible position. The doctor realises, far too late, that he might have been facing a case of rabies. Around him, the crew grow restless: what if this failure of a scientist was still wrong?","803063":"Find evidence on the dead man's body","803064":"Find evidence in the dead man's belongings","803065":"<b>The flesh carries proof.</b> In the thigh of the dead man, your doctor discerns burn marks unlike any other, appended over a festering wound. This is the work of a priest, who applied a heated key of Saint Hubert over the bite of a rabid dog - in the hope, visibly misplaced, that the Saint would cure the ailment. The sailor had known of his fate, but chose to endanger his companions regardless. He deserved death.","803066":"<b>Your crew has had enough of the doctor's incapability.</b> The man of science probes the body, tearing its clothes to reveal bruised skin and vulnerable flesh - a sight which convinces the sailors that they have seen the boundaries of his skill. The doctor is seized and roped alongside the cadaver he was desecrating, being left to ponder his calling in the depths of the hull. At the next harbour, your crew grimly realise that the doctor's wrinkled mass will never do harm nor good again.","803067":"<b>Undisputable evidence points to a grim story.</b> The inspection of the dead man's belongings lands no result, but your sailors know better than to consider this failure as final. They extend their search to his sleeping quarters, and within the loose planks of an amateurish repair, they find their proof: a key of Saint Hubert, a vital artefact for any believer suspecting the menace of rabies. The sailor knew of his ailment and chose to hide it. This truth pains your crew, but the closure brings relief.","803068":"<b>No proof, no trust.</b> Your sailors are no good at sleuthing, especially under pressure, and they find no proof pointing to the nature of the dead man's illness. Suspicion rises as the doctor orders the immediate burial at sea of the cadaver. Long after the cloth-wrapped body was thrown into the sea, the cadaver of the dead man is found hidden in the hull. There is little doubt as to who was thrown overboard in its place.","803069":"<b>Your sailors will have nothing to do with this lunacy.</b> Sending the sick man to the depths of the hold is a cruel choice, but it lowers the risk of any otherworldly contamination. His howls bedevil the ship until his voice becomes whisper, then silence. His body is buried at sea in a hurried parody of ceremony, as the sailors avoid discussing his unknown illness.","803070":"<b>The sick die alone.</b> Afraid of the man's state and the contagion he could potentially spread, your sailors lock him up in an empty cabin. He offers no resistance, and during the following days, his presence is reduced to sporadic whimpers and the occasional monologue. When the voice finally dies out, the sailors carefully wrap his body in cloth and bury him at sea, both relieved and sorry that they let him die a dog's death.","803072":"Ghosts in the Ice","803074":"Diagnose the sailors' condition","803077":"Break the floe with your cannons","803078":"Ignore their plea and leave","803080":"<b>Scurvy.</b> While inspecting the mouths of the stranded sailors, your doctor's fingers go straight through their gums as if they were made of paper, and the teeth below quit their lodging with a shake and a pull. The ill men admit to having already buried two of their own at sea. More will follow if they do not eat fresh food soon.","803081":"<b>The unknown illness might attack your crew.</b> Your doctor cannot pierce the mystery of the strangers' ailment: their ghost-like bodies fascinate as much as they terrify. Too scared to properly inspect their cadaverous skin, he hurriedly affirms that any sort of prolonged contact with them would put your own sailors in danger. Your ship whisks your crew away from the imaginary threat, leaving the strangers to die.","803082":"Part with a large portion of your supplies","803083":"Hunt the floe for fresh meat","803084":"The starved sailors eye your food with envy","803085":"Confirm","803086":"Cancel","803087":"<b>Your loss will help their survival, no doubt.</b> The donated supplies are enough for the strangers to hold out until rescue comes. Your crew promises to look for the nearest harbour and call for help there - a promise which they are likely to keep, forced as they will be to resupply in order to avoid their own starvation.","803088":"<b>There are not enough supplies for both your crew and theirs.</b> Your sailors stop rummaging through their cargo, and must deny the stranded men their hope of renewed supplies. The poor souls are too weak to vent their anger, but their empty looks and cursing whispers follow your crew long after the ghost ship has been swallowed by the horizon.","803089":"<b>The icy domain gives a profuse bounty.</b> Your fishermen forsake the idea of exploring the floe, knowing that the local game hides underwater. Adapting to the hostile environment, they catch enough seals to feed the whole crew, and the feast, even if it doesn't miraculously heal the sick, seems to at least replenish their spirit. They encourage your crew to use your ship's cannons to break the ice encasing their ship - despite the risk of damaging their hull.","803090":"<b>The hunters can't find enough food.</b> Your sailors manage to track, find and trap a few seals, but the bounty's not enough to feed a whole crew of ailing men. It might be enough for them to hold out until a rescue mission arrives, however - if there were less of them, or if they followed a strict rationing discipline.","803091":"<b>The floe is barren.</b> Unable to catch any game on the frozen ice and the surrounding hills of snow, despite the numerous tracks sprinkling the area, your hunters come back empty-handed and ashamed. The stranded sailors appreciate the effort, but their eyes grow duller still. They're still desperate for any kind of help.","803092":"Blast the floe apart","803093":"Promise to call in help and leave","803094":"<b>The ship is freed!</b> Your artillery men take hold of the stranded ship's cannons, ordering the crew to coordinate their frozen artillery with your ship's own firepower. The combined shots from both vessels trace the contours of the ice, breaking it with successive volleys until the floe parts and lets go, much to the appreciation of both crews. One of the sailors who helped fire the icy cannons even offers to join your voyage, having been taken in by your crew's kindness and brilliant skills.","803095":"<b>Your shots break the ice, along with their hull.</b> Shooting a cannonball through an exact thickness of ice without going any further requires a degree of control that your artillery man doesn't have. The blast pierces through the floe with a resounding crack, but the splinters projected by the impact are both ice and wood. The stranded sailors are thankful for your help - and the water did cushion most of your cannonball's power - but your crew still feels guilt at seeing their ship hobble away.","803096":"<b>Your crew promises to send help.</b> They leave the stranded men after telling them of steam-powered icebreakers and expeditions versed in the art of rescuing people such as them, and the tales seem to satisfy their angst. Your sailors hope that the next harbour will indeed provide such saviours.","803097":"Invite as many as you can on board","803098":"Order and enforce strict rationing","803099":"<b>They are desperate for help, and accept your proposal.</b> Your diplomat pressures the strangers more than she reassures them, and her pragmatic approach to the problem manages to convince them. About a third of the sick embark upon your ship, whereas the remaining sailors huddle together to share the meagre food that was hunted for them. Going back and forth between the closest harbour and the trapped ship drains both your crew and your time, but the rescued men are indefinitely grateful.","803100":"<b>Your diplomat cannot convince anyone to stay behind.</b> Rather than depicting the reasons behind your crew's decision, she bluntly announces the number of strangers allowed on board, and sparks an immediate frenzy. The skeletal men rise on trembling legs, their limbs pulled forward by the puppet strings of hunger, rushing into each other until most strings are cut. The culled crew climbs aboard your ship, and their soulless presence plagues the rest of the expedition.","803101":"<b>The system is strict, but it allows them to hold their ground.</b> One of your officers, and two of your biggest, most impressive sailors go down below deck on the stranded ship to distribute food portions, and teach the men about the merits and secrets of disciplined rationing. The crew nod their understanding, silent as your ship sails away. Hopefully they will follow your advice, and most will still be alive when a rescue ship comes to their aid.","803102":"<b>Your frail discipline falls apart.</b> One of your officers and a handful of escorting sailors order the starved men to ration the meat, lest they suffer from even more famine while your ship goes to look for help. Their lack of presence and conviction has no impact on the sailors, who throw themselves on the supplies and transform into beasts; frail animals who lack the strength to rip each other apart despite their will to do so. Your ship leaves in a hurry, leaving the fools to their madness.","803103":"<b>A job carried out with few hitches.</b> Making sure that they don't damage the ship itself, your sailors fire cannonball after cannonball, taking the time to appraise and readjust their aim with each new shot. The ship's hull is grazed by the first shots, and soon the floe parts before the vessel, the ice blocks gliding against each other with menacing cracks. The trapped crew profusely thank yours! Your sailors revel in their selfless act, trying to ignore the emaciated faces and feeble voices.","803104":"<b>A reckless failure.</b> Your sailors have no notion of subtlety, and even less understanding of their own firepower. The very first cannonball crashes straight through the ice, shooting beneath the waves and into the trapped hull below. Frozen foam explodes and stains the floe with streaks of grey, which all point at the gaping hole in the wooden frame. The stranded crew tremble back and forth to secure the leak, and refuse any more help.","803105":"Share supplies as an apology","803106":"They can take care of themselves, leave","803107":"Can we spare enough supplies for them?","803108":"Confirm","803109":"Cancel","803110":"<b>The best that could have been done.</b> The strangers accept your sailors' offer with reluctance, eyeing the leakage they caused more than the food that they offer. The compensation is enough to put your own crew in need of rationing, but it does not absolve their mistakes. Your ship leaves with promises to call for help at the next harbour, eager to leave the judging stares.","803111":"<b>The situation turns as bad as it could get.</b> Enraged by your retraction, the stranded crew flings resounding insults at your crew, followed by splinters from the broken hull, then the crates they'd prepared to store your offering, and finally, actual men. Fuelled by their ire and moving despite their cadaverous state, the assailants fire at will, oblivious to the retort of your crew. When the wraiths finally give in to death, your officers start to count the bodies.","803112":"<b>Your crew leave the stranded men to fend for themselves.</b> There's no mistaking the leak for a negligible issue: if the skeletal state of the sailors is any indication, they'll never have the strength to fix their ship. Allowing them to keep their pride might have been the granting of a last wish.","803113":"<b>The strangers are left to their grim fate.</b> One of your sailors crystallises your crew's fears by signing himself as the trapped ship disappears into the distance. The wraiths onboard were so close to death, they had already taken its guise.","803115":"<b>A ship trapped in the floe!</b> While navigating the treacherous Northern seas, your expedition happens upon frozen waters, whose masses spread over the horizon and plant their roots deep below the surface. Their dominion has imprisoned a ship much like yours. Skin parched, voice torn, eyes buried deep in their skulls, the stranded sailors sacrifice their last bits of strength to beg for help.","803274":"The Haunted Castle","803275":"<b>\"A-Anyone home...?\"</b> Seeking refuge from a thunderstorm, your people dash for the tumbledown castle. A flash of lightning illuminates its stark towers, barred windows and the solemn stone gryphons either side of the gate. As the last of your party crosses the threshold, an iron portcullis drops and clangs shut behind them! Despite their best efforts, your men cannot seem to lift it. The castle and its courtyard appear empty, but there is a sense that someone — or something — has been expecting you.","803276":"Cry out that you come in peace","803277":"<b>The officer refuses to give in to his fear,</b> but calls out steadily \"We mean no harm! We only seek refuge from the storm!\" As if by magic, the castle's great door creaks open. Your men accept the invitation to shelter, but with palpably less enthusiasm than would be customary on a night such as this. Inside, a once-opulent dining hall greets them, its few flickering candles burned down to a nub. But the attention of the crew is frozen upon the head of the long table, where <b>a vaporous woman appears to be hovering several feet in the air!</b>","803278":"Refuse to believe it is real","803279":"Shoot at the apparition","803280":"<b>The ghostly dinner guest shatters!</b> It was just a pane of glass, angled to reflect an old mannequin! \"Please!\" A dimunitive and smartly-dressed man emerges from the shadows, hands aloft, \"I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this is my latest invention!\" Relief turns to wonder as they marvel at the life-like mannequin he's created for the illusion. \"Permit me to make it up to you!\" he beams, flipping a switch that fills the hall with electric light. \"Geoffery,\" he calls up to the rafters, \"inform the cooks we have guests tonight!\" ","803281":"<b>Horror! The bullet passes through flesh and blood!\"</b> \"Patricia...! Patricia!!\" wails the illusionist, as he rushes from the wings to be beside the actress — his dying wife. \"Oh, lord! Whatever have you done, sirs!\" A moment later, she dies in his arms. That your soldiers were duped by a bit of make-up and a costume doesn't say much for their judgement. The expedition leaves the poor man and his tragic theatre set, and departs into the rain, which seems to fall harder and louder than ever before.","803282":"<b>The first mate's tremulous voice returns no answer</b> but its own echo, somehow distorted and corrupted by the castle walls. Could it be that whatever now inhabits this place, no longer has the power to speak? Or perhaps it is merely biding its time...","803283":"Look for a way out","803284":"<b>There's a way out over the walls!</b> Strangely, no ladder or stairs are found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. Through a maze of shadowy rooms and hallways, lit only by the occasional flash, the crew discovers a staircase to the third floor. From there they emerge onto the wall, and descend the dark and lush ivy on its exterior, welcoming the feel of the pouring rain from which they had so recently sought to hide.","803285":"<b>This castle was clearly designed to keep people in.</b> Strangely, no ladder or stairs are found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. After what feels like hours wandering the labyrinthine corridors of the keep, a peculiar door swings open. It appears to lead to a master bedroom. A soft, plaintive song rises from within, where a young woman is found at her mirror. She sits combing her hair, her bridal dress soiled and torn, and her face impossibly pale.","803286":"Refuse to believe she is real","803287":"<b>Faith steadies the soldier's hand as he approaches the bride,</b> but then he stops abruptly. \"You should see your faces!\" cackles a diminutive and smartly-dressed man, emerging from the shadows. Suddenly the room fills with electric light. \"I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this little beauty is my proudest invention.\" He winks and twists the bride's head one-hundred and eighty degrees. The automaton is so lifelike, it chills your men even now. They do not take well to learning the illusionist has been toying with them, and leave early the following morning, still very upset.","803288":"<b>Their faith cannot prepare them for this.</b> Her head suddenly spins on its axis, her face not young and pale as in the mirror, but shrunken and grey — a thousand-years old! — its empty eye sockets seething with a colony of larvae! The sailors run, rushing through the dark, dark halls, trampling the rickety stairs, and out into the rain. Finding the portcullis raised, they rush for the beyond; a lifetime of insomnia.","803289":"Shoot at the apparition","803290":"<b>The phantom bride shatters!</b> It was just a sheet of glass, angled to reflect a mannequin in a hidden alcove! A small man storms in from the shadows. \"Who do you think you are, destroying my precious illusion?\" he screams. \"Have you any idea how much effort — not to mention expense — I'd invested in this pure sheet of glass, and the lifelike skin of the mannequin you've just pierced with your bullets! Get away from this place — away!\" Your people trudge out into the rain.","803291":"<b>Horror! The bullet passes through flesh and blood!</b> \"Patricia...! Patricia!!\" wails the illusionist, as he rushes from the wings to be beside the actress — his dying wife. \"Oh, lord! Whatever have you done, sirs!\" A moment later, she dies in his arms. That your soldiers were duped by a bit of make-up and a costume doesn't say much for their judgement. The expedition leaves the poor man and his tragic theatre set, and departs into the rain, which seems to fall harder and louder than ever before.","803292":"Try again to force the gates","803293":"<b>Success!</b> Unable to resist the sailors' immense strength, the portcullis raises just the fraction needed to get everyone underneath. It takes good teamwork on the far side to get the last stragglers under, and the crew emerge shelterless, but free of this nightmarish place. ","803294":"<b>It's useless.</b> Everyone tries their best, but they simply don't have the strength. Two men strain their shoulders, but still the portcullis cannot be raised an inch. Someone notices a cable leading from the top of the barbican where the portcullis is held, up to a high window on the keep.","803295":"Try to scale the walls instead","803296":"<b>Finally free of this nightmare!</b> The sailors are able to help each other up to the battlements, despite the interior walls of the castle being smooth and featureless — almost as if they've been designed to keep people in... Once they've clambered down the ivy on the other side of the thick walls, your expedition party begins to look for somewhere safe to sleep — if it's not too cold and wet, that is.","803297":"<b>Only the able-bodied make it.</b> The interior walls of the castle are smooth and featureless — almost as if they've been designed to keep people in...  However, only when the skilled climbers reach the battlements do they realise that there's no easy way to help the rest up. \"We'll come back for you in the morning,\" they say. Returning after a damp and sleepless night, they find the portcullis raised, yet can see no sign of their comrades. A thorough search of the castle is conducted, but the devilish place is found to be completely deserted.","803298":"Shelter in the castle courtyard","803299":"<b>It's a foul night in the rain.</b> There's minimal shelter from the elements within these smooth and featureless walls, and the rising moan of the gale is unbearable. Finally, at dawn, the storm relents. At about half past the hour of ten, the castle door swings open, and a friendly-faced man emerges from it. \"What in blazes!\" he laughs, \"What are all you fellows doing out here!\" He explains that he is the heir to this castle, which he claims survived a siege in 1422, and that the portcullis is a rather sensitive beast these days. Your men are pretty peeved, not to mention a little feverish, at the thought they could have spent the night in a comfortable four-poster bed.   ","803301":"<b>\"It must be a trick,</b> for it most certainly is not real!\" says a young woman, who rushes forward, hand raised towards the figure. Just as she is about to touch it, it vanishes. \"There's a pane of glass here... a mirror!\" she exclaims. \"Impressive, isn't it!\" A diminutive and smartly-dressed man emerges from the shadows, hands aloft, \"I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this is my latest invention!\" Relief turns to wonder as they marvel at the life-like mannequin he's created for the illusion. \"Permit me to make it up to you!\" he beams, flipping a switch which fills the hall with electric light. \"Geoffery,\" he calls up to the rafters, \"inform the cooks we have guests tonight!\" ","803302":"<b>\"Disbelieve your eyes...!\"</b> The unconvincing advice only serves to startle the crew even further. The moment one of the crew plucks up the courage to take a step forward, the apparition abruptly vanishes. \"What manner of horror is this that we have just witnessed? I will not stay here a moment longer!\" he says. Finding the portcullis in the courtyard has mysteriously returned to the raised position, your crew take the chance to make a run for it.","803303":"<b>\"It-it cannot be...!\"</b> An officer's hand quavers towards the apparition, but the faceless woman mirrors him, pointing her claw-like finger as if to single him out. At this sinister omen, everybody dashes for the entrance, screaming, trampling and shoving one another in their haste to flee. Finding the portcullis in the courtyard has mysteriously returned to the raised position, your spooked crew take the chance to make a run for it, only for the portcullis to suddenly fall. No-one but that marked man is crushed under its weight.","803304":"Good Whale Hunting","803305":"<b>\"The whales are still around us!\"</b><br/>Impossibly large trails of water break the wake of the ship, and the froth parts to reveal dark, leathery skin. The whales are gaining speed, and their impact is imminent.","803306":"Launch the steam ship at full speed","803307":"<b>The wonders of technology!</b> The steam engines roar above the whales' chant, and the ship lunges away from the creatures in a cacophony of grating metal and whistling vapor. An investment well spent.","803308":"Maneuver the ship to avoid the whales","803309":"<b>A masterful maneuver!</b> The captain stirs the ship alongside the school of whales, and the animals glide past the boat in a slow and graceful ballet. The crew salute their captain's skill, and revel in the moment.","803310":"<b>Hard to avoid what you cannot see.</b> The whales are everywhere: on the sides, in front, at the back, and beneath the ship. The captain strains against the limits of his skill, but he cannot avoid the impacts coming from below, and part of the cargo is sent flying before the ship can escape.","803311":"<b>A school of whales is not a road you can simply navigate.</b> As the ship shifts to the side, the closest whale reacts to the sudden movement by playing dead: it stops swimming, and lets itself fall at an agonizingly slow speed. The impact with the rudder is brutal, and bends the vital mechanism.","803312":"Attack! Harpoon the closest animal","803313":"<b>A feat of strength for a gratuitous kill.</b> The harpoon impales the leading whale, and the rest of the school collides with its body, their advance being suddenly, and brutally stopped. The ship leaves without a scratch.","803314":"<b>The harpoon strikes a calf, causing the school to attack.</b> The wounded whale swirls to try and get rid of the iron rod, and its elders surround it, pushing the ship away from their young. The boat lists heavily to the side, and several men fall overboard.","803315":"Throw a roped harpoon to save the drowning sailors","803316":"<b>A harpoon is sacrificed to rescue the men.</b> The men grab the harpoon's anchoring rope and climb back on board, just in time to see the rope snap and fall into the abyss. The ship flees before any whales resurface.","803317":"<b>The rescue harpoon triggers the whales' attack.</b> The roped weapon could have made a good rescue device, but the giant marine mammals were already restless from the previous throw. A whale simply tilts up its head, and a massive wave engulfs the drowning sailors, crashing against the ship, and ramming it away from the begging and screaming men.","803318":"Get away from the flustered whales","803319":"<b>The fate of the drowning men is sealed.</b> As the ship retreats from the whales, the captain prays aloud for the sailors' survival.

A tale of dancing whales will be part of this expedition's story!","803322":"<b>The performance's efficiency is questionable.</b> Trying their best to be in unison, the sailors shout their hearts out more than they sing, and the underwater creatures don't seem to care. The group screaming occupies the crew for a long time, allowing the ship to drift closer to the school of whales.","803323":"<b>The crew embarrass themselves.</b> The underwater whales cannot hear the sounds squirming from the ship, and it's for the best. Dejected, their ears ringing, the sailors blame each other for the performance, and the team's unity and pride are deeply dented. Getting squashed by a whale would have been a better option.","803324":"Send a man in the diving bell to fix the rudder","803325":"<b>The sailor has rarely worked with such a view.</b> As the hours disappear while he fixes the rudder, the whales continue their inexorable advance in a vision of lethargic, yet grandiose movement. When the rudder is repaired, the whales are still passing by - and too close for comfort.","803332":"<b>The diving bell's rope tightens, then floats back up.</b> Both equipment and sailor are lost to the unfathomable depths and their gigantic inhabitants. The crew ponders whether the accident was caused by chance, or animal malevolence.","803333":"Keep sailing straight ahead, at the risk of collision","803334":"<b>Neither ship nor whale tries to avoid the impact.</b> Used to being a predatorless presence, the whale shoves aside the obstacle in its way and the ship is sent rocking. The creatures go on in indifference, reminding the crew of their meagerness.","803335":"Fire canons in the water to scare the whales away","803336":"<b>The tiny cannonballs somehow drive the massive creatures away.</b> As the sea foams and whitens under the force of the impacts, it hides what reaction the whales may have. When the froth clears, the animals seem to have dived away from the ship, but the men stay tense for a long while.","803337":"<b>Ten pound cannonballs against creatures of a hundred tons?</b> A whale slams into the ship, then another one, then another. The repetitive impacts make the crew believe the attacks are intentional, and they rally into begging prayers and whimpers. When the ocean's fury recedes, they're left to count the sailors thrown overboard.","803338":"Wait for the whales to leave","803339":"<b>The whales are not eager to retreat.</b> Used to being a predatorless presence, a whale shoves aside the obstacle in its way, and the ship is sent rocking.

Your crew need reminding too; mouths covered when coughing, the avoidance of skin contact, and the frequent washing of hands in alcoholic solution. It is chastening that your mere presence has caused the death of that poor girl, but after two weeks without further cases, it is certainly a relief it does not appear to have spread.","803382":"<b>Your people find it impossible to get the message across.</b> The locals go about their business as usual, disregarding the strictures you have tried to put in place.

The Lap of Victory is there waiting for you, and the Queen receives you warmly aboard. <b>You are finally able to ask why it is that she has run away.</b>","803517":"<b>You receive no answer.</b> Looking at your message again, it does seem a little abrupt – \"STOP IN THE NAME OF SIR ARCHIBALD!\" You pursue at a great distance towards Trelawney, the southernmost point of the Old World where not fifteen years previous a great naval victory was won over La Corona by the heroic Admiral Nadasky. The Lap of Victory slows to a halt, and the Queen receives you rather icily aboard. With a gulp, <b>you are finally able to ask why it is that she has run away.</b>","803518":"The Cape Of Trelawney","803520":"The Flower-Eaters","803521":"<b>The blue flowers have put the members of your expedition into a frightening delirium.</b> Among the tranquil villages of this delta, your crew had seen the water plants — baskets 'laden with flower and fruit' — everywhere, and had been curious to try them. \"You see, it does them no harm,\" the Captain had said encouragingly, as they made friends with some locals upon the riverbank one sleepy afternoon. But not long into the delicious feast of flowers, your expedition party are experiencing wild hallucinations!","803522":"Have the doctor intervene","803523":"<b>The doctor chuckles.</b> \"Here,\" he says, dosing each stricken soul with a concoction from his medicine bag, \"that should ease things.\" Soon everyone is sound asleep, and they awake the following day feeling refreshed. Unaware you've cheated, the flower-eaters are impressed! No-one normally handles their first encounter with the flower so well. <b>Taking it as a sign, they offer you something equally precious.</b>","803524":"<b>The worried doctor issues an emetic,</b> \"Throw it up, it's a poison!\" he says. Afterwards, the crew feel extremely weak, but the effect of the drug does indeed begin to fade. \"We just didn't have the guts for it,\" a sailor wipes his mouth. You have shown a weakness of constitution. All around, the flower-eaters share jokes at the crew's expense. <b>You leave humiliated.</b>","803525":"<b>\"I have just the tonic!\" your wild-eyed doctor quavers,</b> pulling a bottle of Vin Mariani from his satchel. However, the mix of wine and coca leaves only serves to heighten the delirium. Some awaken from the incoherence; others don't. The flower-eaters are clearly puzzled, and offer their condolences, for no concoction so ill-advised or unfortunate has ever been seen before — or since.","803526":"Ask the locals what's happening","803527":"<b>You are somehow able to communicate that you are suffering.</b> Many of the flower-eaters are seeing visions themselves — the effect they expect from consuming the plant. The locals interrupt their own lucid dreaming to help your expedition through it, realising your lack of experience in such rites of passage. The next day, your cosmic travellers feel relieved to return to the more familiar rocking of their ship.","803528":"<b>Your men become aggressive.</b> Unable to communicate, they resort to grabbing the locals. \"Drugged!\" one cries, \"What have you done to us?!\" There is every danger this is about to turn nasty.","803529":"Do nothing","803530":"Command them to fight their hallucinations instead","803531":"<b>They battle bravely against their shadows!</b> Heeding the officer's commands to resist, each of your veterans summons their inner strength to endure the sway of the little blue flower, drenched with sweat and thrusting their hands into the empty air. Eventually the horrors give way to narcosis, and a deep sleep lasting several days. This land of water lilies will take valuable time from your odyssey.","803532":"<b>Nightmares reveal truths.</b> The paranoia of their hallucinations centres on each other — a history of indiscipline and bad blood, grudges never properly settled. The drug has liberated those who feel they have been wronged. At daybreak, one of your expedition lies drowned in the river. Officially, the influence of the sinister blue flower will likely be blamed, but others are already telling a different story.","803533":"Let them go with the flow","803534":"<b>Your party open their minds to visions of the divine.</b> The horrors fade from view, and in their place come forest creatures, nymphs and dryads. Grand cities swirl as if formed of cloud, and golden ships voyage up to the moon.<br/>When the visions disappear, the crew realise they've experienced something extraordinary, and relate what they've seen to their hosts. <b>The flower-eaters offer a token of their appreciation</b> for a shared spiritual experience.","803535":"<b>Ahh... the intemperance of addiction.</b> Although they soon grow accustomed to the devilish hallucinations, your men now develop a profane appetite for the pleasures of the flower — slumber's holy balm. Procrastination, and apathy towards the supposedly 'materialistic objectives' of the expedition are the products of these indulgences. When finally dragged away from the sleepy waters, <b>the crew weep bitterly, and swear to be idle</b> for the remainder of their commission.","803536":"<b>The behaviour of your expedition is shameful.</b> One of the flower-eaters is shoved to the ground in front of her children. When several others pile into the scrum, one of your crew, who shall go unnamed, decides to set fire to a watermill in protest. This doesn't help anyone still having hallucinations. The next morning when they awake, everyone claims not to remember a thing.","803537":"The Coral Island","803538":"<b>The storm came from nowhere, wrecking your ship on coral-strewn shores.</b> For a time your crew feel like children again — dancing along the sand and bathing in the sun, as they await a verdict on the damaged hull. When it comes, the news is not good: extensive repair is needed, and with supplies so short, there is considerable disagreement. Why <b>concentrate on repairs</b>, given how long that may take, when both<b>food and water</b> are so urgently needed?","803539":"Your naval architect has a grand plan...","803540":"<b>The architect unveils a breathtaking sketch for the repair.</b> Seeking shade and isolation almost from the moment of the shipwreck, the architect devotes every ounce of concentration to their art. The result is a watertight schedule of renovation for the damaged hull, that aside from securing your swift departure, reminds all of the incredible talent committed to this expedition.","803541":"Explain why fixing the ship is paramount","803542":"<b>You make good progress on the ship repairs,</b> by offering a specific motivation: \"If we can get her fixed, there's a friendly port not far away.\" While she's not yet ready to depart, the crew are reassured that it won't be long before the ship is back underway. It might be an idea, meanwhile, to send a small party to look for food and water — you never know when the next chance will come.","803543":"\"Don't be distracted now — not when we're so close!\"","803544":"<b>Everyone is in agreement that the ship, their home, is of the greatest importance.</b> By the time the repairs are done, she looks an absolute picture. A sailor has good fortune and finds an equally beautiful conch on the beach. \"A keepsake for my son, Ralph,\" he says, \"he'll love it\".","803545":"<b>You can forgive the crew for being slightly distracted;</b> the work is hard, and they've been at it constantly. No amount of encouragement can speed things up. When the ship is ready, the expedition leaves immediately in order to remain on schedule.","803546":"\"We can spare a small hunting party\"","803547":"<b>You find great quantities of exotic paw-paws — and something else with paws!</b> \"It was alone and frightened, so we decided to adopt it!\" says the chubby bespectacled sailor. The crew rejoice at having a new friend aboard, and as if inspired by the little pup rolling around, they finish the repairs in double time.","803548":"<b>The ship has been repaired, but the hunters still have not returned.</b> You'd better decide if it's worth the risk to go after them.","803549":"Go after them","803550":"<b>You should have sent the second group first!</b> Your team have no difficulty tracking the original hunting party to the dense heart of the island, where they have somehow managed to get themselves lost. Perhaps it was all that fermented sapodilla fruit they've been eating! The captain jokes that the woozy-looking bunch should finish the repairs alone, but everyone is just glad that they've been found.","803551":"<b>Prey to themselves!</b> The deeper inland the search party venture — and this island is far larger than first they thought — the more animal they become. \"The beast... the beast!\" they say, believing something terrible stalks them, when all the while it has been within them. A huddle of the original party are found in a cave: scratched, kicked and bit. Neither group will speak of it when they return to the ship.","803552":"Wait for them","803553":"<b>They return just as those waiting on the beach have started to lose patience.</b> Everyone can see the hunters are rested and well-fed, having taken advantage of their little excursion at the expense of the many — and yet they claim they have found nothing. The ship sets off under a small grey cloud.","803554":"<b>The reaction is lukewarm,</b> and so is the effort: days pass and the work barely seems to move on. The remaining supplies are scarce. In the place they've been logging, one of the sailors finds some exotic mushrooms and brings them back to camp. Could this mysterious fungi be key to survival?","803555":"Ask the botanist","803556":"<b>Your expert happens to take more than a mere amateur interest in mycology,</b> and recognises these to be excellent-tasting mushrooms. Those fussy about fungi will have to learn to see them as fuel, because that breach in the hull needs fixing! Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.","803557":"Try to discern if they're harmful","803558":"<b>Your precautions are sensible.</b> A volunteer rubs the mushrooms on the back of the hand, and finding no visible reaction, touches it to his lips, then tongue, before tentatively holding it in his mouth. By this process it is adjudged safe, but the men boil it up just in case: rubbery but nutritious. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.","803559":"<b>Yes, they are harmful.</b> \"Go ahead and eat — the white ones are usually edible,\" says the doctor, who is no expert in caution, let alone fungi. Alarm bells ring when a sailor clutches his belly, and drops to his knees. To which do you attend — your sick or your boat?","803560":"Persuade the crew it's not worth the risk","803561":"<b>The crew see sense and wade through the repairs.</b> By the good fortune of being waterside, they also happen across the odd fish, crab or mollusc, which keeps everyone going until the work is done. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.","803562":"<b>The crew won't listen, and eat the doom 'shrooms.</b> \"We're good for nothing on an empty belly!\" they say, but alarm bells ring when a sailor drops to his knees. To which do you attend — your sick or your boat?","803563":"They look angelic, take a gamble","803564":"<b>They are indeed heavenly,</b> if lacking in quantity. Your crew's trust in the divine appears well-placed, and the repairs proceed without further incident. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your expedition can resume.","803565":"<b>These are Destroying Angels.</b> Alarm bells ring when a sailor clutches his belly, and drops to his knees. To which do you attend — your sick or your boat?","803566":"\"The sick must be our priority!\"","803567":"<b>The doctor is competent enough, at least,</b> to purge those affected with castor oil. It's a deeply unpleasant experience, but the crew bond, and take some determination into the repairs. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your exhausted crew are able to drift towards the nearest safe harbour to recover.","803568":"<b>\"A harmless experiment!\" says the doctor quickly,</b> whipping some ricin seeds from a coat pocket. \"Normally it would be castor oil used to purge their bowels, but I wonder if the seeds wouldn't do the same?\" Unfortunately, the doctor's seeds are extremely poisonous. In just a few hours, the patients are all dead. Devastated, and far fewer in number, the survivors take forever to complete the repairs. Exhausted, they drift to a safe harbour to try and recover.","803569":"\"We're all running out of time: fix the boat!\"","803570":"<b>The crew understand this is all about survival,</b> and take a newfound determination into the repairs. Those poisoned by mushrooms are close to death, but show grit and determination in self-treatment, and manage to pull through. Within a few days, the ship is ready, and your exhausted crew are able to drift towards the nearest safe harbour to recover.","803571":"<b>The words serve to scorn the sick and the weak,</b> their meaning in effect being, \"if you can't defend your share of what's left, you don't deserve to survive.\" It is only much later, when the ship is in port, that your brutes rediscover their compassion. They realise the expertise they've left for dead — those misfortunate enough to have been poisoned by mushrooms, or indeed, for having shown any other human frailty.","803572":"<b>Sadly, the absence of belief comes through in those words.</b> No-one seems to think repairing the ship on the remaining rations is possible. \"We're all going to die here!\" they say, \"unless someone stronger takes charge!\" You'd better offer a more democratic process, or else keep them fed, or there's going to be trouble.","803573":"Organise life on the island democratically","803574":"<b>The new system does ease the frustration a little.</b> In order for every opinion to receive due consideration and respect, only one holding a conch shell may speak, and they cannot be interrupted. Though the bureaucracy is both frustrating and incongruous in the circumstances, it at least allows everyone to have their say. Gradual progress is made on the hole in the boat, and the expedition eventually resumes.","803575":"<b>Democracy doesn't hold for long.</b> \"It's stupid that I can only talk when I have a shell in my hands!\" says one, \"I'm the one who found the fish that fed us yesterday — I should have the right to decide!\" Before long, the crew is lost in needless quarrels. The ship repairs barely progress in the coming weeks, and by the time the sailors can finally depart this vexatious coral island, they are close to starving.","803576":"<b>The system creates confusion and division.</b> \"Listen to someone because they're holding a shell? What do you take us for?\" The first mate leans raffishly from a rock wall, \"If you want to do things properly around here, come with me!\" <br/>From this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefield, with hoarded resources becoming motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair your ship, and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.","803577":"They just need to eat, that's all","803578":"<b>The food does ease the frustration a little.</b> Since fish and fruit now seem so easy to find, there is disgruntlement that this wasn't made the priority on arrival. Grudges aside, the crew are a lot sharper, and manage to get the work on the ship done despite a general lack of expertise. The expedition eventually resumes.","803579":"<b>The hunters find a piffling amount of food,</b> and with blood sugar levels low, the arguments are relentless. Fights and scuffles break out over the most trivial things, and the ship repairs barely progress in the coming weeks. By the time the sailors can finally depart this vexatious coral island, they are close to starving.","803580":"<b>There's nothing to eat, anywhere.</b> Repairs to the hull seem inconsequential when people are dropping like flies. But if hunger is the devil, those fallen bodies are the deal: best eaten while they're still fresh. From this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefield, with hoarded resources becoming motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair the ship — and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.","803581":"Agree to hunt for food and water","803582":"<b>The island is alive with animals.</b> While trapping a few pygmy deer, your hunters encounter a pig's head on a stick. It is rotten and buzzing with flies. As the crew move close, a filthy old man with a beard to his waist cavorts from the trees — surely a castaway who has never been found. \"Don't touch him, don't touch him!\" he shrieks, before turning to the pig head, \"My lord, I hope these troublemakers didn't disturb you?\" You aren't sure this loon can be saved.","803583":"Talk to the old mariner","803584":"<b>Something changes behind the old man's eyes</b> upon hearing the spoken word again. \"Forgive me — my Lord receives few visitors to his kingdom. Pray, from what kingdom come you?\"<br/>When they describe his own homeland, the old man begins to weep. \"Home! They want to take me home!\" He bows to the pig head. \"My Lord, with your permission I would leave your service and... Oh really, my lord? Thank you, thank you so much!\"<br/>There are plenty of supplies for the ship, and over the next few days' voyage, the old man slowly recovers his humanity, regaling the fabulous tale of his marooning.","803585":"<b>The onslaught of words seems to rile him up,</b>\"Get away, devil interlopers!\" He dances towards a keen-tipped spear, and jabs it at any who draw near. \"We don't believe you! My Lord does not believe you! You had better leave before he gets angry!\" The crew feel so claustrophobic with this man, and the fly-coated pig's head, that they run back to the ship. The voyage resumes without the extra supplies that all had hoped for.","803586":"Leave him to his pig-on-a-stick","803587":"<b>The hunters ignore the madman, and return to the boat.</b> \"Fresh venison!\" they cry up the beach, provoking a small cheer from the repair crew. Meat turning on a spit provides a good incentive, and the hull is finished in no time. When all settle down to eat, there is much curiosity about the wildman of the forest, and his pig's head. The expedition continues.","803588":"<b>Since they have found precious little food here, the men start to fight</b> over who needs it most. Tension is growing, and they will be at each others' throats if nothing is done.","803589":"Calm them down","803590":"<b>Though it only takes a few words</b> to remind them of how things would be done in the halls of government back home, the sailors have no choice but to suffer through the ship repairs on dreary rations. After weeks of hard work, the crew are finally able to sail away.","803591":"<b>The argument is rational to a fault.</b> \"If, like you say, it's all about survival, what are we waiting for? Let's weed out all the fat ones!\" Fearing mutiny if they do not comply with the wishes of the strong, your officers condone the malicious exile of the weak, allowing them to be left behind when the ship is finally ready.","803592":"Confine dissenters to the ship","803593":"<b>Thuggery rules out here,</b> and following a nasty scuffle, those with the most extreme views are seized and tied up in the ship's brig until the repairs are complete. The remainder get the hull job done, but it's a chore working under the lingering hostile atmosphere.","803594":"<b>Unfortunately, the most outspoken also prove the most savage —</b> it's about survival, and none of the normal rules hold here. They take vital charts and supplies from the ship to a stronghold up on the hill; a rock formation they have come to call \"the castle\". Your men lay siege and break through, but lives are lost. Before the expedition resumes, a small memorial — of coral — is erected for the dead.","803595":"<b>They make the island seem a barren hell,</b> their desperate thirst for meat finding no quarry. Repairs to the hull seem inconsequential when people start dropping like flies. But if hunger is the devil, those fallen bodies are the deal: best eaten while they're still fresh. The ship may be recovered, but these men will never be the same again.","803596":"Risk mutiny and demand the repairs","803597":"<b>It's good that your craftsmen are so adept,</b> because the impatience of the entire crew is palpable. Fortunately, by giving everyone something to do, those in charge of the repairs exude a quiet authority. Everyone learns to take pleasure in the details, and before long the ship is at least as fit for the expedition as it was before. They escape the coral corral with a profound sense of togetherness and achievement.","803598":"<b>\"Another week? Can't you see we're all going to die here!?\"</b> The beefy sailor rips the hammer from the carpenter's hand. Survival instinct has thrown the existing order into disarray, and from this moment on, things deteriorate rapidly. The island turns into a battlefield, with hoarded resources becoming motives for murder and betrayal. Only a chance passing ship, seeing smoke signals, comes to the rescue. They are kind enough to repair the ship — and wish the encrimsoned dregs of your expedition better fortune in their future endeavours.","803600":"<b>A perilous plunge!</b> Your expedition is walking along a narrow ridge in the rainforest interior, when they become entranced by the scintillating blue of 'Le Cotinga des Mezoas'. Perhaps it is the distraction of looking up at the extraordinary bird that causes someone to misstep. They fall suddenly through the floor, and tumble into fresh air, <b>only an elastic tangle of vines sparing them the drop. The problem now is that they're suspended above a ravine,</b> and it's a long way down...","803601":"Shout down, \"Slash with your sabre!\"","803602":"<b>It's a sword-swishing masterclass!</b> Your champion contorts to cut the liana above their right arm, and once free, cuts one daringly close to their neck, so that with a trapeze-like ripple they may dismount to the floor of the ravine. \"Simple!\" they declaim, straightening up, \"Follow me if you dare!\" There are hoots and cheers from the gallery above as the rest swing down on lianas, like an army of spider monkeys.","803603":"<b>A very lucky escape.</b> Trying to be cautious, your soldier makes a cut in one of the vines. The harness suddenly lurches down a further ten feet. Still, it seems a long way down. Another cut, and they are in freefall towards the bottom of the gully. Though cushioned somewhat <b>the impact causes a nasty ankle injury.</b>","803604":"<b>You have lost one of your bravest.</b>The first cut is wild, and sends them into a second tumble: there are gasps from above as your soldier clutches desperately at the foliage, but try as they might, they are unable to find anything to grip. The poor soldier pinwheels to the very bottom of the ravine.","803605":"Call down, \"Unpick the knot!\"","803606":"<b>It turns out to be an enjoyable puzzle.</b> The knot is examined in tense silence, until the light of revelation falls across their face. A tug here, a loosening there, and then voila! A slipknot forms that allows a breezy absail to the foot of the gorge. Your escapalogist bows to the exultant gallery.","803607":"<b>An infuriating tangle</b> — by the expression of your trapped expeditioner at least. Every tug seems to tighten the gordian knot further. \"Just cut it at the root!\" they shout up. \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely.\" When the lianas are cut, there are mere seconds of freefall before the impact. Though slightly cushioned — like a fork wrapped in spaghetti verdi — <b>the drop results in a nasty back injury.</b>","803608":"<b>A deadly conundrum.</b> The unfortunate victim tries pulling at different strands until one has an effect. The tangle of vegetation falls away but for a loop around the neck, which closes after only a few seconds of freefall, <b>resulting in instant death.</b>","803609":"At The End Of A Rope","803610":"Sunstruck","803611":"<b>Vampirical injuries!?</b> The path through the forest was barely visible beneath the lush vegetation. It isn't until they emerge from the pleasant shade of the trees that sunlight falls upon the crew, swelling up the skin of a few crew members with red rashes and throbbing blisters. Surely there must be a scientific explanation for their sudden photophobia...","803612":"Purify their skin","803613":"<b>The cold water soothes the burning almost immediately. </b> Your expedition party enjoys a little break away from sunlight, as they gently wash the rashes off with soap in a forest pool of fresh water.

They must have brushed against a giant hogweed!\" The treatment is simple: enjoy a little break away from sunlight and gently wash their skin with clear cold water. The blisters are gone after a few hours, and the group is ready to continue.","803616":"<b>The doctor dismisses the throbbing blisters as simple mosquito bites. </b> \"Just try not to scratch them. If you can't help yourselves, rub them gently, that's all.\" But a few hours later, the vesicles have already extended throughout their entire body. They collapse, unable to take a step further, whimpering with unbearable pain.","803617":"Reconsider the diagnosis","803618":"<b>This time, the doctor takes the symptoms seriously.</b> \"It looks like a chemical irritation. I wonder...\" The doctor rummages through the nearby flora and in time, he finds it: a tall stem crowned by an umbrella of small white flowers. \"A giant hogweed! Of course, its sap causes phototoxicity.\" Fortunately, the treatment is simple: a cold bath and a long break in the shade. Once they're clean, the doctor heals and bandages the lesions. But it comes many hours too late — his negligence will leave leathery red scars on the wretched few.","803619":"<b>\"It must be a rare breed of smallpox!\"</b> Your squeamish doctor doesn't even lean close enough to the pustules before squealing: \"Stay away from them!

The aching bunch are irresponsibly abandoned and left behind.","803620":"Expel the vampirical curse","803621":"<b>A miracle!</b> The priestess sinks the cursed crew members in a forest pool and blesses their foreheads with the symbol of the cross. \"Exsúrgat Deus et dissipéntur inimíci ejus,\" she recites, and the men and women exhale a sigh of relief as the burning fades away. Although they will have to live with the devil's taint on their skin for the rest of their days, each and every one of them feels thankful and blessed.","803622":"<b>The ritual is a most unholy sight. </b> \"Sunlight will purge your curse, bear the pain as evil oozes out of your body!\" The cursed few writhe under the scorching sun as their blisters slowly morph into aberrant lumps of fluid.

One of the tree's fist-sized wooden fruits had exploded, sending surprisingly sharp splinters into the man's right flank. Moving him could be fatal, but the shade of a tree that drops grenades is not the safest place to perform a surgery.","803628":"Rapidly remove the shards on the spot","803629":"<b>Your doctor's fingers move as a prestidigitator's. </b>He quickly feels the man's abdomen and locates every shard, pulling them out methodically before stitching the patient up.

It is not perfect, and the man's howls clearly state that it is in no way painless, but he survives long enough to be treated at the nearest village.","803636":"<b>If the crew were truly under enemy fire, they would all perish. </b> Not one voice is heard above the heated discussion. \"Getting away from danger is the priority, just help him up!\", \"He'll bleed out!\", \"Just swathe him together and let's get out of here!\". Unable to reach an agreement, and with the explosive fruit dangling above their heads, a grizzly sailor decides to take matters into his own hands — quite literally. \"Better out than in!\", he grunts, as he dips his bare fingers into the man's open wounds and pulls out the gory pieces before the horrified gaze of the doctor. But it's too late to stop him — there's a ripping sound, then a gurgle, and blood starts gushing out the man's mouth. Nothing can be done to stop the bleeding, and the dreadful scene is over within a minute.","803637":"Fashion a stretcher to move him safely","803638":"<b>An easy feat for your handy crew.</b> They get to work immediately, and — in the blink of an eye — two long branches, two coats and a symmetrical tangle of knots become a rock-solid stretcher. The wounded man is carefully removed from under the grenade-bearing canopy and carried back to the ship, where the surgeon is able to safely extract every piece of timber shrapnel.","803639":"<b>Stress only serves to highlight your crew's lack of skill.</b> Eager to get away from the lethal tree's canopy as fast as possible, they hastily tie two branches together and call it a stretcher. The precarious device barely holds the weight of the wounded man, and it collapses almost immediately. The man hits the floor with a thud, and his howl of pain forecast the worst: a fragment has pierced his liver. The man writhes in a feverish agony for days, before drawing his last breath.","803640":"La Manzanilla de la Muerte","803641":"<b>An officer has taken a bite out of a fragrant, but deadly fruit. </b> By the time your guide alerts the crew to \"stay away from la manzanilla de la muerte\", its sweet taste has already been rapidly followed by a peppery tingle, then an excruciating burn. Soon, the officer is frantically gasping for breath, his throat and tongue having tripled in size.","803642":"Puncture an airway","803643":"<b>The crew are hypnotised by your doctor's precision.</b> Without wasting a single second, she lays the officer in the sand, commands two men to pin him down, feels her patient's Adam's apple and makes one steady incision. She then inserts the handle of the scalpel and rotates it to open the new orifice up. The sudden suction sound as air rushes back into the officer's lungs triggers a communal sigh of relief. The whole crew can finally resume breathing.","803644":"<b>The crew stir before the grisly scene.</b> The panicked doctor — who's clearly never attempted such a procedure before — stabs the officer in the throat with her knife in an attempt to poke a hole for him to breathe through. Instead, the patient's blood spurts out onto her face. Her piercing shriek makes the whole crew shudder. The man falls to his knees and bleeds to death within seconds.","803645":"Calm the officer and steady his breathing","803646":"<b>Your diplomat's voice soothes everyone around him.</b> He firmly grasps the officer by the shoulders and helps him lie down on his side. He gently instructs the officer to picture a toy horse, rocking softly back and forth with his every breath. Now that the man is not panicking, a small stream of air finds its way through his swollen windpipe — but urgent treatment is required to remove the toxins from his body before it causes more damage.","803647":"Perform a stomach pumping","803649":"<b>Before receiving the command, your doctor was already preparing to treat the officer. </b>She had clean warm water, ready to be pumped into — and back out of — her patient's stomach through a rubber tube she'd expertly passed through the tiny gap left in his swollen pharynx. The gastric lavage is successful, and the officer's windpipe slowly clears out. It isn't until he's out of danger that the whole crew realises everyone had been holding their breath.","803650":"<b>'Negligent' falls short of describing your doctor.</b> In an attempt to purge the poisonous fruit from the man's stomach, she pours seawater into the poor officer's mouth. Not only does he howl in pain the second salt touches his inflamed throat, but the seawater makes him heave and choke on his blocked airway. The officer convulses and gurgles for five very long minutes, before he stops twitching altogether.","803651":"Make powdered charcoal to clean the toxins","803652":"<b>You master crafter conducts every crew member as a perfectly synchronised orchestra.</b> \"Not just any charcoal will do — it needs to burn at a very high temperature, and we don't have much time!\" An airtight clay oven is set up and smoking in the blink of an eye. Not an hour has passed before the powdered charred coconut shells are being fed to the agonising officer, cleansing his body of every toxin.","803653":"<b>Your crew's ineptitude proves fatal.</b> Even though the doctor insists that the charcoal must have been burnt at a very high temperature for it to absorb the poison from the body, all they can think of is setting up a bonfire and charring some driftwood. After making the officer snort the hastily powdered coals, the patient starts bleeding profusely out of his mouth and nose, choking and writhing in agony. There is nothing your crew can do for the man but put him out of the misery they aggravated.","803654":"<b>Every word that blurts out of your first mate's mouth makes the man fret more violently.</b> Your crew members can but watch, helpless and distraught, as the agonising officer's lips turn purple, then blue, while the first mate continues to screech at him to \"just calm down and breathe in\". The look of panic in the man's eyes pierces the souls of every man and woman present just before he falls unconscious. Nothing can be done for him.","803655":"The Devil's Trumpet","803656":"<b>The sound of a human scream alarms your expedition</b> as they pass through a small forest village. Good conscience obliges them to investigate, either <b>openly</b> or <b>in secret,</b> unless of course they feel it <b>best not to interfere</b> in local affairs.","803657":"Investigate in secret","803658":"<b>You choose two of your best,</b> who casually separate themselves from your group. The people in this region are used to western visitors, and suspicions are not raised. Peeking into a cabin, your agents sight <b>a woman being held by two men, while a third appears to be forcing her to drink some sort of herbal concoction.</b>","803659":"Burst in and stop them","803660":"<b>You take them completely by surprise.</b> In moments, the men are down and out for the count. The woman is eloquent and alert, and <b>she asks to join your expedition.</b> Once she is safely out of the village, she explains with sadness that the angry young men of a rival family have seized control of the region, and that it would be dangerous for her to remain.","803661":"<b>The odds aren't good</b> - two against three - and your scouts are knocked violently to the floor. The prisoner is forced to drink, and the vial's contents appear to make her compliant. The three young men push her out of the cabin. <b>When your scouts have themselves recovered, they wonder what they should do.</b>","803662":"Call for reinforcements","803663":"<b>Keen reinforcements arrive at the double, only to discover that the gang of abductors has grown.</b> They must be fifty-strong, a miscellany of raiders who've been terrorising the region. They are, however, wary of your capabilities, and agree to relinquish the captive woman in return for your immediate departure. Her relatives soon carry her to safety - <b>but with two casualties of your own, you'd best move on quickly too.</b>","803664":"<b>Your reinforcements charge idiotically</b> into an important local ritual, causing needless bloodshed. When the woman captive is seen being pushed into a grave of bodies, your men have no sense that this is just the theatre of the occult, and — to the bewilderment of the locals — they open fire. <b>The realisation of what they have done will traumatise your men for the rest of their lives.</b>","803665":"Let her go, it's not worth the trouble","803666":"<b>A dark silence falls over the village,</b> but for what sounds like the grim clink of shovels on soil. Your men better run for it before they quiver to jelly.","803667":"Better to stay out of it after all","803668":"Your men try to remain objective, but <b>the scene makes for uncomfortable viewing.</b> The drugged cup, made with the white devil's trumpet flower that grows all around, puts the woman into a somnambulant state, ensuring her compliance. She is taken outside and herded together with the other women, who appear to exist here in patriarchal servitude. <b>You leave feeling depressed</b> that negative stereotypes of other cultures appear to have been reinforced.","803669":"<b>It's likely to be an international scandal.</b> Your numbskull spies are caught snooping about, which as it turns out, is an act in breach of a treaty between these people and Her Majesty's government. The leader of the protectorate vows to tear up the treaty and ban all westerners from these territories in future. <b>Your officers all let out little screams inside.</b>","803670":"Ask the locals what's going on","803671":"<b>Your envoys are sensitive to the particulars of the region,</b> and the locals feel relaxed enough to talk. It seems it was the scream of a young boy: he had been misbehaving, and was given medicine so that ancestors in the spirit world might admonish him, but the medicine seems to have had a bad effect. He is trapped in his nightmares, sweating and screaming all the while. <b>The locals are worried, and look to you for help.</b>","803672":"Make a medical diagnosis","803673":"<b>The doctor knows botanicals.</b> In the dregs of the medicine cup, the doctor finds Brugmansia, also called Devil's Trumpet — a hallucinogenic plant known for its power to terrify. Though often used in ritual here, the dosage seems high for a child. The other villagers don't seem surprised, because his parents are the local idiots. The villagers are glad the doctor is able to help pump the poison from the boy's stomach, and after a few days he is back to his usual impish self. <b>Your expedition are proud to have been of help.</b>","803674":"<b>The doctor puts his hands down the boy's throat.</b> It isn't clear what he is trying to achieve by this, but it causes the boy to thrash violently from side to side. \"Damnation!\" cries the doctor, yanking out his arm, for the boy has bitten it. Then blood begins to pour from the boy's mouth, and a wriggling pink triangle flops to the floor. He has bitten out his own tongue, and <b>you are shooed angrily from the village.</b>","803675":"Consult your knowledge of world faith","803676":"\"Must be Brugmansia — also known as the Devil's trumpet.\" <b>Your clergyman is acutely aware of the local religion,</b> and knows the flower is used to induce spiritual delirium. \"Once the demon trumpet has been exorcised from his belly, I shall lead both the boy and his parents to a higher place,\" he says with a self-satisfied air, \"and this sort of thing need never happen here again.\" Rightly or wrongly, <b>your expedition will leave feeling it has done fine missionary work.</b>","803677":"Instead of helping the poor boy, <b>your clergyman gets carried away</b> with his proselytising. Being ignorant of the boy's exact affliction, he falls fearfully back to the age-old redoubt of the cleric: that all around them are wicked heathens. It takes several strong soldiers to drag him away, and <b>your expedition leaves feeling it may have tarnished Her Majesty's reputation.</b>","803678":"Ignore the screaming and carry on","803679":"<b>It sure sounded like torture,</b> and the sanctimonious among you waste no time in reminding everyone of that probability. While good fences make good neighbours, it doesn't hurt to be nosey and neighbourly from time to time.","803680":"<b>Your representatives don't approach it in the right way:</b> \"We heard screaming, and we demand to know the cause!\" These people see no reason why they should have to explain themselves to you, and produce a document with a royal seal granting immunity from such unwanted attention. <b>Your leadership feel embarrassed and undermined.</b>","803681":"Trespassers","803682":"<b>An ambush of missiles!</b> This unmapped region of the great forest is home to an indigenous people, whose policy is to pre-empt the hostility of trespassers into their territory. Suddenly a man grips his shoulder, where a feathered dart now hangs. It could have come from anywhere. Do you <b>hide</b>, <b>fight</b>, or if all else fails, <b>flee?</b>","803683":"Find cover!","803684":"<b>The rain of darts comes to an end</b> when your group quickly and cleverly diffuses, each finding their own space. Out of respect, perhaps, your ambushers decide to retreat — or do they simply believe the damage has already been done? Those who were hit begin to wheeze heavily, collapsing to the floor, for <b>the darts are tipped with poison!</b>","803685":"Identify the poison","803686":"<b>The doctor is praised for their quickness of thought.</b> \"Wolf's bane, of the slopes above,\" words pour out, \"classically lethal, but by Jove, I have an idea!\" An extraordinary antidote is proposed — a posset of deadly nightshade — and its effect is remarkable. \"Don't ask me how, but it's worked!\" the doctor says cheerfully, as the victims of the poison darts begin to return to normal. Your expedition marks the territory on the map for the sake of anthropology, before taking the long road around it.","803687":"<b>Anxious to avoid misdiagnosis, the doctor is slow to react.</b> Before long, the one who took a dart to the neck suffers opisthotonos — his back arching in spasm, before giving out to exhaustion. The death sparks the good doctor into life. \"Ah, so it's strychnine!\" he says gesturing to the trees, \"Sourced from breadfruit.\" Chloroform relaxes his patients for a cleansing irrigation, and somehow, they manage to recover. Time to leave this place.","803688":"<b>No-one has the faintest idea.</b> Those who took darts wear expressions confused and melancholy as they melt into darkness, wondering, perhaps, what the point of their sacrifice was. Your expedition bury the dead as fast as they can, lest the hostile peoples of this particular territory return.","803689":"Knowledge of local practices may yield answers","803690":"<b>It's what the locals know as 'ourare'.</b> Accounts from the region frequently reference it as a lethal coating for arrowheads, or in this case, blowpipe darts. A treatment is also mentioned — a form of mouth-to-mouth in which the resuscitator acts as an iron lung for the patient. And it works! There is no childish awkwardness, with an excess of volunteers offering to save their fellows. The victims of the poison are saved, and all emerge from those (often dark) hours with a new feeling of togetherness.","803691":"<b>\"You always hear stories about poison dart frogs out here,\"</b> says one of the officers. He doesn't seem to know much more than that, except that in a 'Boy's Own' adventure story, chloroform was used to treat frog poisoning. No-one seems to know where the medicine box is, but by the time it is found, someone has already succumbed to convulsions. It is only a slight relief then, that the chloroform does indeed relax the other victims sufficiently to keep their hearts beating. Time to leave this place.","803692":"<b>Your barbarous dimwits are ignorant of local customs.</b> \"Do they tip arrows with cyanide, perhaps?\" Your officer snaps, wiping sweat from his reddened face, \"How the devil would I know what these primitives use?!\" Those who took darts wear expressions confused and melancholy as they melt into darkness, wondering, perhaps, what the point of their sacrifice was. Your expedition bury the dead as fast as they can, lest the hostile peoples of this particular territory return.","803693":"<b>Unfortunately, the darts continue to find their mark,</b> for the hostile tribe know the forest too well.

There's a thud as one of the dart-blowers is struck down with the butt of a rifle. Whistles all around signal a retreat, leaving your men to examine one of the six-foot blowpipes: perhaps they left knowing the damage had already been done? Sure enough, those hit begin wheezing heavily, collapsing to the floor. <b>The darts are tipped with poison!</b>","803696":"<b>Your men make themselves easy targets,</b> desperately trying to pursue and isolate their adversaries, to no avail.

There is nothing to do but leave the unlucky ones contorting in agony.","803711":"<b>\"There's no other way, we must wade the swamp.\"</b> It doesn't look too deep at first, but soon the party are up to their waists in muddy water and too far in to turn back. A sinister log, seemingly adrift, mutates into the jaws of a dragon. <b>\"A gator!\"</b>","803712":"Take the shot","803713":"<b>Bullseye!</b> Your skilled huntsman pulls out his rifle and it only takes him one deep breath to put a bullet exactly two inches behind the creature's razor-sharp eye, hitting its marble-sized brain. The monster goes limp immediately and the crew members roar as they lift the legendary trophy above their heads, marking the day your daring huntsman became the dragonslayer.","803714":"<b>The creature's scales are bulletproof!</b> Your hunters fail to find a weak spot and every shot seemingly ricochets off the monster's skin. The creature growls, but the hail of pellets fails to stop its swift jaws from clamping down on your petrified navigator's arm.","803715":"Force the monster's jaw open","803716":"<b>A feat everyone will remember!</b> It takes ten men to restrain the alligator and pull its maw open only a tiny slit, but it is enough for your navigator to pull her chewed-out arm out. As she stumbles away gripping her limp arm, a sailor sinks a knife in the beast's neck and it slowly stops twisting and wriggling. Everyone is bruised and scratched, and the navigator might never fully recover from her wounds, but she will never forget they way her comrades risked their lives to save hers.","803717":"<b>They underestimated the monster!</b> Two men confront it head on, as the rest of the party watch meekly from afar. The beast snaps the navigator's arm as if it were a twig and launches itself onto the men, fast as lightning. It takes one of them by the armpit and, with a fearsome roll, rips his body apart. Both creature and man disappear in the murky water, leaving nothing but a trail of gore behind.","803718":"Run for your life","803719":"<b>The crew waddles away as fast as they can, </b>leaving their navigator trapped in the jaws of the monster. Luckily, the creature is sated with one big bite out of her forearm, and she is free to catch up to her cowardly comrades and escape the situation with nothing but a gruesome scar and an irreconcilable mistrust in her fellow crewmen.","803720":"<b>A tragedy!</b> Each armed crew member draws their pistol and unleashes a hail of pellets upon the beast. Not only is the reckless manoeuvre utterly ineffective against the monster's bulletproof scales; your petrified navigator is caught between the beast and the open fire. With nowhere to run, she falls an easy prey to the gator. It shakes her tiny body around in its jaws like a puppet and pulls her down to the cloudy water, never to be seen again.","803721":"Tackle the beast","803722":"<b>A legend has been born!</b> While some members of the crew distract the beast, one bold sailor jumps on the gator’s back and clutches its neck. It takes ten more men to pin the monster's maw shut, but once it's immobilised, the sailor pulls out a knife and sinks it into the monster’s skull. At first the creature twitches, but then it goes limp. The crew members roar as they lift the legendary trophy above their heads, marking the day their daring crewmate became the dragonslayer.","803723":"<b>A miraculous escape!</b> While some members of the crew distract the beast, one bold sailor draws a knife, jumps on the gator’s back and clutches its neck. But he's no match for the monster's atrocious strength, and it easily squirms out of his embrace, shutting its maw around his arm. With a harrowing howl, the man manages to sink his knife into the alligator's skull, killing it instantly. The stump on his arm shall forever remind him of his heroic feat.","803724":"<b>They underestimated the monster.</b> Two men confront it head on, as the rest of the party watch meekly from afar.

Through the little glass window, a forest of living pastel appears, of which some of the more beautiful examples are embedded in the hull. Once your divers have detached the lifelinks constraining your vessel, your crew are free to resume what is becoming a fascinating journey.","803731":"Send free divers down to remove the coral","803732":"<b>Your divers take to the sea like fish to water,</b> having had some dive training with the navy. Still, the others worry when five or six pass, and they still have yet to surface. Suddenly the boat begins to wobble — they've been cut free! Soon after, your heroes emerge from the water giddy and glistening, brandishing the magnificent coral in their hands.","803733":"<b>They can barely hold their breath for long enough</b> to reach the coral floor, and as such, they're forced to cut the ship free in relays. Error creeps in to their work along with feelings of lightheadedness, and <b>one of the divers slices his foot open on a shank of coral.</b> Everyone is too absorbed in their task to notice, but once the ship is free and back at sea, the pustulent swelling of the man's foot becomes increasingly difficult to ignore...","803734":"Tend to the diver's foot","803735":"<b>Although your medic does take immediate action,</b> vigorously scrubbing the wound and flushing with fresh water and vinegar, the coral cut takes a surprisingly long time to properly heal. \"Will I die? Is this the end?\" the injured officer complains, as if an invalid to be waited on hand and foot. Thankfully, eventually the swelling reduces, and everyone can get on with their lives.","803736":"<b>Someone puts bandages around the wounds in a haphazard fashion,</b> as if they were mere scratches. \"Change the bandages every few days\" is the advice, but the abscess that has formed beneath soon bursts, and the vile infection spreads. <b>The man dies in his sleep.</b> For the others, their negligence will forever remain a source of great shame — for no man is an island, and the death of one man diminishes the whole.","803737":"Tell him to grin and bear it.","803738":"<b>The diver develops a fever.</b> The abscess does not disappear, and a nasty infection spreads up the arm causing it to become swollen. He will be of no use on the ship for the remainder of the expedition, instead serving only as an unpleasant reminder of the officers' inhuman disregard for the welfare of their crew.","803739":"Find a cunning way to free the ship","803740":"<b>Your ship looks a sensation now she has coral poking from her keel.</b> Like doctors treating a foreign object, your fine craftsmen utilise a panoply of tools to reach under the hull and fragment the coral. They are then nimbly able to dress the wound in the hull before very much water gets in. The few naughty pieces of coral that remain wedged in the keel look rather fetching!","803741":"<b>They use a lot of spare materials, but it works.</b> Fighting against the slant of the ship, they are able to fragment the coral with a long pole they have constructed out of wood and rope. It is extremely heavy, however, and as the ship judders free, your men cannot stop it from sliding into the sea. It feels like a waste, and there's only just enough wood left to repair the breach in the hull.","803742":"<b>There is a lot of head-scratching below deck,</b> as your confused carpenters try to fight the flood. They have neither the tools nor creativity to do much more than smash the coral that has ripped through the ship.

He opens the storage and among the amount of perfectly good supply, he notices that the porridge's cereals have a strange smell. Inspecting closer, opening a seed, he notices tiny worms going out of it. \"The food was not poisoned, the supplies went bad. The only blame we could give her is for negligence but certainly not murder.\" The crew is relieved to learn nobody acted malevolently.

But you shouldn't\"t beat yourself up, I am sure now certain the porridge didn't kill him. here, have a drink, relax a bit. It's a cocktail I learnt about a few weeks ago, rum and cherry liquor, a delight!\" He pours the rum and the content of the bottle into glasses and offer them to the two men. He observes their reaction. As the cook reaches for the glass without hesitation, the assistant winces. \"I ... I am not thirsty thank you.\" The doctor stops the cook from drinking and says, \"A shame, considering you will only get water and old bread from now on.\"","803787":"The doctor has absolutely no idea what the bottle contains. It is not banana for sure, but it doesn't mean it is poison. It's part of the cook's supplies but it doesn't prove he is involved.","803788":"Hold his head over the stove so he confesses what he knows","803789":"He is held tightly, making it clear he cannot escape. As soon as his head comes close to the stove, the cook confesses immediately. Denounce his assistant who wanted to get revenge on the victim for mistreating him for months.","803790":"Does not hold him correctly, a fight ensue above the heated stove. In the melee the cook finishes head first on the fire, burns half of his face, his skins melts.

The suspicion remains high but nobody else dies.","803793":"Grill the cook and his assistant to learn the truth","803794":"By interrogating them separately, the cook assistant makes a mistake in his version of events, was trying to frame the cook for the murder in order to take his spot. He is tied up and put in the ship jail and awaits his trial.</br>The crew is relieved but still resent the death of their comrade.","803795":"All the facts are straight, or rather the diplomat fails to see the holes in the stories.

There is no shame in reporting criminal. On the contrary, you are doing society a favor. If you come forward now, we will be merciful and forgive you for not speaking up earlier. But should we discover later than you knew all along, then you will share the murderer's fate.\" The diplomat speech has a strong effect. Sailors start to murmur between themselves when unexpectedly one of them comes forward \"I know who did it. I am sorry Jimmy but you can't get away with it\" he says as he turns toward the cook assistant. 'Jimmy wanted to punish Robert and Charles for mistreating him but he didn't realize the poison would be so strong it would kill them\". A murder is a murder, even if unvoluntary. Young Jimmy is seized and hanged. The crew is relieved the perpetrator has been found but sad to see a young man die for a stupid mistake.

The crew spends the rest of the trip in suspicion and the truth is not uncovered.","803802":"Analyze the body","803803":"Examining his throat and stomach, it is clear that the sailor had an allergic reaction to the type of cereals used in the porridge. It is a regrettable accident but everybody is relieved to learn no murderer is on board.","803804":"Considering the quickness of the death and the effects on the body, especially the stomach, ingested poison is a viable explanation but there is no certainty.","803805":"Look through the cook and his assistant belongings","803806":"Find a letter proving the assistant guilt, wanted to frame the cook for the murder to take his spot. He is locked on the ship and kept there until the end of the expedition so he can face a fair trial once back home. The men are relieved the threat is gone.","803807":"The hunter finds no proof, the case is dropped. The captain, disappointed, announces \"We have neither proof of culpability or innocence.

Undeterred by the howl and buffeting of the wind, they manage to put the sails 'in their gear' — loosing the sheetlines, and pulling the buntlines through, until the ship is safely running under jib alone. When the storm passes, the crew are delighted that <b>thanks to these mighty efforts, the ship has come through unscathed.</b>","803898":"<b>Not easy handling sails at minus thirty,</b> and while those brave enough to take on the ice storm are strong enough, their labour is clumsy.

The walk turns marvellous as the men become the lucky observers of aurora borealis under a stellar sky hindered by no lights. </br>They reach the Inuit camp in the early morning.","803998":"In the dead of the night the group is more and more scattered as one of the men has a harder time following. He falls behind. This is the moment the beast chooses to target the weakest of the pack. The group hears a muffled sound, a piercing screams and horrible growling mixed with tearing and chewing noises. As the group turns toward the noise in terror, they see an enormous polar bear.","803999":"Stranded Off Terrier Island","804000":"<b>Your ship is stranded on an iceberg!</b> It is night along the east coast of Terrier Island. The meek light of your vessel seems to dissolve into the moonless blackness. Even at easy sail and under constant vigil, your ship runs the risk here, for slumbering ice giants leer from the darkness in all directions. \"Dead ahead!\" comes the cry, but it's too late! A low growl shakes the boat, as a wave dumps it atop a iceberg — in the shape of an upturned molar — beaching it there. The ship is undamaged, if only it could be returned to the water...","804001":"Break free with dynamite","804002":"<b>Nothing in nature can prevail against human endeavour,</b> it would seem. The crew watch with trepidation as the fuses burn down to the stick, before an ear-splitting series of detonations rings across the vastness, sundering the icy claws that had held your ship hostage. A small blizzard of debris blankets the deck, to the delight of all aboard, for they are free once more!","804003":"Bombard the icy prison","804004":"<b>Ice crumbles around such firepower.</b> Any cannon that can be swiveled at the target is put to use, chipping away at the icy dungeon in which the ship has become wedged, until the vessel breaks free. Like a cheerful sea lion, the fair vessel slips down an escarpment and plops back into the water. The crew cheer and continue on their way.","804005":"<b>The iceberg fights back.</b> Though the way is almost clear, the relentless cannonfire seems to have woken the ogre below, and to the horror of the crew the vast iceberg rolls slightly to one side. Great shards of ice detach and bounce over the deck, injuring your men. <b>Quick action is needed.</b>","804006":"Get out and push the ship free","804007":"<b>Your men live for such challenges,</b> and scarcely need telling what to do. Leaping down from the boat, they get behind her, knotting guy ropes as fast as they can. The iceberg still rumbles ominously, but it is your quick-thinking crew who prevail. Once clear of the ice field, the crew will be able to treat their wounds.","804008":"<b>It's an uphill struggle.</b> The pitching of the unstable iceberg does not help one jot, as the men tumble and slide as they struggle to find their grip. Such is the effort required to pull the ship successfully down from the iceberg into the sea, no-one notices that one of the teams is missing. It appears they have fallen through a thin part of the ice to their deaths.","804009":"Let the rolling iceberg toss you into the sea.","804010":"<b>Your ship performs a rather messy dismount.</b> After its initial roll, the iceberg halts long enough to suggest it wants to stay in its new position — but then everything happens all at once. The iceberg spins violently, and the ship with it! The ship strikes the water at such an angle that serious damage is done to much of the lee-side. Fortunately, the crew emerge unharmed.","804011":"Build something to help you escape","804012":"<b>The crew assembles a dozen hardy levers to free the ship.</b>  Flexible hickory planking is cut and reshaped into wedges, before being inserted into the ice at intervals of five paces, until they surround the stern. On a count of three the men lift — and to their surprise, so does the hull! Once it starts moving, there's no stopping it, and it clatters through all icy obstructions to the sea. Your sailors embrace — they have been very resourceful.","804013":"<b>The wrong wood is selected for the task.</b> It is a decorative mahogany veneer, stripped from the Captain's cabin. \"Whatever it takes,\" the Captain says with laudable magnanimity, but the whole business is futile. Despite the wedges being placed in great number at the stern of the ship, no amount of pressure from the crew can encourage the ship to move, since the levers lack the requisite spring. They'll need to find another way off this iceberg.","804014":"Search for Sir John along the east coast","804015":"<b>Free of the iceberg,</b> the crew manage to circumvent Terrier Island via its easterly shore. However, they have found no trace of the lost expedition. You'll have to try the west coast, next.<br/>Sir John must have taken the risky option.","804016":"The Narrows","804017":"The west coast of Terrier Island is snaggled up with monstrous horns of ice. <b>Navigation is going to be tricky.</b> Will the narrows lead back once more to open water, or will your ship end up stuck? You can <b>navigate carefully</b>, <b>get a better view</b> of the channels from a nearby rock, or <b>send scouts ahead in rowboats</b> to see.","804018":"Find a path through the narrows","804019":"To their relief, <b>your crew reach the open sea on the other side.</b> As there is a lack of consensus on magnetic north at this time, your navigators decide to ignore the compasses and trust their instincts, saving them a collision on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>The crew enters King William Sound, a majestic carpet of water leading up to its seat, King William Island. <b>Sensing something, Lady Faithful suddenly emerges from below deck,</b> and voices the determined hopes of her heart...","804020":"<b>The compass readings are confusing.</b> After several wrong turns, the crew realise magnetic north is not where they — or where anyone else imagined. Your ship finds itself alongside the run-off of a sizeable glacier, which, as it's spring, is melting.

He has noticed that <b>an ice sheet lies between your ship and the trading post.</b>","804044":"Take the safest route by avoiding the cracks","804045":"<b>Your crew's instincts are solid.</b> Keeping just the right distance apart, they move at a purposeful speed, avoiding the cracks and dark splodges indicative of thinner ice. They reach the abandoned building without incident.","804046":"<b>Their knowledge is shaky.</b> One of your groups avoids the gaping holes, but fails to notice the darker patches of thin ice. Cracking can be heard, but none of the group dare move. They hit the water with a woosh as the brûlée snaps. It is freezing, and they are struggling to climb out on their own. <b>If not rescued quickly, they'll die of hypothermia.</b>","804047":"Haul the sailors out with a rope","804048":"<b>The rope team keep balance.</b> Lying down, and spreading out to distribute their weight, they throw ropes to those in the water, who thrash to bind themselves under their armpits. On a count of three, they are hoisted clear of the water. <b>Wet and chattering with cold,</b> your expedition takes refuge in the old trading post.","804049":"Forget strength, <b>what they needed was teamwork.</b> The rope team disregard their own safety and pull as they would on dry land. The ice was never going to hold, and it soon collapses beneath them. Some manage to crawl free of the water and save themselves, but <b>others slip away</b> to fertilise the ocean bed.

The first measurement is 11 inches — no hazard even for a sizeable group to pass over. Every few steps a new reading is taken, but it proves a mere formality, since the readings change very little. <b>They make the abandoned building without incident.</b>","804055":"<b>It was never going to work,</b> using a heavy, blunt instrument to make the hole. Lucky as it happens that the carpenter is alone when his sledgehammer comes down, sundering the ice all about him and casting him into the freezing water.

The others trudge on for the thin comforts of the disused trading post in disbelief.","804056":"Risk walking over it","804057":"<b>The inevitable splosh.</b> Despite the cold wind, it is still summer in the Arctic, and the weight of a large group of bodies would test thicker ice than this. Halfway across the sheet, there is a rasping crack, and your men are deposited into the water. In their struggle to escape they have to kick off their snow boots. Chattering, they make it to the thin comfort of the abandoned trading post with <b>their feet in a terrible state.</b>","804060":"Narrow channels","804061":"The sea on the West coast of Labrador island is covered in ice. There is almost no space for navigation through really narrow channels and the water movements have pushed glaciers several meters up. The channels might really lead to open water again or end up getting the ship stuck in the ice. The captain is unsure what would be the best course to take.","804062":"Try to find the right path across the narrow channels","804063":"The captain is a true master of the Arctic. He compensates for the inaccuracy of the compass due to the closeness of the magnetic pole with a strong knowledge of the stars positions in this part of the world. He analyses the shapes of the glaciers and the position of the channels to deduce which routes has the most change to have an opening onto the sea. Take it, within a few hours the open sea is in sight.","804064":"With the magnetic pole being so close, the navigation instruments are not reliable anymore. The captain can only rely on his sense of orientation to pick the channels which should lead to the open sea.

Following the chosen channel over a few kilometres, their assumptions prove right. They go back to the ship to send the crew down the right path.","804079":"They were told to follow the channels so just do that. The men do not try to identify which is most likely to be the right one and disperse in smaller groups to cover as much ground as possible. Many days are lost waiting for all the patrols to come back empty-handed, unable to follow the channels to an end (more focus on their lack of ability to follow the channel, cant traverse the land, give up too early). The ship captain is forced to pick a channel randomly. Unfortunately the one he picked just hugs high instable glacier with no open sea in sight. Suddenly rumble, at starboard the glacier just under which the crew is about the pass by starts to collapse.","804080":"<b>It is clumsy.</b> Out of breath and struggling weakly against a strong current, your divers bludgeon blindly at the coral, sending clouds of particles up through the water.
