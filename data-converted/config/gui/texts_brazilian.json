I don't know what they are up to, but last time we did not act, things got nasty. I learned the hard way that in these situations its either them or us.","9546":"George Smith, a man I deeply respect for his actions, recently helped us out by sending a scout ship. He successfully identified La Corona were delivering weapons. Please make sure his efforts are not in vain.","9547":"I am very much against it, but I am afraid not giving in to the current request to take action against an La Corona ship visiting us, will cause internal conflict or even a division. One united movement will be required to win this battle.","9548":"Bente Jorgensen has her heart in the right place. She came here to help as soon as she heard of the situation. However, the poor thing has no idea what she is getting herself into. I don't want her to get involved.","9549":"The empire has been helping us out in secret. Another ship with supplies will soon arrive again, but La Corona have stepped up their presence in the area. I am afraid it will not reach us. ","9550":"Bad reputation. Parties located here are not friendly with you.","9551":"Good reputation. Parties located here are friendly with you.","9552":"An important, secret weapon delivery got disturbed by an inspection. The ones helping us were forced to drop the cargo overboard to not get into trouble themselves. Luckily I got word of the location. ","9553":"What is happening here in the region bothers me, more than you can imagine. But engaging in a battle we cannot yet win is not the way to go. These members of the movement tried and failed.

I want to have the wreckages of the ship analyzed to understand what we are currently up against.","9556":"La Corona complicate everything. These pigs think they own everything, even the region's waters. Just the other day they halted my shipment of trading supplies, and took it all.

How exciting! I am also preparing an expedition actually, and I need some timber to have the damage on my ship repaired. I can't risk sending out a damaged ship with so many lives on board.","9675":"I am glad to see you are doing so well! That ship should really help you. Right now you could use it to perform a good deed. I noticed a ship lose cargo just now, go and help them!","9676":"Even though you faced some rejection, don't feel down! You just have to stay positive and keep trying. What always helps me cheer up is helping others, maybe it works for you too. You could help out the orphanage!","9677":"So your father knew Isabel Sarmento too? I really look up to her and how she does everything she can to fight for the rights of the people. I prepared a ship to help, and I want to make sure it leaves safely. ","9678":"All this talk about social status. Although my advisors might care about these things, nothing changes for me, I always liked you. In fact, why don't we go for some sailing together, right now? ","9704":"All this talk about social status and what it means. Do you know what it really means? Absolutely nothing, all humans are useless creatures. I will let you experience how it means nothing first hand. I marked two ships of owners of different social status.","9705":"They turned you down, so what. You know, screw them, when I feel down, blowing things up makes me usually feel better. Why not get back at them while you are at it? Sink one of their deliveries, that should hurt them.","9706":"Isabel Sarmento huh, I don't care too much about what she wants and all that, but anyone fighting those Corona pigs gets my support. I have some unfinished business with them, so I will send a ship her way. ","9733":"So now you got a ship huh? I bet you couldn't even deliver wood to my harbour. I heard some rumors of how useless you are, and I am starting to think they might be true.","9734":"Oh? So you really managed to do something right. It still doesn't prove much, though. You will need to do a lot more to earn the respect of people like myself. You can start by bringing me some more materials.","9735":"I am not surprised people don't want to deal with you, you have no reputation to prove yourself after all. You should be thankful I am willing to give you work. Speaking of which, go pick up a delivery for me. ","9736":"The New World seems to be the talk of the day. I am sending a ship there too, and see what sort of beneficial deals I can get out of the locals. But some ex-trading partners of mine have been annoying me, so you are responsible for the safety of my ship.","9739":"The strength of the movement will only increase as we expand our territory. I have my eyes set on certain pieces of land, belonging to private owners. I will need a good amount of gold to compensate them. ","9744":"La Corona started rapidly construction a huge bridge. This bridge means they have a much stronger position, preventing it is our top priority. I already noticed several ships carrying materials, those are easy targets. ","9745":"I sent out a ship to gather information on La Corona and what their next move might be. I got word the ship returned with crucial information, and we can't afford to have it travel unguarded.","9746":"We managed to get these children away from La Corona. My harbor has been a safe haven for them, but they are still in the middle of conflict. They will travel to a safer place with this ship, and I want to ensure their safe leave. ","9748":"Oh, you've been preparing for an expedition? How exciting! In fact, I'm itching to set out again, but my ships need urgent repairs. Help a fellow pioneer in need?","9749":"The faster we're done, the sooner we can set out!","9752":"Thank you, fellow traveler! I'll steer clear of coral reefs this time.","9754":"Society is unforgiving with what to do and not do ... but it is most unforgiving to the poor and orphaned. Us oddballs can still help!","9755":"Don't let the sneering get you down!","9756":"The children are overjoyed! People are wrong about you.","9758":"It must be wonderful to be back on a ship! Now you can help people out even better - I heard a trader lost cargo just close to you!","9759":"A ship is indispensable when helping people!","9760":"You should have seen the look on the trader's face!","9762":"So you've heard of Isabel, the dreamy rebel leader? I so want to support her, can you escort my ship of supplies to her?","9763":"Isn't she heroic?","9764":"I'm sure this will bring the movement closer to victory!","9766":"My advisors finally came around to you, proclaiming things about standing ... but I've always liked you! Do you want to escape the fuss on a sailing trip?","9767":"I just told my advisors I'd step out for some fresh air!","9768":"And we didn't even need any standing for a lovely trip!","9770":"Where did you get a ship?! You look more like a deck-scrubber to me. Or can you disprove society rumours you're a worthless parasite? ","9771":"A ship, how?! The least you can do is serve me with it.","9772":"Amazing, you delivered wood. We're all so proud of you and your ship.","9773":"The rumour is true, you have no use. ","9774":"Independent Isabel makes exploitation of her people so hard, there must be something I can get them hooked on... ","9775":"Sarmento's Movement must be prone to vice, get to it!","9776":"They drown in schnapps, and I in money! ","9777":"You feeble lefty!","9778":"Surprised they reject you? A squit with not a gnat's cummerbund of reputability? Here's the sort of menial labour you were born to do...","9779":"Enjoy rejection while it lasts.","9780":"Down on your shins and thank me.","9781":"That's the last time I bother rejecting you!","9782":"Finally risen up to sour the cream of decent society? Look after my rich friends, or I'll ensure you never live it down.","9783":"Standing notwithstanding, you have it all to prove.","9784":"Licking boots won't get you up the ladder, you know. ","9785":"Society belches violently in your direction.","9786":"Isabel Sarmento is a simpering wisp. She needs fattening up if she is to play scapegoat on feast day. The day La Corona are massacred.","9787":"Isabel has need of our indulgence...","9788":"The turkey is plump, soon the feast can begin!","9789":"Perhaps you want to be sacrificed instead?","9790":"Proud of your standing, ehh, but what does it mean? A poor ship, an aristocrat ship. Destroy both, then come tell me how it help the aristocrats, ehh?","9791":"Show me, poor or rich, that they are equal in death.","9792":"Wolves are free from the leash to kill as they please.","9793":"Perhaps I can appreciate standing... on your tongue.","9794":"Rejection is your prison, but destruction the key to freedom. Realise violence, and imagine it is them you destroy. ","9795":"Come, let destruction release you!","9796":"Yes. Life is rejection, so reject life.","9797":"You have a sordid fetish for rejection.","9798":"Small Gift","9799":"Generous Gift","9800":"Lavish Gift","9801":"Pearls, I love threading them. However, my current supplier was acting up, so I told him that he is no longer needed. I want to show him my words have meaning, and that he truly is instantly replaceable.  ","9802":"Maintaining social contacts and status is very important, something you will learn at some point. For this reason I don't want to disappoint an old client, although I don't do these things myself anymore. ","9803":"Suhail Salim Rostamina, a Sheikh with great power and influence is visiting the region. We did some business before, but I want to further invest and refresh his memory. Make sure to mention Madame Kahina sent you!","9804":"I couldn't explain you why exactly, but an eerie feeling has been bothering me ever since this morning. I can't help but feel something bad is about to happen.","9805":"Looks like I have run out of Champagne. Don't you sometimes wonder how things would look if you made a different decision somewhere in the past? It's so fascinating how decisions result in chains of irreversible consequences.  ","9806":"Customers repeatedly ask me for these Pocket Watches. I don't exactly find them exotic, but seems that I might be able to make good money with them. I would like to try a sample batch. ","9807":"My next shipment will not be here for a while, and some of my stocks completely depleted. It would be foolish not to take money when I have the possibility to do so. ","9808":"An old friend in need reached out to me. He made a huge mistake; told the client it was done without confirming himself. Turns out the target is alive and well, here in the Old World. If the client finds out it could cost him his live. ","9809":"Under normal circumstances I would just feel sorry for these sad, petty criminals. but they decided to steal from one of my shipments this time around. If I would be dealing with it myself, I would cut off their hands. ","9810":"I recognized a ship as being part of the organization that once betrayed me. Its presence in the region might be a complete coincidence, but it might have come to track me down, a risk I am not willing to take. ","9811":"One could argue killing people is never a good thing, but I would say they are wrong. The jobs I took helped the world get rid of some terrible people.

Of the Timeless Timepiece","191540":"Marketplaces","250063":"You look idle, do this, would you?","250064":"So, you've managed to muddle through.","250065":"Fustilarian flea! Waste someone else's time!","250066":"No wonder your name is mud.","250067":"Dream of wide blue horizons? Apply within!","250068":"It feels special doing a good deed!","250069":"Oh really, you're as naughty as the children.","250070":"Failing is the only way we learn!","250072":"Some find it titillating to serve. Is that you?","250073":"My little errand boy, back with a happy face.","250074":"You drop from the flesh before feeding is done...","250075":"Humans are flawed.","250076":"We doubled our efforts!","250077":"Desperate to make something of yourself, I see.","250078":"On your head be it.","250079":"Your followers have nowhere to sleep, old pal!","250080":"So many are still loyal. But, will you stay loyal to them?","250081":"Wherever we've been, there was one constant: a marketplace. Where's yours?","250082":"Merchants, barter, pickpockets... The atmosphere improves already!","250083":"We've travelled often without roads, but don't deprive your people that comfort.","250084":"Much better to travel on.","250085":"If you want goods to reach their destinations, have them sprout wings! Or, lay roads.","250086":"I see you've chosen the down-to-earth approach, well done.","250087":"The railway could be a wonderful invention, if used right. Let's see how you do, old pal.","250088":"Curious, how close the distant is now.","250089":"Everything always starts with wood. Yet no production in sight here?","250090":"Saws are loud, but effective. You won't catch me near there.","250091":"I am unsure of these bags of meat, but that won't stop your people craving them.","250092":"Sausage is unsightly, but high in demand.","250093":"It's not for me, but strong drink is part of your culture. So, isn't something missing?","250094":"There is cheering on the streets. I suppose it was a good move.","250095":"Oh the stench! Won't you give your people something to wash themselves with?","250096":"A relief for my nostrils. Others feel the same, I can tell.","250097":"Have you forgotten all about life in land, old pal? Farmers need fields to sow!","250098":"CHANGE: So you do remember the basics.","250099":"It is your duty to care for the animals you keep. Why are they not given enough space?","250100":"Animals are God's creation. This should do right by them.","250101":"People here wash their clothes in wash houses, do they not? Where are those houses?","250102":"Fascinating gossip! All while meeting to wash clothes.","250103":"People here like to talk and drink. Give them a place to do it, not the streets!","250104":"Your people are lively every day of the week.","250105":"A mere spark can start a blaze! You might not want to think on that, but be at least prepared.","250106":"Let us hope it will never come to it again.","250107":"If only you had a material that could withstand storms and fires. If only!","250108":"I am proud you've figured out this secret material.","250109":"Do you want the people to go to work in their nightgowns? They need proper clothes for it!","250110":"Much better. Although the alternative would have been amusing.","250111":"Something the matter, old pal? You've almost revived your father's business, yet you hesitate.","250112":"You've come a long way.","250180":"Here's something even you can handle.","250181":"You can serve as the soot-stained stoker aboard my runaway train!","250182":"It's deeply trivial, but I dare say that won't bother you.","250183":"See how magnanimous I am, giving you work.","250184":"Don't keep me waiting.","250185":"It's an honour to serve a von Malching.","250187":"Not bad. I might use you again.","250188":"Are you sure that's everything? Very well.","250189":"Good, now scurry back to the sewer.","250190":"Now watch as I rake it all in!","250191":"Scrimshank pleb! Don't expect any favours from me.","250192":"Fluffed it? You zestless zounderkite!","250193":"Don't give me fimble-fambles, I deal in results.","250194":"What can possibly be the delay?","250195":"I'll have perished at this rate.","250196":"Where are you, dung-sifter?","250197":"Butter upon bacon, I have more for you …","250198":"There's no end to the profits in this.","250199":"I see a glimmer in this pan yet...","250200":"Surely you want to distance yourself from that simpleton?","250201":"Clearly not as distinguished a responsibility as this…","250229":"Von Malching is the name on everyone's lips at society gatherings.","250230":"I'd dress as your grandmother if it meant I could lay hands on your lovely lucre!","250231":"My business is other people's money. Your money, to be exact.","250232":"I shall capitalise on this.","250233":"Such juicy prospects.","250234":"Fizzing!","250235":"Very good for me.","250236":"The promise is ravishing!","250237":"That's good gravy!","250238":"Greatly to my advantage.","250239":"So, you can be useful.","250241":"I loathe to admit it, but you've done well.","250242":"Impressive, what's your secret? Not that I need it.","250243":"If you're happy with mediocre, then I'm happy too.","250244":"Well, bully for you!","250245":"Not entirely feeble. Not strong, but not feeble.","250246":"You might just be the best of a bad set.","250247":"I am vexed.","250248":"Confound this blasted matter.","250249":"This has upset my plans!","250250":"Absurd, I won't have it!","250251":"Nooooooooo!","250252":"Inconceivable!","250253":"What the devil?!","250257":"I expect no less, from a bluebottle.","250258":"Whenever it rains, you worm to the surface.","250262":"Your family crest is seething with rot!","250263":"You remind me of my father, spineless!","250264":"You handle this business like a guttersnipe.","250265":"You dare deny the cat his milk!","250266":"Your actions betray your commonness.","250267":"You're yet another mangy travelling circus, here today, gone tomorrow.","250269":"Don't expect me to shake your disease-ridden hand.","250272":"You, is it.","250274":"Oh I'm sorry, have we met?","250275":"Another interruption. Better be worth it.","250276":"What a deep voice I have. All the better to greet you with!","250277":"Want something, or simply admiring my realms?","250278":"Stumbling into the lion's jaws?","250279":"Good, then you know where the door is.","250280":"Don't loiter, you'll depreciate the value of this neighbourhood!","250282":"Keen to experience the dizzying razzle-dazzle of city life?","250283":"Ever seen a finer example than this? Of course you haven't.","250284":"Look upon the majesty, and weep.","250285":"Wish you had a vessel this stately do you?","250286":"I don't mind losing the odd sailor, as long as they bring in the bounty.","250287":"I associate boats with treasure.","250288":"We're looking for a deck-scrubber, since you like boats so much.","250289":"I deserve this.","250290":"Capital.","250291":"Bang up to the elephant.","250292":"Oh if I must.","250293":"Only because it suits me.","250294":"Alright.","250295":"An emphatic no!","250296":"Certainly not!","250297":"Has the world gone loopy?","250301":"The brutes are rich, and the meek impoverished, all is as it should be in the world!","250302":"My factories use every part of the pig but the squeal. Squeamish workers can be found other situations!","250303":"I sometimes feel for the little people; too busy working to earn any money.","250304":"I held a modest function for society's distinguished. A five-course dinner, a masquerade, a forty-piece orchestra, rose petals billowing from the rafters. Maybe I'll invite you next time, but then... maybe not.","250305":"Some were born, silver spoon in mouth. Once I'd wrenched it from father's feeble grasp that is.","250306":"Miss Jorgensen is an intriguing creature. Naïve, but of good blood. Once she replies to my offer of marriage, we shall breed children of ambition and status.","250307":"Since Miss Qing is rather new, I'll show her the lay of the land. Then have first dibs on her eastern fortune!","250308":"Beryl O'Mara clings to society like a leech. Her chief of police should arrest her where she stands.","250309":"Why do they celebrate that fop Gasparov at the club? All he does is blither about buttresses!","250310":"Why is it prattlers like Wibblesock are always so insistent?! Does the dratted imbecile never sleep?!","250311":"George Smith's hard life, blah-blah-blah. Haven't I had to struggle!? A name in tatters, and yet now, across everybody's lips!","250313":"Graves?! The mutation? The model of maleficence?! The ripper who robbed the barber?","250314":"Vicente Silva has had an easy life; anybody in his boots would have succeeded. I meanwhile, rise to prominence on merit!","250315":"When Lady Hunt invited me in for afternoon tea, I felt an unspoken bond between us. Sophistication!","250316":"The Queen is fond of me, and vice-versa. But her administration is a scandal! I demand a barony!","250317":"Archie Blake is a sniveller. He somehow cosied up to the Queen, and has remained an obsequious parasite ever since.","250324":"We won't shake on it, you probably spit on your hands.","250325":"I pity you, is why I indulge you.","250326":"I'm a philanthropist.","250327":"Trade can be so demeaning.","250328":"And despite a yawning gulf in status.","250329":"Noblesse oblige!","250330":"Regard my largesse!","250361":"My lavish offer.","250362":"Take it or leave it.","250363":"It's as low as I will stoop.","250364":"Read while I floss my moustache.","250365":"Me at my most generous.","250366":"You don't deserve better than this …","250367":"Don't waste my time with counter-offers!","250368":"I am a wolf, and you, a sheep come to dinner.","250369":"I'll scrape off your carapace you wood weevil!","250370":"I long to burst you like a bubo.","250371":"I have you between my fat palms ready to squish.","250372":"Quite reasonable, considering ...","250373":"Don't mind if I do.","250374":"What a steal!","250375":"See! I'm no miser!","250376":"A most favourable result.","250377":"Putrescent pinchfist!","250378":"And sign my life away?!","250379":"You stiff-neck scrooge!","250380":"A scandalous offer!","250381":"Skinflint!","250382":"I'll be the one who does the exploiting!","250383":"The fat needs trimming.","250384":"As I want it, or not at all…","250385":"You deranged rhinoceros!","250386":"This deal is good for me in any case.","250387":"Meal-mouth fitch.","250388":"I've seen scarier chipmunks.","250389":"Please, don't make me laugh!","250390":"What will you do? Pepper me with haberdasher's buttons?","250391":"You'll appreciate this.","250392":"Let me help you.","250393":"Here's charity.","250394":"No need to thank me.","250395":"And they say I'm unkind...","250396":"Well, what did you expect?!","250397":"Eat humble pie.","250398":"You pushed me to this.","250399":"You deserve even worse.","250400":"Let me put you in your place.","250401":"I wage war against you and your pigeon-liver plebs.","250402":"A war with you is a surefire investment.","250403":"House von Malching goes to war!","250404":"This war is a waste of time for both of us.","250405":"What if I were to let you off the hook?","250406":"Better let you catch your breath.","250407":"Towel off the sweat while you may.","250408":"It will help your exiguous business along.","250409":"I don't expect this favour will be repaid.","250410":"You would be joining an elite club.","250411":"You never had anything I needed.","250412":"We always throw your junk into the sea.","250413":"Why I degraded myself to your level...!","250418":"Who would decline a match with a von Malching?","250419":"A most illustrious alliance, surely?","250420":"I am so tired of pretending to care about you.","250421":"We are patently not on the same footing.","250427":"Take it. I hardly need it.","250428":"Had it coming out of my ears - wax free, of course.","250429":"Here is a token gift.","250435":"I'm here if ever you need a steady, albeit somewhat arthritic, hand to guide you.","250436":"Sir Archibald Blake, Her Majesty's moist mouthpiece!","250437":"One-piece underwear suits? Too prickly! I find singleton shorts and vests to be tried and true!","250438":"For once something you've done makes sense.","250439":"That's not a terrible idea.","250440":"Oh, yes...","250441":"Most promising.","250442":"Surprisingly shrewd ...","250443":"Vagabond!","250444":"Tatterdemalion!","250445":"A bold-faced swindle!","250446":"The impudence!","250447":"A low-life move.","250448":"By Jove, you're a maniac!","250449":"Your paper tigers will be blown to the winds.","250450":"War? All too obvious, you sneeze-lurking snake.","250451":"Finally worked out who's best?","250452":"I suppose I could spare you ...","250453":"I could have batty-fanged you to bits.","250454":"Yes, I do think you need time to recuperate.","250455":"Fine, though I doubt you have anything tradeworthy.","250456":"I keenly await your first shipment of soiled 'k'chiefs.","250457":"Trade with you? Lucky me.","250458":"No more of your junk? Say it's not true!","250459":"Finally we can be rid of your detritus!","250460":"Yes, go back to the foot of the pyramid.","250465":"Certainly I can be a friend, at least on paper.","250466":"Dry your eyes, I will be your ally.","250467":"Weaselling your way out?","250468":"Sloping your shoulders?","250475":"More money is always good.","250476":"Never look a gift donkey in the chops.","250479":"Weird and wonderful!","250482":"I'm sure ma'am shall be delighted!","250483":"Superlative!","250484":"Suitably regal!","250485":"Her Majesty might approve!","250486":"Comforting as a moist and springy sponge!","250487":"Well that certainly settles the stomach!","250489":"You're a credit to the Empire!","250490":"You're constant, and that is key!","250491":"Perhaps a peerage is on the cards?","250492":"Majesty will soon be mentioning you.","250493":"I knew you'd come through!","250494":"You're flourishing!","250495":"You're a national treasure!","250496":"Her Majesty will be discomfited…","250497":"There's an unpleasant waft in the air.","250498":"Heavens, what shall I tell her majesty?","250499":"Oh, horsefeathers.","250500":"This brings on my indigestion.","250501":"I'm suddenly hot under the collar.","250502":"Pshaw, I shan't sleep at all.","250503":"You put me in a difficult position…","250504":"I wouldn't wish to accuse you of disloyalty…","250505":"Perhaps think again on the situation?","250506":"I fear you've made things awkward…","250507":"Might I advise against your current course?","250508":"Now we don't want to have a contretemps.","250509":"It's not that we don't trust you entirely…","250511":"I present my humble duty to you, and am confident you'll transcend your present circumstance!","250512":"I am a humble servant of Her Majesty, called upon for delicate occasions such as these.","250513":"Taking the initiative - excellent!","250514":"What a jolly jolly surprise.","250515":"Ah yes, the bright young sapling!","250516":"I present my humble duty to you.","250517":"Don't tell me I've missed another appointment?","250518":"Sir Archibald Blake, how may I serve?","250519":"Anyone for croquet?","250520":"I've always dreamed of being loathed!","250521":"Au contraire! There is nothing more in fashion than the monocle!","250522":"Your guttural babble sloshes like water off a duck's back!","250523":"The wayward jabs of your sabre are foiled by your lack of poise.","250524":"What sticky drippy honey goop!","250525":"Damn liberal! Control your peculiar thoughts!","250526":"What a fawning cod you have turned out to be.","250527":"Your toadyism is thoroughly nauseating!","250528":"Lies and slander! My wife died in a curricle accident!","250529":"I am nothing like my idiot father! You calumniating imp!","250530":"What's wrong with my moustache?!","250531":"Oh, yes. Couldn't have said it better myself.","250532":"Thank you! Pleasingly round isn't it?","250533":"Very true! They are extremely shiny.","250534":"I know your game of billiards, but don't let me stop you.","250538":"I'm glad of our trade, most are too dazzled by me to even approach.","250539":"I rarely circulate among minnows, yet we've done a few deals.","250540":"The little piglet that keeps coming back to the teat, its adorable.","250541":"We prepare for the worst but hope for the best.","250542":"Our humble little Empire.","250543":"The King is dead, long live the Queen!","250544":"The street layout was positively Byzantine until recent times.","250545":"I AM a real baron, I tell you!","250546":"Her Majesty's finest!","250547":"A lustrous jewel in the crown!","250548":"Every ship needs a stiff rudder!","250549":"An Empire covers both land AND sea!","250550":"Ma'am and I are much obliged!","250551":"A royal acknowledgement is due!","250552":"Sir Archibald gives his thanks.","250553":"Naturally!","250557":"But of course!","250559":"Oh, most assuredly!","250572":"I bought some of your island. The door was open, and I ambled through.","250573":"Hardly worth investing in your island, but then, it won't be yours for long.","250574":"A delicious morsel. Soon I shall have the lion's share.","250575":"It can be mine now. All mine.","250576":"I have so many grand plans for it…","250577":"A completely insignificant island, no wonder you're so keen to buy!","250578":"You can afford to tussle for my island? Perhaps I underestimated you.","250579":"Only a fastidious cove thinks they can buy their way in!","250580":"You think you've outmanoeuvred me!","250581":"Defraud me of an entire island?!","250582":"Sad you lack the acumen to see the potential of this land.","250583":"What kind of apple-polisher gives up an island?","250586":"You only have it because I let you have it!","250587":"You do the hard work developing it, and then I'll take it back.","250590":"You philistine! All my hard work gone from that island.","250591":"You erased every trace of von Malching from it?! Savage!","250592":"Razed every brick I laid? You are possessed by sadistic demons!","250593":"I fear that may be impossible.","250594":"The thought makes me wince!","250595":"Oh my aching organs, no.","250596":"As a boy, I was chased through the palace by a disgruntled goose, honking and hissing! I had its egg, you see. Once I'd given it back, the goose and I became firm friends.","250597":"Tolerance, sympathy, understanding. Supreme qualities in a monarch wishing for a happy reign.","250598":"Her Majesty rarely needs guidance - ah, a little here and there - I think she simply likes to have my company.","250599":"Ever carved a lovespoon from walnut? I did have an amour once, but matters of state drew us apart.","250600":"As Her Majesty's adjutant, I must be quietly attentive. The merest smile on her face is enough!","250601":"Viscount Guffington-Hawkmoth, wounded at his own estate. It brings to light Her Majesty's very present vulnerability.","250602":"Bless Her Majesty, she eats so fast, but when she stops, so must we!","250605":"Her Majesty's rare gift is a soft heart and a hard mind. With monarchs, it is too often the reverse!","250606":"Anne Harlow's fall from grace was stormy and unpleasant, a bit like my bowels.","250607":"George Smith has a marvellous walking cane of alder, with tasteful silver flourishes.","250608":"Aha...Jean La Fortune. We'd like to have helped, but it's rather gone beyond that now.","250609":"Isabel Sarmento? You should probably be careful where you speak that name.","250610":"Mr. Bleakworth may seem a blinkered horse, but is very well-suited to his task at the prison.","250611":"When running errands for Her Majesty, I often find myself in Madame Kahina's exquisite company.","250612":"Miss Jorgensen is a far relation of Her Majesty, if I'm not mistaken. They do both share a certain boldness...","250613":"We have made every conceivable dispensation for Princess Qing, as we are compelled to do with visiting royalty!","250614":"We auditioned this Wibblesock for Her Majesty's fifteenth birthday, sadly the rabbit didn't survive the hat.","250615":"Beryl O'Mara has flies on the wall, as I only dream our own discrete services might.","250616":"Her Majesty wearies of Mr. von Malching's pinguid claims to a non-existent barony.","250617":"I worry Artur Gasparov might one day appear at the palace better-dressed than her majesty.","250620":"I'll smithereen you!","250621":"Lowly cur!","250622":"Have at you, devil-dog!","250623":"I'm positively bristling!","250624":"I am suddenly violent!","250625":"You wild beast!","250626":"You vindictive menace!","250627":"Your fleet is a rabble!","250628":"Plebs are not at liberty to joust!","250629":"Knave!","250630":"Oh dear, did your stock plummet?","250631":"I shall sweep your wreck for treasure!","250632":"Your tin-pot tars left clinging to driftwood!","250633":"That ship cost me an arm and a leg!","250634":"My ship! You electric eel!","250635":"Where did you find such firepower?","250636":"I should have charged the spectators!","250637":"It gave way so easily!","250638":"Have you any idea how much that cost?","250639":"That will be sickeningly expensive to replace!","250640":"Look at my winning smile!","250641":"It's my island now. Time to exploit the dissidents!","250642":"Oh no. Looks like I've trampled over you on my way to the top of the pile.","250643":"Nowhere left to run for the von Malching line.

I told 'em, cheeky lad, they must have thought, but a talent!","251347":"A lot of it is pure Wibblyism, just ignore it. Unless you're a Wibblyist as well?","251348":"I know what hard work is. Never had to do it meself...but I've an idea of it, like.","251349":"Wibble Soc is a society of trickery and legerdemain. I am its principal, everywhere and nowhere at once!","251350":"The apparition! Always there in me mind's dreams. It whispers gravely, 'give me back that money you nit.'","251351":"I see it now. I am a vessel of 'occult forces', imbued with the untold power of gold.","251353":"No shame in a name like Wibblesock.

The board have put in a veto.","251361":"Lovely Lady Hunt reminds me of my old mum, looking down, thinking, how did he do so well?","251362":"Oooh that Malching! I've had him an' his furry door-knocker in my dreams, telling me what I ain't.","251363":"Bente I adore thee, like a rose what smells lovely. One day I'll o'erstride, the darn class divide, and we'll uncork a bottle o' bubbly.","251364":"Don't make me say Alonso's name, please! He puts the willies up old Willie.","251365":"Vicente Silva's a bit of an 'awkins, eh? Never takes time to say hello.","251366":"I'm not sure old George can hear a word anyone says. Nothing I say, anyway!","251367":"She can be mean Beryl. Reminds me a bit of mum though, which is nice.","251368":"Artur's like a hall o' mirrors. I feel lost around him.","251369":"I love the Queen, love her, love her, love her, dunno why but I do!","251370":"Maybe it was Lafortune's treasure I..came by that baleful day.","251371":"Eli makes me uncomfortable. Not that I've done anything wrong, I mean...","251372":"Madame Kahina is very very wise.

Work your way up from that dirty bottom!","251391":"Look into my eyes, you are feeling sleepy...and very helpful.","251392":"Punctual please, I do have a pocket-watch?","251393":"Let's see what you conjure up!","251394":"I'm not as scary as you thought, eh!","251395":"I need a little sit down.","251396":"Yes, of course.","251397":"But—I'm so nice??","251398":"I'd rather thank you than spank you.","251399":"Who's the father!","251400":"My talent is already rubbing off on you!","251401":"Oh Yes! Yes! Yes!","251402":"I was fairly sure you'd die doing that!","251404":"Almost fell for that one!","251405":"Ooh! I'll be just as daring and refuse!","251406":"Don't be silly! You're not the sort to be malicious!","251407":"Let down. Again.","251408":"Bite off the hand that feeds you?!","251409":"Aw! I can't get anybody to do it!","251411":"Would you Adam and Eve it.","251412":"I won't tell you again, it's not good enough.","251413":"Ever help a magician before? 'Cos you're not helping one now.","251414":"How would you like it if I kept you waiting?","251415":"Where's your magic touch?","251416":"Oi! Everything's on hold 'til you get back!","251417":"There's plenty more where that came from!","251418":"We're sitting on a gold mine, so keep digging!","251419":"People don't hate you so much if you keep doing things for 'em.","251422":"I can rescind wizard memberships you know!","251423":"I've never asked you for nothing 'til now!","251447":"Tell you wot, how about this?","251448":"I worked some magic for us.","251449":"You'd be doing me a heck of a turn.","251450":"Let me practice me stage patter…","251451":"Do us a favour would'ya?","251452":"Sleight of hand, that is my province!","251453":"More than reasonable, I'd say…","251454":"Right! I've heard enough of your lip.","251455":"I have got quite a hard punch y'know.","251456":"I'm gonna tickle all the ivories in your bone box!","251457":"You are treading on dodgy water!","251458":"Keep it on the nudge-nudge, eh?","251459":"Were it up to me, this'd be a different deal.","251460":"Alright just for you.

That sort of togetherness is going to be vital.","254639":"I vow to return to the Arctic next spring, braver and stronger for our failure.","254640":"The Arctic Council show no sign of completing the task they have begun.","254644":"The Inuit are witness to this white expanse, they must know something of the expedition.","254645":"Had we listened to the Inuit sooner, the lost might already be found.","254646":"Ordinary ships cannot breach the ancient ice.

I hope that will not be our last chance.","254654":"HMS Hades and Styx came this way, if it takes our last breath we must find them.","254655":"What does it take for a captain to abandon his ship? To go on by foot.","254662":"A thousand letters from your father go unopened, yet one scribble from your sister changes everything? I didn't even know you had a sister!","254663":"So this is it. We're leaving paradise behind. You never talked much about family and the like, but you’re dead serious about this, aren’t you? No matter, I made a vow to defend you. And I don't break an oath, even if a blind man could see you’re leaping into the deepest pit of dung.","254664":"I have never asked anything of you, firstborn.

trust you.","256446":"Do I really have conviction in you?","256447":"Something about you still gives my people hope.","256448":"Dealing with you could be a lottery.","256449":"Little fish are careful

What of it...?","258497":"We usually meet by the light of the moon.","258498":"That just makes you fair game again, right boys?","258499":"Whatsay we come for your goods just the same?","258500":"Makes no odds to us how you want to be stung.","258501":"A fellow outcast eh? I'll be the judge of that.","258502":"Ye will never last with ol' Annie.","258503":"I knew you wouldn't stick it with us for long.","258504":"We prefer our own company anyway.","258508":"None of that pity, just the laying down of arms.","258509":"I don't expect you'll show mercy.","258510":"Trade us in, and we'll box you good and proper.","258511":"We pirates have special terms.","258512":"Willing to pay the price?","258513":"From now on, you'll stay away, d'yer hear?","258514":"Deal with my men again and I'll cut you a smile.","258515":"Haven't you heard? Pirates never barter!","258516":"Not 'cos we want to, 'cos we have to.","258517":"On one condition; you're still not a pirate.","258518":"Finally got you off our backs.","258519":"Good news, we don't need you any more.","258520":"Don't think you'll be getting any more.","258521":"This is an exception!","258522":"We'll have it back soon enough.","258523":"Don't waste yer effort, we're dead already.","258524":"Then a tiny independent nation rises proudly above the sea of injustice.","258525":"I'd gamble on me too, there's a bet I know I can't lose.","258526":"Then the die is cast. Our people have everything to fight for.","258527":"Better keep a poker face.","258528":"Bondye Bon.","258529":"The odds are in our favour.","258530":"Shows we're right to be persistent.","258531":"These moments are almost worth the struggle.","258532":"Something good to tell my little girl.","258533":"Bull's eye.","258534":"Don't waste that acumen of yours.","258535":"You might be bona fide after all.","258536":"You're good!","258537":"Look at you swagger!","258538":"I know you must be a libertarian deep down.","258539":"It's easy to get drawn in by you.","258540":"Are you finally embracing a just cause?","258541":"Things are hard enough as it is!","258542":"What am I going to tell my wife and daughter?","258543":"We don't need any more misfortune!","258544":"We just going to have to endure this.","258545":"Some hands you have to live with.","258546":"We're not ones to fold, no matter what!","258547":"Only a coward would give in now.","258548":"I don't think you're genuine.","258549":"You know, I scarcely need agitating.","258550":"So snake eyes, is that how it is?","258551":"Always did have you down as a despot.","258552":"What have you done?!","258553":"I'd hate to punish you, but if that's what it takes.","258554":"I've tried everything with you…","258555":"Thank the Almighty.","258556":"I'm grateful.","258557":"Lord knows we needed it.","258558":"As you wish.","258559":"Wi.","258560":"We're fine with it.","258561":"Non.","258562":"No dice.","258563":"When chicks teethe.","258570":"Let's both take a step back for a moment.","258571":"Some of us need time to regroup!","258572":"Oh, are we still fighting?","258573":"This should be a land of free and fair trade.","258574":"You can't afford to miss opportunities here.","258575":"We will be a respected trading nation like the rest.","258576":"Our terms of trade were a joke from the beginning.","258577":"There's no benefit to us in working with you.","258578":"We've got our own economy now.","258579":"No need for animosity, why don't we help each other?","258580":"I promise not to back out at the crucial moment.","258581":"I don't think you have my people's interests at heart.","258582":"You know, we do pretty well on our own.","258583":"A token of my people's good will.","258584":"Share and share alike, I say.","258585":"What can I say, I'm the giving type.","258587":"You're right, we need some perspective.","258588":"I also have my wife and children to think about.","258589":"Of course, we're always interested in commerce.","258590":"Well why wouldn't you trade with us?","258591":"What could possibly go wrong!","258592":"It's ok, we don't have to deal.","258593":"Strike out alone, I won't be a hypocrite.","258594":"Maybe its better we do our own thing.","258595":"I look forward to working with you.","258596":"An alliance built to last.","258597":"We all have our reasons, don't let me stop you.","258598":"No need to apologise, I understand.","259748":"To work with the lowest, yet answer only to God and the Queen. How many can say that?","259749":"Surely the choice is black and white, what with my clean record executing justice.","259750":"It's not my job to know their crimes, only to find a fitting punishment.","259751":"Everything seems in order.","259752":"I see no crime in this.","259753":"All running like clockwork.","259754":"Duty has its rewards.","259755":"A break from hard labour.","259756":"A light through the bars!","259757":"No less than is deserved.","259758":"Excellent.","259759":"Whatever your methods, you hide them well.","259760":"You run a tight ship.","259761":"I attest to your probity.","259762":"You execute well.","259763":"Your techniques are efficient.","259764":"Exemplary conduct.","259765":"This warrants an inquiry!","259766":"Someone will hang for this.","259767":"Criminal.","259768":"Never would have passed on my watch.","259769":"Everything, everyone, is suspect.","259770":"I will raise an injunction!","259771":"It's misery by proxy.","259772":"Your negligence is criminal.","259773":"Careful you don't end up on my island.","259774":"So you were the perpetrator!","259775":"If you aren't with me, villain…","259776":"You tread a very thin line.","259777":"Fall foul of me, and fall foul of sovereign law.","259778":"Don't expect to get off scot-free.","259779":"Justice served.","259780":"Community service is it?","259781":"That's the least I'm due for my suffering.","259782":"If we must.","259783":"I permit it.","259784":"Seems legitimate.","259787":"Not interested.","259788":"Nix to it!","259789":"I'm going to have to shut it off.","259791":"If you're after something unique, you can expect to pay for it.","259792":"The Emporium Exotique doesn't open its doors to just anyone you know.","259793":"You're looking for something, and I can help you find it.","259794":"Isn't that a curiosity.","259795":"Intriguing.","259796":"What an exciting turn.","259797":"This is turning into quite a story.","259798":"Exhilarating.","259799":"So, the secret's out.","259800":"A good outcome.","259801":"Maybe I was wrong about you.","259802":"You've got my attention.","259803":"What a killer instinct.","259804":"There's merchant in you.","259805":"You can be quite cutthroat.","259806":"You've rocked the apple cart.","259807":"I like the way you set out your stall.","259808":"What a surprise.","259809":"Just as expected.","259810":"And life once seemed so thrilling.","259811":"Typical.","259812":"What a tangle.","259813":"I anticipated that.","259814":"Disappointing.","259815":"You'll have to do better than that.","259816":"That's your best offer?","259817":"Are you wasting my time?","259818":"You need to be more ruthless.","259819":"Not much in the way of business sense.","259820":"I've seen some stupid things…","259821":"Oh you're not another one of those…","259822":"Maybe I shouldn't insist on working alone.","259823":"I'm grateful but I won't lower my prices.","259824":"This favour will repay itself in other ways.","259825":"Interesting, very well.","259826":"Sounds tempting enough.","259827":"Agreed.","259828":"I'm not interested.","259829":"My days of risk-taking are over.","259830":"I might have agreed to that once, not any more.","259831":"Of course we will take a stand beside you, if you are for freedom and justice!","259832":"Now is the time for choosing sides. Just or unjust.","259833":"We join on one condition, that like you we are free to write our own history.","259834":"We can build on this.","259835":"It is good news.","259836":"Let's take nothing for granted.","259837":"This is progress at least.","259838":"We are all the stronger for this.","259839":"A small win, but we'll take it.","259840":"A flicker of hope.","259841":"Champion of the underdog!","259842":"I wanted to believe you'd come through.","259843":"It takes courage to make a stand.","259844":"I was right to trust you.","259845":"Your heart is in the right place.","259846":"You have achieved a lot.","259847":"May there be more good news from you.","259848":"It is only a setback.","259849":"We will come back stronger.","259850":"Nothing we aren't ready for.","259851":"We can't give up.","259852":"This cannot be allowed to harm our plans.","259853":"We can find a way around this.","259854":"We've seen worse.","259855":"You should have more faith.","259856":"Are you crazy?","259857":"I thought we had trust.","259858":"You will expose us.","259859":"I don't want to cut ties with you.","259860":"Ask youself, whose side are you on?","259861":"Don't burn all your bridges.","259862":"We won't forget this.","259863":"I am so happy someone could help us.","259864":"Words can't express how grateful we are.","259865":"We could use a distraction.","259866":"We can make it work.","259867":"It is a risk worth taking.","259868":"There must be a better way.","259869":"There is no time for this.","259870":"This will not help our struggle.","259872":"It makes one feel frisky and alive!","259873":"We ARE amused!","259874":"This suits us very well.","259875":"How wonderful to have it our own way!","259876":"How mischievous one feels!","259877":"It has all gone off very satisfactorily!","259878":"All is much as it should be.","259879":"Be strong in business, and become a pillar of our nation.","259880":"You continue to be of the greatest use to us.","259881":"Your successes must be a source of pride.","259882":"We appreciate your efforts.","259883":"Parliament commends you exceedingly.","259884":"You slide easily about the board like the rook!","259885":"You are a very able servant of the realm.","259886":"We are not amused!","259887":"The Queen regrets this distressing affair.","259888":"Another Queen may have turned to execution by now.","259889":"It is gravely injurious to our nation.","259890":"One wants prompt action against such outrage.","259891":"It is a time of discord for those of my station.","259892":"One of the many threats to my position.","259893":"The Queen finds your conduct inexcusable!","259894":"My father would have had you executed!","259895":"You WILL do better!","259896":"What a perilously selfish subject you are!","259897":"Your Queen is displeased with you.","259898":"Parliament will discuss what shall be done with you.","259899":"Tantamount to treason!","259900":"Then we owe our gratitude.","259901":"It is much admired.","259902":"Sincere thanks for attending to this matter.","259903":"It would be prudent to accept.","259904":"Oh, we are only too happy to agree.","259905":"We shall be delighted.","259906":"Shame Queens can't chop heads anymore.","259907":"Heaven forbid!","259908":"If that is a joke, it is not a funny one.","259909":"Yer a canny herring!","259910":"Yer know the ropes!","259911":"The crew come 'round to you.","259912":"Kelpie-blood in yer veins!","259913":"I know a sea-soul when I see one!","259914":"All at sea!","259915":"Years at sea, never sank this low.","259916":"May as well be sunk!","259917":"A most uneven keel!","259918":"The worst things happen at sea!","259919":"Yer aff yer head!","259920":"Drag us down with yer, eh?!","259921":"You'd have us piss in the wind!","259922":"You seem a loose cannon.","259923":"I won't say 'mutiny', Admiral.","259924":"I'll steer ye from here to the precipice, the edge of the world!","259925":"I'll cap'n for ye, til blood boil or freeze in my veins.","259928":"Pumping pistons!","259929":"No flies on me.","259930":"I'm over the moon.","259931":"I'm lighter than air.","259932":"I'd be blown away, if not for me ropes…","259933":"Whizbang!","259934":"Soaring like a buzzard.","259935":"You're flying!","259936":"Self-propelled, I see.","259937":"You make silk purses from sow's ears.","259938":"Sift and you will find.","259939":"You've got a spark.","259940":"Something always drops from the pipe with you.","259941":"Rubbish!","259942":"Fly-blown frass!","259943":"It unhinges me!","259944":"Soiled my day.","259945":"Bahhh!","259946":"Hollow piles o' dung.","259947":"I haven't time for this!","259948":"You're dynamite!","259949":"You're cranking my crank.","259950":"Don't ratchet me temper!","259951":"I'll 'ave yer bones!","259952":"I've a bone to pick with you.","259953":"Yer damp and dirty drape.","259954":"Yer smudge-pot.","259955":"Oily little toerag.","259956":"How touching.","259957":"I'm a grateful sackful.","259958":"Tinker very much.","259959":"I'm in.","259960":"Could be worse I s'pose.","259961":"Then what we waitin' for, let's get stuck in.","259962":"I won't be manipulated.","259963":"What's in it for me?","259964":"Gorr, take me for an idiot?","259965":"Where are my charts?","259966":"Preparation!","259967":"It's sextant time.","259968":"Let's extend the old telescope.","259969":"Time to rummage in the old sea chest.","259970":"Thank the Admiral.","259971":"Takes a lot to sway an old dog.","259972":"Me heart swells like the surf.","259973":"Aye, aye!","259974":"If the Admiral commands it!","259975":"Full steam ahead.","259976":"So be it!","259977":"Make it so!","259978":"As sure as the tide.","259979":"We do as commanded.","259980":"That we shall!","259981":"Nay, I cannae!","259982":"Enough, no more!","259983":"Damned if I will!","259984":"And all because of me.","259985":"And I was always so overlooked!","259986":"Not everyone is born for success.","259987":"They must now see it was I who turned out best.","259988":"I was always the dutiful child, the good child.","259989":"Finally, after all I've suffered.","259990":"Proof I should have been the one chosen.","259991":"You'll never be special, you know.","259992":"Heavens, you think this makes you a Goode?","259993":"Helpful or not, your presence is unwelcome.","259994":"Nothing you do will lift the cloud.","259995":"It's the least you could do.","259996":"Your father would be proud.","259997":"Perhaps now you'll leave me in peace e'gad.","259998":"Things never go without a hiccup, do they?!","259999":"This is folly!","260000":"Every time I have to play second fiddle!","260001":"What is the meaning of this!?","260002":"Why do I deserve to suffer!","260003":"It was agreed this matter would be settled!","260004":"I am more than capable of dealing with this!","260005":"Isn't it obvious? Everything is your fault.","260006":"Our family should have disowned you long ago.","260007":"Why couldn't you stay away?","260008":"This is all your doing.","260009":"Wastrel.","260010":"You always were a disappointment.","260011":"You have no inkling of this business!","260012":"Don't expect gratitude.","260013":"Oh thank heaven.","260014":"Sweet mercy.","260015":"See, I'm not afraid to take a calculated risk.","260016":"Why would there be a problem?","260017":"Why should I have compunctions about it?","260018":"I have decided otherwise!","260019":"Don't tell me what to do!","260020":"There will be no negotiation!","260021":"You do have a ship, Admiral?","260022":"Perhaps some form of sea craft?","260023":"We'll need the finest ship!","260024":"Where is she, let me see her!","260025":"What have yer christened her?","260026":"Something to keep us going, Admiral?","260027":"No provisions?!","260028":"On biscuit alone?","260029":"What of supplies?","260030":"I'd take anything I could just now.","260031":"Isn't she running a little light?!","260032":"We'll be taking a chance, Admiral.","260033":"I don't know if she's up to this!","260034":"Better hope she has spirit.","260035":"We'll have to take your word.","260036":"I suppose she'll do.","260037":"Not the worst manifest.","260038":"We're adequately stocked.","260039":"She's set fair enough.","260040":"I can't make any promises.","260041":"Ready as she'll ever be!","260042":"She's an honour to command, Admiral.","260043":"Rigged to succeed.","260044":"She's beautifully fitted.","260045":"Stacked in our favour.","260046":"Nothing to fear.","260048":"I am somewhat heartened.","260052":"High spirits.","260053":"Ready for anything.","260054":"Wind's in our sails","260055":"It'll be a breeze!","260056":"Plain sailing!","260057":"Seen better odds, and worse.","260058":"How many lives have we left?","260059":"I am more hopeful than I was.","260060":"All seems well for now.","260061":"Signs are more encouraging.","260062":"Times must be good.","260063":"I shouldn't complain at times like these.","260064":"All quite bearable.","260065":"I wouldn't like to wager.","260066":"Stick or twist?","260067":"It's your call, Admiral.","260068":"Only fate truly knows.","260069":"Only the wind can say.","260070":"Put more skulls on the pile?","260071":"A sword hangs above us.","260072":"Turn about, before it's too late.","260073":"All I can do is to warn you.","260074":"If doom it must be, we will follow.","260075":"I'm happy for you, really I am.","260076":"You might feel rather pleased with yourself.","260077":"You've kept things in good order.","260078":"No-one can begrudge your achievements.","260079":"You have not been unsuccessful!","260080":"Your dedication is commendable.","260081":"You work with reassuring method.","260082":"This grim monotony is worse than life.","260083":"I should like to be someone else.","260084":"Sigh...","260085":"I find this all so trivial.","260086":"How dull.","260087":"I want to feel something, just not irritable!","260088":"I'm tired of being tired.","260089":"You give me no comfort at present.","260090":"I worried you might be this sort of person.","260091":"You forget yourself.","260092":"A quaint interpretation of precision.","260093":"When you overlook minutiaie, things go awry.","260094":"And it's all the harder when one is alone!","260095":"It's a disordered tangle of briar.","260096":"What luxury!","260097":"Most cordial!","260098":"We feel most welcome","260099":"What a breath of fresh air.","260100":"How agreeable.","260101":"You inspire something in me.","260102":"Courteous from the moment we arrived.","260103":"Aren't you most accommodating.","260104":"You make for a charming host.","260105":"People must look up to you greatly.","260106":"This is not what was promised.","260107":"This is not as advertised!","260108":"The brochure was misleading!","260109":"We paid an awful lot to come here.","260110":"I may just catch the next boat home.","260111":"What a way for you to treat a guest.","260112":"You are a monstrous host.","260113":"Are you the manager?!","260114":"Are you responsible for this predicament?","260115":"You make things extraordinarily inconvenient!","260116":"I've finally arrived! Now to see if the journey was worth it.","260117":"Finally terra firma! I cannot wait to look around and explore.","260118":"Lovely day for seafront perambulation!","260119":"I'm writing a postcard - Ahem - just need someone to deliver it?","260120":"My portmanteau has spilled out everywhere!","260121":"Oh! Do you have a luncheon recommendation?","260122":"Good thing you caught me, we are about to take tea!","260128":"And at no additional cost?","260129":"What an unexpected treat!","260130":"Oh, much obliged!","260131":"When in Rome!","260132":"Happy to take that route.","260133":"Just the ticket!","260139":"Putting the first foot out of the door was the best decision I've ever made.","260140":"With so much out there to see, one has little time for homesickness, though I do keep pictures in my locket.","260141":"Certain gentlemen might recoil seeing ladies travel alone, but that is well, if recoiled they remain.","260142":"I notice that from altitude, it appears rather like an immense toy city!","260143":"Were the world a book, most wouldn't pass the foreword. Shame, because chapter one is just about the juiciest.","260144":"How about a parambrella, for rain or shine? Goodness knows how I could use such a thing.","260148":"We have a very fixed itinerary.","260149":"That's not in the handbook!","260150":"I won't be led from the beaten path!","260151":"Purge the filth of ego inside yourself!","260152":"You are that carefree?","260153":"Want to be a hero? Try being a human first.","260154":"Get a grip on your destiny.","260155":"I know you. This isn't you.","260156":"If you seek heaven, you have far to go.","260157":"If you go down, I'll go down with you.","260158":"I'd rather be stuck at sea.","260159":"Monsoons of bad feeling!","260160":"Dreadful.","260161":"God hates us.","260162":"Miserable.","260163":"No-one deserves this.","260164":"Why are we even here?","260165":"For once you have my respect, old pal.","260166":"You've come a long way.","260167":"You bust the world open like ripe fruit.","260168":"Good fire-breather! Thaw this frozen wasteland.","260169":"Conquer your mind, conquer the world.","260170":"You do your family honour.","260171":"Milk the willing cow!","260172":"Sweet nectar.","260173":"Cascades of good feeling.","260174":"We are blessed.","260175":"No sun, but somehow all rosy.","260176":"Better than being at sea.","260177":"God loves us.","260178":"Perfection is close.","260179":"Ah old pal, it's been a while since we adventured together.","260180":"I've been waiting for your call, old pal, wherever you go I will follow.","260181":"I'm behind you, even if no-one else is.","260182":"I feel you need my capital.","260183":"I invest in upstanding people.","260184":"Any takeover would be done ethically.","260185":"Takeovers should be founded on strong principles…","260186":"Don't you cut in, you slippery fish.","260187":"This island's not about money, it's about people.","260188":"If you want to buy into my island, you buy into my ideas.","260189":"People who just take and take til there's nothing left...","260190":"Those people will never go willingly. (moral threat)","260191":"I'm grateful my claim has been settled amicably.","260192":"You've given these people prospects, I ought to thank you.","260193":"I see you trampled every forward step I made there.","260194":"You can crush everything on that island but its soul.","260195":"I admire your transparency of conduct over the island.","260196":"The acquisition was an honourable one.","260197":"Only a heathen would try to overwrite history.","260198":"The trick is to invest in the right people.","260199":"Let old Beryl take a slice.","260200":"I like to have a finger in every pie.","260201":"Well I haven't snatched it just yet!","260202":"Islands, fame, a bit of money can buy anything.","260203":"Are you sure you want to be part of me mob?","260204":"I know what you're after, and I can't let you have it.","260205":"Ah, so you want to play that game?","260206":"My island. Don't get any funny ideas.","260207":"Take it! I'll still be there in one way or toher!","260208":"Beryl wouldn't want to take it behind yer back, now.","260209":"Nice to make a legitimate acquisition.","260210":"You can pull the strings there now.","260211":"As far as you know it's all yours.","260212":"Who cares about the past, I like to live in the present.","260213":"Everything changes, it's yer one guarantee in life.","260214":"I'd have made a clean break too.","260215":"And my critics say I don't take enough risks.","260216":"I can appreciate the art of others.","260217":"My therapist says money matters dominate middle age.","260218":"I'll make sure it has a smooth finish.","260219":"Maybe losing your island will polish you off?","260220":"Don't lurk as if I am somehow past it!","260221":"What? Not even I can afford one of my pieces!","260222":"I firmly believe art should be shared by all.","260223":"You will never fully appreciate it!","260224":"You will turn majesty into a monstrosity.","260225":"Even a featureless desert can be Eden in the right hands.","260226":"This island is clay, and I am its sculptor.","260227":"An island with too many rough edges.","260228":"A chinless island. I won't work with such materials!","260229":"You cannot rewrite the history of art!","260230":"This is the desecration of all human culture!","260231":"Such vandalism weighs heavier than a thousand lives!","260232":"Perhaps a change of fortunes.","260233":"Well, I shan't be an ingrate.","260234":"A thank you is probably in order.","260235":"Oh what does it matter either way...","260236":"What else can I do but accept...","260237":"Then it shall be so...","260238":"No indeed!","260239":"I can't let it happen.","260240":"Really this is too much.","260241":"Thank the high one.","260242":"This is a blessing.","260243":"Divine succour!","260244":"Of course.","260245":"Odd, but good.","260246":"Curious. I accept.","260247":"Hush your mouth!","260248":"Why should I!?","260249":"I will not!","260250":"A good leader uses every weapon at their disposal.","260252":"As you see I've never struggled for money.","260253":"As you see, the family wealth is considerable.","260254":"How peculiar to insist we wait at port. Is something the matter?","260255":"This island needs proper leadership…","260256":"Be honest, the responsibility is too much for you.","260257":"Only empires can assimilate!","260258":"I never agreed you could be a shareholder!","260259":"Every man and his dog has money these days.","260260":"This island is crucial, you'll ruin everything!","260261":"You can't just go waltzing in!","260262":"I'm glad you gave it up without a fight.","260263":"Thanks for giving me a view of the battlefield.","260264":"An insignificant little acreage.","260265":"I only care for strategic outposts.","260266":"Pillage marks the depraved, and the doomed.","260267":"Those who go too far always regret it.","260268":"The complete debellation of my legacy.","260269":"This city is a magnet for genius.","260270":"We're in the presence of a virtuoso!","260271":"How thrilling! A renowned personage has arrived!","260272":"I shall be a trustee.","260273":"I hope I can gradually seed change.","260274":"All my life savings.","260275":"Of course, nobody wants you to lose your island...","260276":"There comes a time when we must make way for something better.","260277":"To share in reward, you must share in pain.","260278":"Meddlesome little...","260279":"Silver will not save you.","260280":"I will not rest until it is returned to me.","260281":"It will be difficult to forgive you this act of treachery!","260282":"It's good to see you are compliant.","260283":"A modest retreat to partake in my hobbies.","260284":"The secret may be out about this place.","260285":"Enjoy life there while you may.","260286":"You seize the day, and I'll wait for night.","260287":"The forest shall soon grow again,  darker and denser.","260288":"I remember what was there, don't you fret.","260289":"Even if the place is changed, the memory remains most powerful.","260290":"A surge of interest here this season.","260291":"Always hard to keep places under one's hat.","260292":"An ever-more popular site for we pilgrims.","260293":"Coming into fashion as a destination.","260294":"Where interest wanes, there will be a reason.","260295":"Numbers seem to have dropped off.","260296":"Perhaps they're going to prettier places.","260297":"That there are fewer of us should tell you something.","260298":"Visitors are falling away.","260299":"No more or less popular than before.","260300":"Our cruise was just as full as last time.","260301":"I'm glad, at least, it is not any busier.","260302":"I see the same faces whenever I come here.","260303":"Same old holiday gang as last time.","260317":"A sensation!","260318":"Everything seems up-to-the-minute!","260319":"Oh to exit these rat tubes!","260320":"I would lick spittle for you, governor.","260321":"You teach us endlessly.","260322":"In the headlines for all the right reasons.","260323":"You are more than a silent observer.","260324":"A scandal!","260325":"Black, white, and red all over!","260326":"No, drag me through the mud.","260327":"Nothing will make me leave your side.","260328":"You do keep us on our toes...","260329":"Ignore my miserable-type face.","260330":"Left to rot with last year's pumpkins!","260331":"The place is a bloomin' hole!","260332":"We've been hung out to dry!","260333":"What a dung heap.","260334":"Rather drown in slurry, than live 'ere.","260335":"This is the last straw!","260336":"I won't 'ave my babbies in squalor!","260337":"It's a filthy pigsty!","260338":"We're livin' hand-to-mouth.","260339":"It's harrowin' livin' 'ere.","260340":"We've been lured to a vile shanty-town!","260341":"I'd rather stand behind an elephant than ever return!","260342":"I will see these slums in my nightmares.","260343":"This city is a house of horrors!","260344":"A bit municipal isn't it?","260345":"It lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.","260346":"It's everything they said it would be.","260347":"I shall remember these fine edifices for some time.","260348":"I'm in love with this living watercolour!","260349":"It's peculiar here.","260350":"What do I see here? Little piles of dog lime.","260351":"This might be a once-in-a-lifetime trip.","260352":"As a centre, it is the palest shade of mediocre.","260353":"Pleasant, despite the odd pickpocket.","260354":"I think we've seen everything there is to see.","260355":"Good, but nothing to write home about.","260356":"It's nice, though the sand is too yellow.","260357":"There's a satisfying amount to enjoy.","260358":"My impression is in the main, positive.","260359":"The streets and buildings are arranged nicely.","260360":"I have no regrets about coming here.","260361":"One wonders at the genius who built all this.","260362":"What romance dwells in these streets!","260363":"It is no façade, the charms of this city are real!","260364":"So many magnificent vistas, I've lost count.","260365":"A paradise! The pleasantest conceivable bubble!","260366":"Coming here has changed my life forever.","260367":"A city of angels, streets paved with gold!","260368":"Please tell me this visit shall never be over!","260369":"Can I interest you in this recently-polished apple?","260370":"The idiot is back. Oh heavens I...I thought you were the photographer.","260371":"We feel safe!","260372":"Barely noticed there's a war on.","260373":"There's a war, apparently.","260374":"Sounds like you need a few scarecrows.","260375":"Keep them foreign rabbits off our lettuce!","260376":"The enemy's clutching at straws.","260383":"I found a sheep skull, is it a sign?","260384":"Our way o' life's under threat.","260385":"Cracks are appearing everywhere.","260395":"The first? Ooh, am I to receive a prize?","260396":"I could be the first to bring a new gem to light!","260397":"Do I have the whole place to myself!?","260398":"I beg you, no.","260399":"Surely you don't expect us to wade ashore?","260400":"Where is the welcome party?","260401":"I'm really much better at self-editing on paper...","260402":"We'll come flooding in now, I'm sure.","260403":"A gateway to imagination!","260422":"We're out of things to do but wait for the ferry.","260423":"We're bored now, so we're leaving.","260426":"You can't treat us like this!","260427":"My heart's filled with hatred!","260428":"I could smash the walls!","260429":"Hear the plea of the multitude!","260430":"A matter o' time before we explode!","260431":"Ruddy feudal system!","260432":"Petitions and signat'ries is all we need.","260433":"We're one angry voice!","260434":"I'm thinkin' of joining the chartists!","260435":"If you don't listen, things are gonna get dangerous!","260466":"If war is what it takes!","260467":"You'd hardly call it a war yet.","260468":"We're all behind you.","260469":"A civilian can voice his support.","260470":"From conflict come bold futures.","260471":"We're a united front.","260477":"An overwhelmingly positive edition!","260478":"We'll be alright.","260479":"If there's danger, tell us.","260480":"Should we be worried now?","260488":"A glowing review, absolutely no need to change it!","260489":"Ah! Good news!","260490":"We could hardly dig anything up! A-haha.","260491":"Your conscience must be spotless!","260492":"You'll want to leave this one as it is, won't you?","260493":"Too harsh?","260494":"Does it go too far?","260495":"It's as kind as we could make it.","260496":"I tried sweetening it.","260497":"We all have to swallow bitter pills sometimes.","260498":"We have done our best.","260499":"Once bright blossom now rotting stench!","260500":"I care not even for my craft.","260501":"We are a dying dream!","260502":"Bound in poison ivy!","260503":"Despair, may it all end soon.","260504":"My soul to the devil, or anyone!","260505":"If god exists, he is too cruel!","260506":"Piteous hole, a sickness of the soul.","260507":"All of my life, for nothing!","260508":"Like Persephone, I count my days in hell.","260519":"Are you sur— Of course you're sure.","260520":"Mum's the word.","260521":"I'm certain they won't read between the lines.","260522":"Call it a white lie.","260523":"The subtext is totally imperceptible.","260524":"Poetic licence.","260525":"It took minimal revision.","260526":"Something like this?","260527":"It is but a passing tempest!","260528":"Beyond the field of battle, beds of sweet lavender.","260529":"If we must have war, we shall win!","260530":"After all, papers are for drumming-up support.","260531":"You certainly have us by the leash!","260532":"It is possible to survive on scraps.","260533":"Diverting.","260534":"What glad news.","260535":"Sound the trumpets!","260536":"You are always uniquely diplomatic.","260537":"We will all be absolutely behind you.","260538":"Nobody would dare challenge your authority!","260539":"Frightening stuff!","260540":"You won't hear a peep from me.","260544":"It can only do them good, I'm sure.","260545":"Austerity, very wise.","260546":"I don't think it too severe, not at all.","260547":"Sometimes nice to have tangential news.","260548":"I don't think it's misleading.","260549":"There may be the odd unchecked fact.","260550":"Should keep them flicking through pages.","260551":"That should draw attention away from...hm.","260552":"Please, don't let them hurt me!","260553":"I am terribly, terribly afraid.","260554":"We will soon be grieving over the dead!","260555":"Candlepower ain't enough for this job.","260556":"We need 'lectricity to even start!","260557":"This place needs jolting into life!","260558":"It's important to be happy.","260559":"I think they'll swallow it.","260560":"It's a different perspective.","260564":"There's no electric!","260565":"Oi! Who turned off the lights?","260566":"We've run out of juice!","260567":"We shall not weary, but fight the eagle's grasp!","260568":"Will another glorious field be won this day?","260569":"I can already feel the swell of triumph!","260572":"Do you not see I'm incandescent?!","260573":"These conditions are an insult!","260574":"Not even the balustrades are burnished!","260575":"Just plain rude!","260576":"You will improve my situation at once!","260577":"It's tattier here than a pauper's trouser!","260578":"Of course I'm going to say what I think!","260579":"This city is an abomination!","260580":"The service is ruddy despicable!","260581":"I demand every appurtenance of my station!","260582":"The enemy has no chance of crashing our economy!","260583":"The enemy won't rock our boat, eh!","260584":"We're as safe as my nest egg.","260585":"I'm confident this island is impregnable!","260586":"Trust me, this rock is absolutely secure!","260587":"A war might even boost the markets.","260594":"For god's sake keep us safe can't you!?","260595":"The invaders will know who I am!","260596":"I will not be a prisoner in my own home!","260603":"We're quite out of energy!","260604":"We feel powerless!","260605":"There is simply no spark!","260612":"On the brink of eruption!","260613":"Who neglects their affairs in this way!","260614":"Absolute zero!","260615":"My reaction is not remotely extreme!","260616":"I am positively indignant!","260617":"Categorically unacceptable!","260618":"A failed experiment!","260619":"A place where ignorance abounds!","260620":"I am one negative particle!","260621":"Life must improve by a factor of 1000!","260622":"Perhaps war will spur scientific growth.","260623":"Conflict can sometimes be a catalyst.","260624":"War is always a litmus test.","260625":"Our chances look good on paper.","260626":"Unless the situation changes, I'll keep to my work.","260627":"Calculations show we are quite safe for the moment.","260633":"I'm sorry I'm no military engineer.","260634":"If I could only fashion a grenado…","260635":"I wish I'd studied military science.","260822":"Electricity is essential!","260823":"Did you forget to flick the switch?","260824":"Direct current now!","260838":"I am certain Alonso can be a majestic butterfly, once he emerges from his alarmingly spiny cocoon!","260839":"Mr Malching sent me a forward proposal. I myself then forwarded it to the fireplace.","260840":"I'm sure Mr Gasparov's people are as much in love with his designs as he is.","260841":"I often take tea with Beryl to see how her funny little urchins are getting along.","260842":"We all know Willie 's silly, but I won't  be the one to say he can't get his act together.","260843":"I admire how tranquil Lady Margaret is, and after all that has happened to her family.","260844":"Admiral Vicente does have a very cold sort of laugh.","260845":"It is emboldening to be among Jean La Fortune's young and aspiring people!","260846":"I still believe the Jorgensen Trust would be of interest to Her Majesty the Queen.","260847":"If ever you lack inspiration, seek Sir Archie, he is ever so happy to help!","260848":"Poor Anne Harlow. It does distress me to see how her star has fallen.","260849":"Old Nate has a lovely time up in that balloon. Perhaps he could make one for me!","260850":"I wish I were Isabel. Clever and cunning, and fighting for freedom!","260851":"I simply love Madame Kahina's shop, I hope it doesn't bother her I never buy anything.","260852":"I'm sure like so many others, Edvard could have been a good person.","260853":"Mr. Bleakworth does isolate himself, he should really try and take some fresh air.","260854":"I always adored the rambling talk of travelling ambassadors - be careful what you wish for.","260855":"My mother the Empress would have me carry out her orders instead. But I cannot, I cannot...","260862":"I'd be more modest about my eight treaties on equality, if they weren't still so goddamn necessary!","260863":"At school, they said I'd make a fine preacher. That's one thing I made sure I never did do.","260864":"The perfect society IS possible, if all spring in the same direction, like an arrow from the bowstring.","260865":"I found medicine very tedious, you need a lot of patients.","260866":"Time and struggle right wrong, but I've not much of either left to give.","260867":"Eli Bleakworth's small mind follows duty blind.","260868":"Artur and I became good friends, in spite of our contradictions.","260869":"Looking for my little regulars? Ah you won't spot 'em so easy.","260870":"Give 'em work and education, and they'll forgive yer the rest.","260871":"I pride meself on what I've built, for the urchins.","260872":"People should love yer, and if they don't, should fear yer.","260873":"What's down in the hold is my concern not yours, dear.","260874":"She may look sweet, but she'll hit below the belt if she has to.","260875":"If you want to get ahead, keep on the move.","260876":"They know not to be followed, they do.","260877":"We all have our little superstitions. I like to keep a knife in me satin boots.","260878":"Careful who you call friends. I'd rather have a bar of gold than a hundred of silver.","260879":"Keep your cards close to your chest, dearie. Check every dice thrice.","260880":"They call me a saint! Bless their little hearts, they don't know I'm a sinner!","260881":"I'll let you in on a secret, I'll always try to be nice. Life's too short.","260882":"I think we all know Willie's a numbskull. That's why we love him.","260883":"Bente is lovely; she knows absolutely nothing about the world, and the way things are.","260884":"Princess Qing enjoys forgeries like they're masterworks, and y'know, I agree with her.","260885":"God knows I'm not perfect, but Alonso might consider going to confession once in a while.","260886":"I reckon George Smith could've made a lot of money if he weren't such a stickler.","260887":"Last time Gasparov gave me a lecture, I pocketed a drawer of his silverware.","260888":"Carl is a disgusting, downright shameful creature, and I can't stop thinking about him.","260889":"You'd have to be pretty gullible to believe Lady Margaret's what she seems.","260890":"I've played chess with Silva; when he saw he was losing, he tried to upset the board.","260892":"Turning her back on the beau monde, Miss Harlow brings shame upon her family name.","260893":"Damn those pirates. Damn their greed!","260894":"Isabel Sarmento shakes the foundations of society! They should feed her to the lions!","260895":"I don't know where Kahina gets her prices!","260896":"I don't know that a bust chiselled in my image could ever really capture my true spirit!","260897":"I've been seeing Dr. Fraud for some time now. I'd recommend probing psychoanalysis to anyone.","260898":"Sacrifices must be made for us to have harmony here.","260899":"Call me old-fashioned, but I like to keep order.","260900":"Everything in its right place, and to everything its due.","260901":"I am a fossil, I won't pretend to understand modern ways.","260902":"My fleet are as unswerving as I, in their obligations.","260903":"I have ships in many harbours.","260904":"Humble trade ships, nothing more.","260905":"The face that launched a thousand ships.","260906":"I'd rather count heads than have four-poster beds.","260907":"I don't need to dress like Pope Joan to rule these reprobates.","260908":"Yeah life here's miserable, spare me the requiem.","260909":"Father'd've hated to see me live like this, but I don't care.","260910":"Yeah, I stole this ship. Start as you mean to go on!","260911":"No coward man is Annie's match at sea.","260912":"The ship it was their coffin, and their grave it was the sea","260913":"We pirates may not rule the waves, but we make them bloody choppy.","260914":"Sherwood forest, where the merry men hide out.","260915":"Our code may be strict, but it keeps our feet on the ground.","260916":"We're our own masters now, and we're building something here.","260917":"Little by little, the bird builds its nest.","260918":"Now we've a taste of freedom, we're not going to let go.","260919":"If only people listened, we'd lay down our guns.","260920":"We've had to fight to keep ourselves afloat.","260921":"I hope there comes a time we can stop fighting.","260922":"All the punishments you see are more than justified!","260923":"Too late to recover these sinners from Satan.","260924":"No way out, and no way in. Well, except through the door.","260925":"Look at them. Sickening specimens.","260926":"Don't try and rock the boat.","260927":"Meticulously drilled, and loyal to the crown.","260928":"Transportation worse than prison? Don't be so sure!","260929":"The antithesis of Noah's Ark.","260930":"I hope you aren't looking for life here.","260931":"I used to dangle from the eaves of buildings like these.","260932":"My customers appreciate the tranquillity.","260933":"After everything, I can forgive some peace and quiet.","260934":"It's wise to be ready to move on, to take change in your stride.","260935":"My routes crisscross the globe, to ensure I have the best to offer.","260936":"You don't always need to run a tight ship.","260937":"Ships don't really interest me.","260938":"This is where liberation starts.","260939":"We make do with what we have.","260940":"I hope they'll remember this as the birthplace of a revolution.","260941":"This is our new home now, we should be happy for that.","260942":"We've got to be agile, ready to move at the drop of a hat.","260943":"We can load up in a day, and be gone in a night.","260944":"It's hard to get ships. We are lucky to have friends to help us.","260945":"We never sink a ship if we can take it.","260946":"A discretionary fleet for national emergencies.","260947":"I want to be a spearhead not a figurehead.","260948":"We do not solicit violence, yet under my rule it seems as constant as the crashing waves.","260949":"I do not forget the sacrifice of these sailors on my account.","260950":"Should hold together for a time.","260951":"Soldiers had no use for the iron, all frozen such as they were.","260952":"I scratched and scraped for this.","260953":"I always dreamed of a little shack to call my own.","260954":"She used to be a wreck, but you'd never guess.","260955":"I put a lot o' graft into fixing her up.","260956":"The bow's made o' hodgepodge.","260957":"Made of sterner stuff— like boiled hooves.","260958":"Keep out! None of your business!","260959":"If your father had only let me in, we could have built this together...","260960":"This city will be a credit to our family, you'll see.","260961":"Commerce and industry can haul Goode and Sons back from the grave.","260962":"I modernised the trade fleet the moment I took control.","260963":"The sea is in my blood, just as much as it was in your father's.","260964":"I have routes all planned out, they're perfect! Perfect!","260965":"Of course I have enough experience handling sailors!","260970":"Too soon to head home?","260971":"Have we enough biscuit to last us?","260972":"We better let you decide, admiral.","260973":"What are our chances?","260974":"Do you think we can make it?","260983":"I've recently discovered hypnosis— works wonders on the sleepless.","260984":"Natural history helps us understand why the crocodile mother defends its brood, or the scorpion keeps a sting in its tail.","260985":"I prefer coffee of late. One learns to embrace the bitterness.","260986":"I retired from the spotlight when I remarried. But being part of the royal council is a pleasing distraction.","260987":"Though I've been a Hunt  for a long time, it's as my dead brother used to say; once a Harlow, always a Harlow.","260988":"I would not leave this life, until I felt I'd achieved a sense of peace.","260989":"If people want something to get behind, we have to encourage them!","260990":"Wibblesock is a small boy, with the temerity to believe life is some schoolyard game.","260992":"I have had the misfortune to take tea with Beryl, her piggled cakes and sugary tea.","260993":"Artur's own reflection will swallow him up soon enough.","260994":"Her Majesty honours me with a position on the council, but I prefer to stay out of the light.","260995":"Testing times for the monarchy, but I'm sure balance will be restored soon.","260996":"Silva is from a rival empire. You should think about eliminating him.","260997":"Poor Anne. She is my niece you know—our ways are so different I often forget.","260998":"The unpredictable, like Graves, develop no power to predict.","260999":"George Smith wants a better world? Well.. don't we all!","261000":"Von Malching keeps things to himself, I like that.","261001":"Proud to be exactly what my father wasn't - a traitor! God save the Queen!","261002":"A thousand privateers who would die to live, and me, who lives only to die.","261003":"We are wronged, all of us. The Empire shall feel the wrath of scimitar, spear and cutlass!","261004":"My whole house gone to hell, but for I, the last swish of its flaming tail.","261005":"If execution was good enough for my brother, it'll be good enough for Her Majesty.","261006":"Any pirate not flying my flag is a dead man - you hear me La Fortune?!","261007":"Even I don't completely hate Bente.","261008":"Aunt Maggie doesn't approve of barefaced vengeance.","261009":"I'll jam the crown down over her ears, for my father 'Ben Harlow!'","261010":"I'll rip off Blake's toupee, and make him eat it like a dog.","261011":"Graves has it right, only death can wash away the pain!","261012":"If Aunt Maggie won't fight tooth and nail for our blood, then I'll have to go it alone.","261014":"Independence works two ways - rely on no-one, and no-one relies on you.","261015":"I have a young family whose hopes rest on a roll of the dice. But at least we have dice to roll.","261016":"Who will benefit from our defiance? All that are human.","261017":"I'm pretty good at talking my way out,  but I rarely get that luxury.","261018":"If we're such small fish, why can't they just let us swim?","261020":"I'm sure the Empire's just as bad as La Corona. Of course, I wouldn't tell Her Majesty that!","261021":"We may seem dissimilar, but Beryl and I are a lot alike.","261022":"George should consider practising what he preaches.","261023":"Archibald's 'constitution' is unconstitutional, just like every government ever.","261024":"Anne's got no code. She'll fight anyone and everyone.","261025":"I wouldn't wager a newt on Wibblesock, if he were the last egg in the pond.","261026":"At least Bente came here and heard us out, but I wouldn't want her to have to help us.","261027":"Eli Bleakworth's kind don't see beyond lines, it's all always black or white.","261028":"If Alonso cooperated, we'd have this place for ourselves. But he's crazy, insane!","261029":"Lady Margaret? I'd be surprised if she didn't have her moments of madness.","261030":"Gasparov's French is impressive, from the outside at least.","261031":"This rock's for the worst of the worst, you'll not find a goodly soul upon it!","261032":"All Her Majesty asks of me, is that I keep the peace.","261033":"I've got better things to do than bleat with you over H.M.'s rotten biscuits and insipid tea.","261034":"The chimpanzees can swing about as much as they like inside— good practice for the gallows.","261035":"Give 'em an inch, they take a mile. They even have their own cells now!","261036":"Do I condemn you now, or merely give you a length of rope with which to strangle yourself?","261037":"Malching must know that crime never pays.","261038":"If I could break one of Beryl's urchins, we'd have her head in the gibbet.","261039":"I don't think Sir Archibald has the stomach for my work.","261040":"I saw Benjamin Harlow drop, and will see his pirate niece Anne hang just the same!","261041":"Anne Harlow proves even the nobility can be corrupted by the Devil.","261042":"Jean LaFortune should stop gambling on his life, and hand himself in.","261043":"Is it only Madame Kahina's prices that are criminal, or is there some truth to these rumours about her past?","261044":"Sarmento is a myth, or we'd have had her in for interrogation long ago.","261045":"Admiral Silva serves a different Empire, and is therefore not in my jurisdiction.","261046":"Graves will be caught, and when he is he will pay the maximum possible penalty.","261047":"This is a new life for me, I still have luxury, without any of the danger.","261048":"I don't know if the Queen knows what a burden power over life and death becomes.","261049":"People see what they want to see. As the years pass, I've learned to play on those assumptions.","261050":"It's better to hold on to your secrets, I can tell you that for free.","261051":"I'm expecting a javelin through the back at any moment.","261052":"Can bad actions have good reasons? I try not to think about it anymore.","261053":"Archie's mind is a lot sharper than he lets on.","261054":"Isabel and her people want change, only fools aren't open to that.","261055":"For Isabel, I'd moonlight again, if only to remember how it feels.","261056":"Maybe Old Nathaniel doesn't know, but the spirit of the dead lives on in their possessions.","261057":"Eli thinks everyone has to suffer for justice to be done.","261058":"Vicente is paranoid I study the book of Judith.","261059":"I'll join them again in the fields... my brothers and sisters, once we have set this land free.","261060":"Jean is reckless like my brother was. I don't blame him. He is only trying to survive, to protect the ones he loves.","261061":"I was young when I joined the movement, I never imagined I would one day be giving the orders.","261062":"This is not about revenge, but securing our people a future free of La Corona. We have to stick together.","261063":"My brother fought back violently against La Corona. He was murdered. We have to try another way.","261064":"If we strike against La Corona, we have to make it count!","261065":"Let Admiral Silva cling to his dying dream, we hear the little birds of freedom sing!","261066":"La Corona may be our enemy, not the Queen, but to trust empire for us is impossible.","261067":"If Anne Harlow could forget the past, we could build a better future together.","261068":"Alonso is a powder keg. He threatens to destroy the delicate balance we've worked so hard for.","261069":"Madame Kahina is the best. Quick, clean, and never draws attention. How does she do it?","261070":"George dances well for an invalid, we all need to cut free sometimes.","261072":"I took this command because it has always been my destiny. Under my leadership, La Corona shall once more be victorious.","261073":"Apparently my father disliked babies. I think I shall be as decisive, but slightly less mad.","261074":"Lady Margaret Hunt, née Harlow, is a respected voice on the Royal Council.","261075":"It doesn't matter what you think of me, it is what I think of you.","261076":"Archie has been like a father to me, his company fills me with all those paternal hopes and comforts.","261077":"Archie never stops me eating jam, and will suffer the subsequent indigestion for me too!","261078":"If not for Archie, the rest would still be leading me up and down stairs like an infant.","261079":"Sarmento is a strong woman, let us hope she keeps no secrets from us.","261080":"Anne Harlow must know that no injustice can excuse her own crimes.","261081":"Jean La Fortune is a pirate whose name I too-commonly hear.","261082":"The council has agreed my prison reforms, so I hope Mr. Bleakworth will bend a little.","261083":"Miss Jorgensen is a distant relative. Although all my relatives are quite distant.","261084":"I understand we have visiting royalty in Princess Qing. She's a gentle soul.","261085":"Willie Wibblesock? A made-up name surely?!","261086":"It's Mr von Malching. I will never offer that awful man a barony.","261088":"The presence of Vicente Silva is clearly an attempt by La Corona to challenge my authority here.","261089":"Semaphore stations'll soon be disused - there's a tip for old iron.","261090":"Isabel's people are resistors, fighting for their Ohms.","261091":"Found an egg with a palace in it. Fixed the hinge and stuck it on the bow of my lady blimp.","261092":"Zeppelins'll take off, you'll see. Soon they'll all want a piece of my lady blimp.","261093":"Turn a greasy hat inside out, and it looks to 'ave been oiled purposely!","261094":"Coffins make nice boats. But make sure the lid doesn't shut on you.","261095":"I could use George Smith's bath chair, once he's gone. Can't be long now can it?","261096":"Archibald Blake commissioned the Queen a balloon, then he realised it was all a lot of hot air.","261097":"The Queen may have snatched every last bit of land and sea, but I have the skies to meself.","261098":"Alonso's good to follow at a distance; for all the leftovers.","261099":"That windsock Willie still complaining? The lad doesn't know his luck.","261100":"Don't dabble with Kahina, she's a lethal businesswoman.","261101":"I offered Bente a place on my balloon, but she guffawed and called it cheating!","261102":"I shouldn't have to play second fiddle to anyone.","261103":"I ride my Phaeton more and more often to the palace, I'm in great demand with Queen and council you see.","261104":"Goode & Sons has a future among the constellations, not in petty ship trades!","261105":"I was born for this age. With my Olympian ideas, my industry, my sacrifice, all is possible!","261106":"Why should his passion and ambition count against a man?","261107":"The responsibility could weigh heavy, but I am more than equal, much more.","261108":"Naturally I deal with Sir Archibald; it's his duty to greet Her Majesty's proudest subjects.","261109":"Isabel Sarmento? Never heard of her.","261110":"I'm watching you. Any suspicious behaviour will be reported immediately to Eli.","261111":"Samuel was always so suspicious of Lady Hunt, but she has a seat on the royal council for goodness' sake!","261112":"If only I had the invitingly empty sort of paper for writing, not lined, for accounting.","261113":"Fictions only remind me how little of my own writing I've done lately.","261114":"If ever I seem far away, remember so were you, those long years.","261115":"One should get to know one's kin, shouldn't one?","261116":"Getting things done bright and early maintains discipline for the remaining day.","261117":"After a jam scone at teatime, I feel a different person. That is to say, a sympathetic one.","261118":"I can't see how any woman finds calisthenics remotely emancipating.","261119":"I have to make do with living vicariously through your exploits.","261120":"The land of many rivers shall see me again, when all is forgiven.","261121":"Old pal, don't you find it strange they keep the recipe for sausage so secret?!","261122":"If the body is the field in which the mind works, would you farm on barren soil?","261123":"Do not incite violence. Prepare for it.","261124":"The music here is fine, but it lacks the colour of a raga.","261125":"I vowed to defend you, it requires no explanation.","261126":"Compared to what brought us together, this is nothing, old pal.","261127":"We met in war; we will find ourselves there again. We must be prepared for that moment.","261128":"Perhaps this island is as yet unclaimed?","261129":"Does this land belong to your Queen, or may I...?","261130":"I wish to found a new kingdom here.","261131":"Could this be my lucky island!?","261132":"If you don't want it, you should share it.","261133":"This one doesn't look too scary, d'you mind?","261136":"When loved ones pass away, it helps to keep yourself occupied with joyful things!","261137":"I knew the moment we met, the jolly royal council would come around to you!","261138":"I for one hope you uncover proof of your father's innocence!","261140":"If you need counsel during the trial, my door is always open.","261141":"There's been a dreadful misunderstanding, it's now I need your support most.","261142":"Perhaps you can convince them; all I want is peace!","261144":"I see. You have come home to great responsibility, and I have left home with it.","261145":"I am also keen to work with the Queen. Perhaps one day you will help arrange a meeting?","261146":"Isabel's rebellion I think, is the first I understand. But the Pyrphorian danger is greatly to be feared.","261147":"I am very curious to see your legal process in action!","261148":"Sorry your father's dead. I remember when I lost me old mum; always think of her when things are going wrong.","261149":"Like you, I'd do anything for the Queen. Reminds me of me mum. Younger et cetera, but you know, intimidating.","261150":"I hear stories about those Pyrphorians that have me tossing and turning til daybreak.","261151":"Cor, that Edvard eh? Deserves a really nasty end!","261152":"Don't let them judge you by your father's actions; you're your own person.","261153":"I hear you're building warships—arms dealer to the Empire…","261154":"Isabel remains fundamentally good. You can trust her to seek out truth.","261155":"No greater punishment exists for your Uncle Edvard than a fair trial.","261156":"Watch out. There'll be trouble on the way if you start stirring in the pond.","261157":"So you think you're high society now you're in with the Queen?","261158":"Oh, now you've stirred up the old hornet’s nest.","261159":"I always try to avoid the courtroom whenever I can.","261160":"Your family is infamous, but it's not all about you and your father, you know.","261161":"A pity, isn't it? Vulgar warships are scarcely the sort of royal commission I'd want.","261162":"The colonies are a distraction for the distracted.","261163":"Glad my bespoke silverware is finally safe.","261164":"Father failed you too, did he? You'll want to restore your family's soiled name.","261165":"Edvard's right, where is our royal fleet commission?","261166":"Of course, only a fool would have let Prosperity slip in the first place. The clue is in the name!","261167":"Family only ever hold us back.","261168":"So, your father was a traitor, eh? Sounds like my sort of fellow!","261169":"Why lose your head over a family scandal, when you could be losing it in so much more interesting ways?!","261170":"Welcome to the jungle!","261171":"Wow, your family is really messed up!","261172":"You're lucky your family's treachery is not pertinent to La Corona.","261173":"If the Empire is building a fleet, I better start building one too…","261174":"Sarmento is a sworn enemy of La Corona. One day we will deal with her rabble once and for all.","261175":"If real justice were done, Prosperity would still belong to La Corona, like back in the old days!","261176":"A terrible shame, what happened to your father, dear child.","261177":"You could be the star all of us have so long waited for.","261178":"Chasing after the past won't make you happy, my dear. Let it go—ring in the future!","261179":"I imagine the Queen naively thinks the trial might restore some of her authority.","261180":"My father gave his life to his king. Your father gave his life to his Queen. Still they're never sated.","261181":"You'd fight the crown if you knew the truth, not crawl beneath it.","261182":"Say hello to my old mate Jean, won't yer?","261183":"My father never had the privilege of a trial. Your Queen's father near strung him up himself.","261186":"Believe me, I share Isabel's cause, but I already have enough trouble with the Empire.","261188":"We can't deny it's a difficult time. The sale of Prosperity was highly destabilising for Her Majesty.","261192":"I've no doubt corruption runs in the family, and I'll be watching you closely.","261193":"Don't drag me into your conspiracy theories. Everybody knows your father was a crook.","261194":"If you weed out a single Pyrphorian you are to bring them to me first for questioning! Is that understood?","261196":"I may have known your father as a good man, but I don't know you at all.","261198":"Be careful out there. The rainforest is full of surprises.","261199":"Justice, revenge—the truth is never black and white.","261200":"If you do not fulfil our alliance, I fear it will be a humiliation.","261201":"Please aid me as you promised, and dispel this nightmare!","261202":"Were you expecting celebrations and a fatted calf on your return?","261206":"I'm in a war with your mate, but I think I know where your loyalties lie.","261208":"I'm at war with your ally. I appreciate this may be a difficult choice.","261209":"This isn't the nice sort of surprise is it?","261210":"I admit, a mafia is not very Jorgensen.","261212":"You and I share lifelong passions for discovery!","261214":"Your researches make me jump.","261231":"Started a little war with your friend, hope that won't turn the milk sour between us?","261320":"I declared war on your friend; guarantee they will be your friend no longer!","261321":"I clash with your vile acquaintance; will you follow in fashion?","261322":"I am about to hurt your friend. Wanna join in?","261323":"I have declared war on your ally, so you'd better choose carefully.","261352":"I have no choice but to punish your friend, but that is no reason for us to quarrel.","261356":"You're not involved in the mafia, are you?","261357":"It seems I had unexpected visitors!","261358":"Maybe I shouldn't go away so often…","261359":"I'm sure you knew nothing about these creeps.","261360":"It must have been the trustees.","261361":"But surely you don't think I would ever…?","261362":"Say you haven't lost trust in the Trust?","261363":"Oh why are my trustees such awful people!","261364":"You are dreaming up a brighter future!","261365":"Hurrah for science!","261366":"Your finger is very firmly on the pulse.","261367":"Isn't it all a bit sudden?","261368":"You skirt behind the curtain, knife in hand.","261369":"Shadows lift the window latch.","261370":"I found an alien bee among my flowers.","261371":"A strange fish was swimming with the shoal.","261372":"Mountains know which are the pure-hearted snowflakes.","261373":"It is my mother who pulls these strings.","261374":"I wished only to observe.","261375":"We are merely curious.","261376":"It is my mother the Empress, who embraces deception.","261377":"I feared the Empress would be displeased, if I did not send them.","261378":"I find your inventiveness fascinating.","261379":"I believe your future will blossom.","261380":"These strange concepts are inspiring.","261381":"You do not innovate, but imitate.","261382":"Technology is a form of greed.","261383":"Do not seek to improve nature.","261384":"Going behind me back, that is so naughty, that is!","261385":"I found 'em, you're in big trouble, you is!","261386":"Et tu Brute? Stab your old mate Wibbly?","261387":"Don't you start haunting me with your phantoms!","261388":"So…you're part of the mafia as well?","261389":"I am master of shadows! What do you mean you found 'em?","261390":"I honestly have no idea who they were.","261391":"Honour bright, I'll never do it again.","261392":"Means we're both as cunning as each other then, eh!","261393":"Don't reach up my sleeves, that is the first rule!","261394":"Cor science and all that? You're a braver one than I.","261395":"Nice science! Bit complicated though, innit?","261396":"Ooh, researching new tricks?","261397":"An apple fell on my head too, and it bloody hurt!","261398":"Science cheapens magic!","261399":"A magician NEVER reveals his secrets.","261400":"Your moles have always been blind.","261401":"What are all these flies on my walls?!","261402":"They may as well have had 'spy' written on their foreheads!","261403":"I prefer to have things out in the open.","261404":"I knew I didn't trust you.","261405":"You can't hide the truth forever.","261406":"Sharing ideas, nothing more.","261407":"I meant no disrespect.","261408":"You can't blame me for disbelieving.","261409":"I should know, trust works both ways.","261410":"Ah, a scholar of the sciences?","261411":"You look toward the future, as I do.","261412":"Innovation can realise our dream.","261413":"No one likes a know-it-all.","261414":"You have science, but no spirit.","261415":"Science and war often ride out together.","261416":"Now what do we have here?","261417":"I have eyes everywhere, dearie.","261418":"I know my urchins by face, and that's not one of them.","261419":"Curiosity killed the cat.","261420":"Yer a slippery snake in the pond y'are.","261421":"For every scamp you catch, there'll be three you've missed.","261422":"He can't be a spy; he's just a little boy.","261423":"One of mine? No, that can't be!","261424":"Me run a mafia? You must be mad.","261425":"Ah well, worth a sneaky try!","261426":"If yer can keep it to yerself, wonderful.","261427":"Don't let anybody sabotage yer genius.","261428":"Me regulars speak only of your advancement.","261429":"Yer think you can keep all those ideas to yerself?!","261430":"Why couldn't you give old Beryl the lowdown?","261431":"I hope you are going to share all yer fine ideas?","261432":"Seems I have a secret admirer!","261433":"I know every possible alcove.","261434":"A poor use of shadow.","261435":"I accept no imitations.","261436":"I've seen through your masquerade.","261437":"I have to keep up with trends somehow.","261438":"Virtuosos need their muses.","261439":"It's important to explore different spaces.","261440":"Great art takes inspiration where it can.","261441":"One has to stay in touch.","261442":"Science really is the art nouveau!","261443":"New techniques can freshen things up, certainly.","261444":"A scientific verticality!","261445":"I have no time for modernism.","261446":"Progress at the expense of beauty.","261447":"Buried in the future, you lose the zeitgeist.","261448":"Dabbling in disorganised crime?!","261449":"Who do you think you are, the scarlet pimple-nel?","261450":"Industrial sabotage!","261451":"Bamboozle me?!","261452":"Your blind mice have lost their tails!","261453":"How the devil did you find out!?","261454":"That is business these days.","261455":"Can't you see, everyone has spies!","261456":"Take my deception as a compliment!","261457":"No! No!! The fool was caught!","261458":"Your scientific dabbling is paying off.","261459":"Your science fixation doesn't look so freakish now!","261460":"Your ghoulish experimentations bear sublime fruit.","261461":"I should have the most fecund laboratories!","261462":"Why aren't my squares that brilliant?!","261463":"I want to profit from the scientific sphere!","261464":"Skulk in shade, guillotine blade.","261465":"Hide like a coward!","261466":"I have a sneaking suspicion…","261467":"Your emissaries curl like salted slugs.","261468":"I have blunted your dagger of espion.","261469":"Tentacles grow back.","261470":"I must be omnipresent.","261471":"They are my feelers, my antennae.","261472":"They foreshadow the coming frenzy.","261473":"Thank you for returning my cloak and dagger.","261474":"Science gives you new tools. I like new tools.","261475":"Your progress really gave me a jolt.","261476":"I also like to experiment.","261477":"I could make you my guinea pig?","261478":"Yet you fail to answer the fundamental questions.","261479":"I prefer practise to theory.","261480":"What are you hiding from?","261481":"Afraid to fight in the open?","261482":"Only cowards skulk in the shadows.","261483":"It's laughable you thought I wouldn't notice.","261484":"I've uncovered your little plot.","261485":"One of my scouts losing their way, that's all.","261486":"It was merely counter-espionage.","261487":"An inexcusable failure of my intelligence service.","261488":"Another slapdash infiltration.","261489":"It's your fault I'm suspicious in the first place.","261490":"Science can improve the economy and our quality of life.","261491":"I admire a good breakthrough.","261492":"Innovation is absolutely essential.","261493":"Your advances can't disguise your shoddy leadership.","261494":"I wait for the right moment before I advance.","261495":"Stop trying to get ahead!","261496":"So, you take pleasure in a masquerade?","261497":"There's no need for secrecy, I've nothing to hide.","261498":"So unnecessary, when all is out in the open.","261499":"Oh, then you don't trust me?","261500":"Come child, no need to hide your true feelings.","261501":"They are many and everywhere.","261502":"How silly to think I would hide something from you.","261503":"You see, we are all drawn to your remarkable aura.","261504":"I'm glad you found them, it shows you are on your guard.","261505":"How clever of you to have discovered them.","261506":"Most prudent to look to the future.","261507":"You young things with your wild ideas.","261508":"Your advances show a wisdom beyond your years.","261509":"Experiments will often go frightfully wrong.","261510":"You meddle in what you don't understand.","261511":"Stay clear of the laboratory if you want to avoid a nasty accident.","261512":"I'll smash something of yours soon enough.","261513":"I'm fighting your ally, save time and say I can drown you both.","261514":"I'd rather fight without you, but we had an agreement.","261515":"Just 'cos I fight for you, doesn't make us friends.","261516":"Come here at your peril.","261517":"I told you to stay away, or do you need you ears opening?","261518":"Not even death can make us happy.","261519":"Their blood'll beat while your heart still does.","261520":"Come on, that's an inanimate object!","261521":"Will you protect me and my family as you said you would?","261522":"It is a big risk for us, but oui, we will fight for you.","261523":"They pray morning and evening this war will end.","261524":"We desire only to defend these properties and the families that inhabit them.","261525":"War is bad for you, we have allies everywhere.","261526":"They'll lay down arms the moment you make a fair peace offer.","261527":"We are at war with your ally, let us see your true colours.","261529":"Unite! Unite!","261530":"I'm not feeling so good...","261533":"Take the streets!","261534":"Lord, please, save us!","261535":"Is this how it's going to end for me...?","261536":"The flames! It's out of control!","261537":"We will not take this oppression!","261538":"Was it something I ate...?","261539":"I'm so sick of this administration!","261540":"Grab what you can and run!","261542":"Mother, my tummy hurts…","261551":"Did anyone let out the pigs...?","261552":"Come on, the sun is up!","261553":"Do we have enough for breakfast?","261554":"No! This is the third pot broken this week...","261555":"I apologize if it's a bit dull...","261556":"The gears are completely rusted!","261557":"All these technological advancements!","261558":"Keep the change, you look like you need it.","261559":"Careful with that!","261561":"Lunch in five!","261562":"Do you smell that...?","261563":"You think it'll rain tomorrow?","261564":"Well...","261565":"Such a long trip... for this.","261566":"I swear, if I see another biscuit...!","261567":"Such a powerful beast!","261568":"I'd like it better with chips...","261569":"How is this even possible!?","261570":"Not even the best restorer could help that mess.","261571":"It's going to be an arms race...","261572":"Give'em hell!","261573":"Ring the bells!","261574":"We're rotting'ere...","261575":"I agree that it is a delicate situation...","261576":"Family's our only nation.","261577":"Ya hear what happened to the Goodes...?","261578":"Is it just the wind that howls at night...?","261579":"All day ploughing this bloody rock...!","261580":"You should've seen her face!","261581":"Aw! My toes!","261582":"Look how much paper you've wasted!","261583":"Father, will you teach me how to paint?","261584":"Mother, how did you become an engineer?","261586":"Of course I can lend you some, old pal!","261587":"Aye, it's working!","261588":"Really? That many carats?","261589":"In all my years...!","261590":"We need another man at the cart!","261591":"I will treasure these memories...","261592":"It's... something.","261593":"Are... those mountains... moving...?","261594":"Are we done?","261595":"Is this supposed to surprise me...?","261596":"Will it impact our lives...?","261597":"Are we going to be ok...?","261598":"Get to cover, quick!","261599":"I'm starving...","261600":"I am quite worried about our relationships with the South.","261601":"Mon frère! Come have a drink!","261602":"To think that Samuel...","261603":"My lumbago's never been worse.","261604":"You're tying the knot? Congratulations!","261605":"Any news? Of course not...","261606":"I'll talk to her this Sunday.","261607":"Have you noticed his manners?","261608":"This administration is fundamentally flawed...","261609":"She even has time to loaf around!","261610":"He didn't even tip his hat...!","261611":"Pass the hammer!","261612":"Start the machines!","261613":"Step back, kid.","261614":"Help me carry these back.","261615":"Not completely what I expected...","261616":"There's nothing!

Help!","264286":"Put it out, put it out!","264287":"My spirit is weak.","264288":"We are very sick!","264289":"We look to a cure!","264290":"Long live the revolution!","264291":"We will not let our rights be stomped!","264292":"We stand up to abuse!","264302":"This is the path of passive resistance!","264303":"We've organised a picket!","264304":"No activity from us activists!","264305":"We are not your minions!","264306":"Expect nothing any time soon.","264307":"Go back to your families.","264308":"Stop production!","264309":"No more work for now!","264310":"Back to the future!","264311":"I can start singing again!","264312":"Return to your posts!","264344":"Wise to take time to learn the nuances!","264345":"I can teach you how it works?","264346":"Of course, come join us!","264347":"The more the merrier!","264348":"What brings you here, governor?","264349":"Trying to make the best of the situation...","264350":"Quality isn't quantity.","264351":"I believed we would be independent.","264352":"I miss my family…","264353":"I am losing my enthusiasm.","264359":"Ideal conditions!","264360":"Time to develop my passions!","264361":"A modern-thinking governor!","264362":"I can't wait to start work every morning!","264363":"I am so motivated!","264367":"Our hopes are turning to ash!","264368":"Everything we worked for, up in smoke!","264369":"A great sickness is spreading!","264370":"The fruit of labour is tainted!","264371":"We are keen to get started again.","264372":"We cannot catch the future standing still.","264376":"The fertility is missing.","264377":"We can't get that here.","264378":"We lack the means of production!","264379":"What about workshops?","264380":"We need more workers!","264381":"Gather more people!","264382":"We need raw materials!","264383":"There must be input for output!","264384":"These must be stored somewhere.","264385":"If there's no place we can take it to…","264386":"We're up to our eyebrows!","264387":"We are out of room!","264390":"We are ordinary workers, but in it together.","264391":"Change begins here. Let's roll up our sleeves and make a difference.","264392":"I hope you fight for our rights.","264393":"I don't usually approve of violence, but…","264394":"Sometimes we need to take action.","264395":"We should try to win hastily!","264396":"Our enemies are the tyrants!","264397":"We shall prevail for greater good!","264403":"Could they break our spirit…?","264404":"They have no scruples!","264405":"Our future is threatened!","264408":"We require electrical power!","264409":"The dream depends on electricity!","264410":"We need to feel connected!","264419":"Hallelujah.","264420":"The dream is kept alive!","264421":"Praise be for the certainties we have!","264426":"I am eternally grateful for your support.","264427":"You have proven all is still possible.","264428":"You endure where others have not.","264433":"We cannot allow this to stop us believing.","264434":"We have let a chance pass us by.","264435":"Now I feel the wind begin to bite.","264440":"Please, don't follow the Arctic Council's example.","264441":"Perhaps you don't realise the scale of this undertaking.","264442":"You don't seem as committed as the others.","264447":"I, Lady Faithful, knock at every door to rouse the bold and the daring.","264448":"You may know of my husband, Sir John Faithful whose Arctic expedition is lost and forsaken?","264449":"Be assured, your efforts will be suitably rewarded.","264450":"We must stick together if we are to endure the chill.","264451":"It cannot be long now before we find something.","264456":"The absence of a base camp might explain why the Arctic council never sustained their rescue efforts.","264457":"This encampment must embody hope, our one comfort in the wilderness.","264460":"Until the fate of any lost ship is affirmed, our efforts should not diminish.","264461":"Many ships from many sponsors, united by a profound desire to bring back those men alive.","264464":"Just when I was beginning to lose faith.","264465":"If we pull together like this, who knows what we can achieve.","264466":"We must thank the Inuit spirits who dwell here.","264467":"We can do it.","264468":"Yes, I fear we must.","264469":"Yes, we must set our preconceptions aside.","264470":"It would only make me worry.","264471":"Something urges me not to.","264472":"It's impossible.","264496":"I'm very grateful.","264497":"You are doing marvellous work.","264498":"Your generosity won't be forgotten.","264542":"We must rally together now, if we are to find them.","264543":"I value any help I can get, from any direction.","264544":"You will be rewarded, I promise.","264547":"Good, we all are with you.","264548":"Thank you.","264550":"They said it was impossible, you proved them wrong!","264551":"You have survived the elements!","264555":"Was the reward not substantial enough?","264556":"What could have led you astray?","264557":"Seems we've not learned from the mistakes of the past.","264558":"The cold has got to us.","264560":"The Arctic summer is only a brief window.","264561":"We don't have much time.","264563":"It does not end there, we must keep going.","264564":"This must be a sustained effort.","264565":"I know it feels like going from one pole to another.","264569":"Have you something?","264570":"Something to give us hope?","264572":"I await news of our next compass heading.","264573":"The matter is out of our hands for the time being.","264578":"The most ambitious rescue I've had the honour to be part of.","264579":"I hoped and feared I might one day have the privilege of such an undertaking.","264580":"Can we do worse than the Arctic council? They're afraid of the ice in their whisky!","264581":"I will not rest while fellow seamen succumb to the cold, we are with you!","264582":"The Northwest passage is uncharted, Admiral. More than preparation, we need luck.","264583":"I don't want to join the many that tried and failed to find them.","264584":"It's a cairn o'rocks stacked by human hand! We have stumbled upon Sir John Faithful's last encampment!","264585":"We've found no trace of Sir John and his crew, let us hope there is time to try again.","264586":"We must be better prepared if we are to follow in the fateful footsteps of Sir John.","264587":"I knew another captain who ventured this far north, but I know him no more.","264588":"We all know this could be our last expedition, so may it be a fine one!","264589":"If we die in the attempt, it won't be for a lack of commitment.","264590":"It'll be the stuff of folklore if we succeed and bring back Sir John.","264591":"Bears, vicious whales and restless spirits await us, if the tales are to be believed.","264592":"It's a lot to ask, but to a seaman there's no challenge to rival the Arctic.","264593":"A wise seaman would trust the Inuits. They know their land better than we ever will.","264594":"I myself have little experience of the Arctic, but stand beside you.","264595":"Seaman's intuition tells me they came this way, but I've been wrong before.","264596":"I fear we may be as lost as the original expedition.","264597":"Let's hope we warm mother nature's frozen heart soon.","264598":"The chill already gnaws at the bones of our crew.","264599":"If I know Sir John Faithful right, I'd say he came this way.","264600":"You made a seal hole, now catch a seal!","264601":"If these men seem impervious to cold, it's Lady Faithful's fire we have to thank.","264602":"I've met few so hardy as Lady Faithful, we can't let her down now.","264603":"And I thought the Arctic Council's efforts were pathetic.","264604":"We might have turned back long ago, had the mysteries of the ice not drawn us in.","264605":"Even I have rarely seen such extremes, and worse may be yet to come.","264606":"We cannot be too thorough in our preparations, yet we must also be swift.","264607":"We must make waves, channel my John's spirit of adventure.","264608":"Because we have failed now, does not mean I shall give up hope.","264609":"We didn't even get close, and yet I sense they are there, all of them.","264610":"We will not make the same mistakes other rescuers did.","264611":"We have the chance to save what otherwise might be lost to the ice forever.","264612":"This is a matter in which I have a deep personal interest.","264614":"Among the many others, my dearest Sir John, is lost to the ice.","264615":"Signs they were there? The search may begin in earnest!","264616":"The Faithful Expedition shall be the success that no other ever was.","264617":"We must be ready for all eventualities, this shall be no small endeavour.","264618":"The Inuit will know something, I intend to seek their insight at the earliest opportunity.","264619":"We should approach these preparations with clarity of purpose.","264620":"I dream of seeing us cut through the ice like a hot knife through butter!","264621":"I will not rest until the lost expedition are fed, bathed in hot salts and tucked up in their beds.","264622":"I can neglect not one supply that may prove useful in an icy wasteland.","264623":"We cannot underinvest in provisions and equipment.","264624":"We cannot rely on Inuit knowledge alone, we must have our own expertise.","264625":"We need the best minds to have any dream of succeeding.","264626":"The least I can save is my husband's reputation, if indeed he has found a northwest passage.","264627":"Glorious it is when wandering time comes.","264628":"If you walk on thin ice, you may as well dance.","264629":"Be the lead dog, and show where to go.","264630":"Find this seal hole.","264631":"Watch out for bears.","264632":"To ignore the wisdom of the Inuit is an arrogance we cannot afford.","264633":"The Arctic Council disregarded Inuit expertise and it got them nowhere!","264634":"The strong qimmiq pulls through.","264635":"You have a good nose.","264636":"It is easy to underestimate this place.","264637":"This is a harsh land.","264638":"We should do what we can to survive.","264639":"I am relieved not all misunderstand the Inuit as you do.","264640":"We should take gifts when they are offered.","264641":"We waste no chance we have here.","264642":"Now is your time.","264643":"That was only the beginning.","264644":"The day is young, there is more to do.","264645":"Do you share with the hunting party?","264646":"Should I heat some tea?","264647":"There is nothing more to be said.","264648":"It is a time of silence.","264649":"Temperatures will not favour us for long.","264650":"The Faithful Expedition is in dire need of that Icebreaker.","264651":"The Arctic Council thought breaking the ice impossible too, yet someone has clearly managed it!","264652":"It shows we have conquered our fear.","264653":"Seems the balance is restored.","264654":"These are good signs.","264655":"Let us show the Arctic Council we do not give up on anyone.","264656":"They underestimated the power of nature, but I cannot watch them be punished for it.","264657":"We cannot all hope to best the elements, as the council themselves are always keen to point out.","264658":"There is much to be afraid of now.","264659":"You have done well, and you smell nice.","264660":"You have damaged the balance of things.","264661":"When the ice breaks, I want you there with me.","264662":"The wolf has kept you strong, caribou.","264663":"I must consult the spirit now.","264664":"It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.","264665":"You are meddling in witchcraft.","264666":"You have let many people down.","264667":"A shaman must help those in need. We will share what we know.","264668":"We were afraid you would come for them. Now you are here we must help you.","264669":"To know where you are going, you have to know where you come from.","264670":"An annuraaq should be watertight.","264671":"A fur hood would help shake the snow from your face.","264672":"We do not camp anywhere long, the season changes fast.","264673":"The igluit are made with anything we can find.","264674":"During the long dark winter, we will play games and tell stories.","264675":"Seal is important to us, we are careful to waste no part of it.","264676":"Take only the whale and bear that you need.","264678":"We still have much to learn from the Inuit, if we are to succeed the next time.","264679":"I thought together we could do it, I hope one day I can still be proven right.","264680":"May we repay this kindness.","264681":"We are thankful.","264682":"Nakurmiik; thank you.","264683":"Yes.","264684":"Ee.","264685":"Good.","264686":"Not good.","264687":"I am sorry.","264688":"Nakka.","264689":"May you have warmth in your iglu.","264690":"May you have oil in your lamp.","264691":"Go with peace in your heart.","264692":"Coming here, I realise the frightening scale of what lies ahead of us.","264693":"The ice is as old as time, and more stubborn than I'd ever have believed.","264694":"Though it is their own expedition they abandon, the Arctic Council shows no sign of contrition.","264695":"I am more worried than ever for the wellbeing of my husband's crew.","264696":"The Council's hubris coming here, expecting the unconquerable to be conquered!","264697":"How underprepared we are for mother nature! Only a seasonal lull gives us any hope at all.","264698":"My husband is a stubborn man, I only hope he was not too proud to heed the Inuit.","264699":"We have broken through ancient Ice, can I yet be hopeful?","264700":"These narrow channels will thicken solid, if we wait any longer.","264701":"How can they have survived in such a pitiless climate?","264702":"What if their provisions failed? Surely then they'd have been grateful for seals from the Inuit?","264703":"It was the Arctic Council who chose my dearest John, for all his flaws.","264704":"My husband's preparations were meticulous, I only hope he was willing to adapt them.","264705":"What snow-monsters lie in wait, I dare not speculate.","264706":"We must bridge with the Inuit. Perhaps they would trade?","264707":"Our survival hinges on partnership with the Inuit, we must reach out to them somehow.","264709":"The blinding whiteness. I hope I shall be worthy of its grandeur.","264710":"Dinner with the admiralty, is my sum experience of the Arctic, yet now here I am.","264711":"Stone cairns, and signs they camped in this very spot!","264712":"An auspicious place for us to make camp, knowing they too were here.","264713":"We must set up some chain of supply here— who knows how long a search will take.","264714":"Any provisions or equipment we can find will be beneficial to us!","264716":"Are we too late? Is it too late for us too now?","264717":"We are close, I sense them; my John - all of them.","264718":"Follow their aura, as others have done, and we can still find them.","264742":"If it takes our last breath we must find those walkers!","264743":"There is nothing more to be done now, but await the fate of the others.","264744":"That howling! They must long to be found!","264745":"We must strive onward, if it be the end of us.","264746":"This is the end, we must give ourselves to it fully.","264749":"We must trust the visions of the Inuit, and hope.","264750":"They must have been desperate to forsake the comfort of their cabins.","264751":"That John was not among them matters not, my belief has returned that he roams the ice yet.","264752":"Where are the bodies, if they are all dead?","264753":"Better to find skulls, than nothing at all.","264754":"We should dignify their memory with burial.","264755":"What madness caused them to forsake their equipment?","264756":"New life already clings to the wreckage of the old.","264757":"I can hear them, see their light everywhere!","264758":"The pole star gleams on bone.","264759":"The northland calls us through its open gate.","264760":"It's as if we are on a different plane, where souls reside.","264761":"The Inuit spoke of souls, I think I understand now.","264762":"We must hold fast, the truth will embrace us soon.","264771":"Skins can be sewn into clothing with bone needles.","264772":"You need a lot of good fat to reach the heart of ice.","264773":"So many sacrifices, but we have brought the survivors home!","264774":"That so many lives have been saved gives me hope anew.","264775":"I fear they went looking for the heart of ice. We have not seen them for a long time.","264776":"I can set you on a path, the rest is down to you.","264777":"If you tread carefully, then perhaps a way can be found.","264778":"That is the way. Their breath still hangs in the air.","264779":"Without belief, answers do not yet exist.","264780":"I don't know if your icebreaker will vanquish the ice, but we will not stand in your way.","264781":"None of us have much time.","264782":"You need to make the best of all you have.","264783":"Such strength can redeem your people.","264784":"This place is all-powerful, ever-changing, you have to adapt.","264785":"We have sighted vessels stranded in the channels. They too will be lost without help.","264786":"Better to let others learn from their own mistakes.","264787":"Your countrymen will soon become snowbound, and easy prey for Akhlut.","264788":"Those men underestimated this place, but you can show them their failings.","264789":"They will be glad to come back to light and hospitality, and think on their mistakes.","264790":"Seals are everywhere; know how to look for them.","264791":"Nanurjuk says they didn't seem right. They said little as if their tongues were cut.","264792":"They refused the seals we offered them.","264793":"They would not trade, or drink soup with us.","264794":"We built them a shelter, but they were already gone, deep into the ice.","264795":"Never have I seen beings so pale.","264796":"They went beyond the old ice, to a place of danger.","264797":"We are afraid Anguta has taken them to the underworld.","264798":"There are many ways to survive here, we have learned since childhood.","264799":"I will trade with you.","264800":"We were scared they were possessed by demons.","264801":"They brought sickness with them, and devilry.","264802":"We knew you would come for them, we have been waiting for you.","264803":"If these are indeed humans you pursue, I will do all I can to help you.","264804":"There are many things I could tell you, but I don't think they will help.","264805":"There are many sea mammals here, Sedna is their keeper.","264806":"We do not meddle in the business of others.","264807":"Don't expect to learn everything in a day.","264808":"The Council have praised our knowledge, but never respected it.","264809":"The vessels you seek are near yet far. Best prepare for terror.","264810":"If their vessels drifted to a dark place, maybe they are there still.","264811":"They could not have escaped the channels, you will find them there.","264812":"We too want answers, you are brave to keep digging.","264813":"This is a place of death. You can die here without knowing.","264814":"I will not go with you. I hope it is men you find, at the end of your journey.","264815":"When wise men die, the heavens lament.","264816":"You are on the last floe now, but the most fragile.","264817":"You have brought men back from the edge, you have earned our respect.","264818":"If you cannot save them, their souls will be trapped in the upper world to starve for eternity.","264819":"The lights in the sky cleave heads from the unworthy.","264820":"Where the ice between the dead and the living is thinnest, you float across.","264821":"I have no power to protect you, when you go to that place.","264822":"You have stirred the wrath of the moon!","264823":"Do not hunt alone, in darkness, or the wolf will take you.","264824":"This is a celestial place, be wary of taboo.","264825":"Fear this place, or it will take you smiling.","264826":"Nanook decides if you may hunt, or if you violate this place.","264827":"Inuksuk said he saw the white people carrying human meat.","264828":"I remember they were so dirty,  they had lost all humanity.","264829":"If you hear a whistling, it is their ghosts, trapped in the upper world.","264842":"I'm back from the dead, and I've brought friends.","264843":"Ain't you learned by now, I'm unkillable!","264844":"I decide when I die thank you.","264845":"This time, I'm going to get in with the right people.","264846":"We've rebuilt before, we can do it again.","264847":"The past is the past, the future is ours to protect.","264848":"You're going to need your best ship and crew, only for it to sink to the icy bottom! Hehehe.","264849":"Terrible waste of human life of course, but don't let that stop you.","264850":"And be sure to prepare for the final curtain while you're at it.","264851":"You really do have quite the desire to depart don't ya? Well it's your funeral.","264852":"Never mind, eh! At least you won't die a block of ice.","264853":"Seems a long way to go to die, but you look ready for it.","264854":"Take your time, won't make a difference to Sir John.","264855":"Congratulations! You crossed seven seas for a wasteland!","264856":"Couldn't even shoot yerself in the foot? Well I feel sorry for ya.","264857":"The whole expedition's a failure. But we all know that teamwork drivel's a myth.","264858":"See— never worth getting mixed up in other people's business.","264859":"What a waste of time! Just goes to show, you can't rely on others.","264860":"There's nothing up there but the  ruddy cold.","264861":"Hoping this will keep your head above water? Not Arctic water it won't.","264862":"Dunno why you're so desperate for your eyeballs to freeze.","264863":"At best we'll be pulling stiffs out the ice like teeth.","264864":"Like frostbite do ya? Botulism? Scurvy? Got that all to look forward to.","264865":"The Arctic's no more than a mariner's graveyard. Ooh, hang fire...","264866":"As we're here, we might ask the Inuits if they chanced upon any lost property...","264867":"The equipment won't have decomposed like the cadavers.","264868":"We've a responsibility to Sir John to gather up his valuables.","264869":"Hard to feel the cold when you see a glint, ain't it? Hehe.","264870":"Found nothing but emptiness, why isn't I surprised?","264871":"The deeper we go, the more likely we find something really juicy.","264872":"You want an Icebreaker, so we can get to the fancy stuff.","264873":"Never know what you'll find inside, if you don't crack things open.","264874":"Now we can finally see if Sir John bequeaths us summat shiny.","264875":"You need to grow yourself some tusks, my walrus-friend, or we'll never snag the goodies.","264876":"What d'you wanna help those old duffers for? Unless...you've sniffed summat out?","264877":"I've heard the Arctic Council ships are plushly furnished.","264878":"Shame they had to still be alive and we couldn't just help ourselves.","264879":"As long as their pocket watches still tick we should try afresh.","264880":"Never should o' come here, why do you think they call it a wasteland?","264881":"Looks like we'll have to dig up Sir John Faithful's army o' the dead another day.","264882":"Shame we couldn't find 'em, I was looking forward to expanding my collection of brass buttons.","264883":"Lady Faithful hopes to resurrect her marriage, but Sir John's got cold feet, hehehe.","264884":"Ice might even have helped preserve the merchandise.","264885":"I think we all know where Sir John Faithful is now, don't we? He's dead.","264886":"I know her old man’s long dead, but his lavish instruments won’t be, eh?","264887":"Don't be afraid to see the frozen look as you frisk their corpses, you’ll get used to it.","264888":"You can see a body a mile off out here, nice and exposed.","264889":"Knowing those old toffs, they'd probably skin each other before they'd skin a seal.","264890":"I 'spect there's a few nice bits and bobs suspended about the place.","264891":"Can't always wait til things are dead y'know...","264892":"No-one'll notice the odd body. If they're well-preserved, we could sell 'em for dissection.","264893":"Can't believe how much an Inuit'll give ya for a tarnished spoon, hehe.","264894":"I'd have come before, if I'd known how easy it is to fleece the locals.","264895":"If you're looking for the Hades and Styx, you're going in the right direction, hehe.","264896":"We can really milk this predicament for all it's got, as long as we're quiet.","264897":"Two years in a blizzard probably doesn't do your skin much good, does it?","264898":"Now, we don't want to look like we're only in it for the proceeds.","264899":"Now we're onto something. Let's hope for a shipwreck!","264900":"I hope those ships are stuck fast in the ice, free for the taking!","264901":"Ain't you wondering what's left of them ships?","264905":"Blimey, by foot!? This all looks very grim all of a sudden, doesn't it?!","264906":"Afraid? Never seen a real corpse?","264908":"If Lady Faithful thinks they're still alive let's humour the poor woman's delusion shall we?","264909":"Let's get to the bottom of this mystery, and what's become of 'em.","264910":"You'd think you'd seen a ghost, what's frozen yer?","264911":"Some of them live?! Brings a tear to an old man's eye.","264912":"Why d'you have to fade away before the final payoff!","264913":"Heavens what a name, no wonder their luck, eh?","264914":"You seem drawn to death, that's why I stick to you like fishglue.","264915":"This place is more indifferent to humankind than I am.","264916":"Cast your eyes about for any tidbits in the snow.","264917":"Lady Faithful's bewitched, she won't notice if we shuffle off for a bit.","264918":"A place so curious must have its curiosities…","264919":"What's all this endeavour of yours for?","264920":"A lot of furry animals out here.","264921":"These Inuit geezers are a help though, ain't they?","264922":"There are times even I give the dead their due.","264923":"Nothing but bone.","264924":"A sight to chill even someone as soulless as myself.","264925":"I think we could all use a tot of hot brandy.","264926":"Even I'd start to miss the sight of other beings out here.","264927":"We've come to a place of solitude.","264928":"I can't bear to watch you do this to yourself.","264929":"I thought you would end icebound too, but for your icebreaker.","264930":"Our planks stock reduces dangerously. We shall start producing our own construction materials now...","264931":"I love the scent of freshly cut wood, smells like a soon growing settlement. Very good.","264947":"Hello! I'm Hannah, your general advisor. I have some experience in building a company, which I'll share gracefully once you will have settled an island.","264948":"Hello! I'm Hannah, your general advisor. Welcome to your new home! This island will witness the beginning of our company, and I'll accompany you in this project.","264949":"Treading paths never trodden!","264950":"The thrill of discovering new horizons…!","264951":"Going on an adventure? Don't be scared if old Wibbly can also do it.","264952":"Going on an adventure? Don't be scared if old Wibbly can also do it.","264953":"We are in the middle of the sea right now. We need to settle an island to build our company. Find a huge island, that possesses all fertilities required for a good start.","264954":"We have our place now! Not bad, but it's only the beginning.","264955":"Yes, the island looks great, but don't waste more time. Start now with our company town. You need to build a settlement to attract some farmers. They will work in basic food and goods production.","264956":"Our small company city is buzzing. Farmers are flooding in the houses. They will keep gathering the core resources and goods we need.","264961":"I heard some complaints from the employees. They refuse to live in houses because they would not have any marketplace in the area. Please fix this situation!","264962":"Finally fixed. A market is the center of our city. Please remember it.","264963":"One of our production buildings is not able to deliver its goods anywhere. There should be a warehouse near every production area.","264964":"Organizing efficiently our production areas can bring us far. I'm glad the issue is fixed now.","264965":"The growth of our village triggers new demands from the farmers. Make sure to provide basic food and commodities to them, or they will leave us.","264966":"Fish does not smell good, but it does please our farmers. At least the view of the fish cargo delights me: it means more workforce, ultimately.","264967":"Our employees now are asking for schnapps. They would pay a lot for it, but this is no life requirement. They will just be a bit unhappy, that's all...","264970":"Help enough to demolish the larger ruins. Let's breathe some life into this place!","264971":"Father wouldn't have wanted us to sit on our hands while our one prospect was in such a state.","264972":"So let's gather our townsfolk and ask them to spruce the place up.","264973":"Mourning is eased now we have others for company sibling.","264974":"Your people are recovered, and desirous to proceed. Set them to it! We're going to need as much space as we can clear.","264976":"We must shelter the good, loyal people who have shown solidarity with our family.","264977":"We need every hand we can get if we are to expunge this debris.","264978":"It's been a hard day of labour for us all, we should cater to our tired, hungry people!","264979":"Let Uncle Edvard scoff. A modest island yes, but if you’re at all like Father, you’ll look beyond appearances.","264980":"Timber, very good. I’ll try not to think of the coffin.","264981":"He twists every article in his favour, at our and father’s expense!","264982":"It’s been a long, hard day. The people need to rest. And maybe wet their whistles.","264983":"What, still here? Establishing a rival company? On that dishevelled island?!","264984":"Do you remain here out of spite, or is this some futile attempt at competition?","264985":"Samuel's child, is it? Thank Heavens! I am so ashamed of every single word your uncle had me print.","264987":"Ah, Hannah remaining true to herself. Hello, I'm Aarhant, seems like you need an advisor for human-related issues. Don't listen to the bureaucrat, you should give your people what they want.","264988":"You have father’s fortitude! These people will follow you as they once followed him.","264989":"We have to set personal feelings aside and do as Edvard asks.","264990":"Speak to our humble cousin! He writes of a worker riot in Bright Sands.","264991":"It seems we are not alone in our contempt for Edvard.","264994":"Even I am astonished he could be this corrupt. We must put their cases before the highest authority, and hope for a retrial.","264995":"I am so relieved our legitimacy is no longer in question.","264997":"Hurry, I already smell the tar, see the masts a-swaying from father’s study!","264998":"Is there no limit to Uncle's shameless demands?","264999":"I feel sick to the stomach that Edvard could ask so much of us so soon after father's death.","265000":"That miserly, uncharitable…dastard! Picking and choosing what he inherits!","265002":"It cannot be...these names are those father trusted most; barristers, doctors, academics.","265003":"However much we despise Uncle Edvard, it's criminal to go opening his private correspondence!","265004":"He certainly knows how to silence his critics.","265005":"A letter. It bears Edvard’s seal!","265007":"As you are so desperate to appear responsible, you’ll be pleased to hear the cost of that fantastical funeral falls to you.","265008":"Your worthless rags have barely covered anything. Now bring me sails— it's not like you have any use for them!","265009":"Repay me now, or sell up!","265010":"Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, four bags full.","265011":"Good kid. Go on now, I'll let you know when I think of the next thing.","265012":"Don’t think you're finished, brat.","265013":"Well said! We have to focus on growth, not on comfort!","265014":"Your company, your policy... But be careful, angry employees may one day turn against you.","265015":"What a waste of hands... Efficient companies don't spend time on such commodities.","265016":"I totally support your decision. Making your people happy is the true sign of a good leader. Now we need to provide schnapps to these bored farmers.","265017":"Good. If you keep your employees happy, there is no way that they betray you. Oh, and it's always fun to mess up with Hannah. Remember that.","265018":"Oh you finally decided to provide this schnapps. Great. Happy employees don't think of rioting, instead they may become resourceful. We'll have an eye on it later.","265019":"Haven't seen a prison transport of mine, have you? If you do, be sure to return any salvage to me.","265021":"Don't even think about sheltering Samuel’s co-conspirators! Deliver them to prison at once, and I might lift your debt.","265022":"You have seen sense then. I suppose I shall have to inform Sir Archibald that your obligations are met.","265023":"Feels an eternity since the funeral— and the cost! Why it was extortionate!","265024":"I loathe the reek of lanolin, but if farmers smocks are all you have...","265025":"That was none of your business! And what right has the crown to meddle in my accounts? What right?!","265026":"Debt free? Spiffing, just the dib-dab. One splendid licence we shall draw up forthwith.","265027":"As to the debt my hands are tied, but it may warm her majesty's heart to see a new enterprise taking shape.","265028":"Did he really…? Oh dear, best leave these poor people with me. I will tell Edvard that the debt between you is quite settled…","265029":"If you pick me, you may have my boat! It's my poor aunt's legacy. Her second husband was a decent sailor.","265030":"Everybody on board? Good! I shiver at the thought of staying here another second…","265031":"Our city's historic first shipyard! We must document this moment in our first edition!","265032":"The perfect snapshot to illustrate history-in-the-making!","265033":"With several passionate young reporters enlisted, our publishing house is already well-underway!","265034":"Our editorial section is sure to grow along with your city. We are fine-tuning the first issue as we speak!","265035":"Think turning in sinners maketh you an angel? I know all about your family.","265036":"We’d rather die than stay. Our flags still wave for Samuel, let Edvard oppress us no more!","265037":"A life away from Edvard? We're on board! Only… we've no ship to get on board of!","265038":"We are, all of us, quite moved by your selfless actions. Your father would be proud.","265039":"Saved! Do you also then save us from a grievous injustice…?","265040":"Edvard’s charges against us are pure fabrication! The man is an impostor!","265041":"See what slander Edvard prints in Bright Sands!","265043":"The start of, if I dare presume, a most fruitful partnership!","265044":"How do you want farms to grow and raise anything? We need agricultural fields!","265045":"This scenery is so rustic. It really alters from the civilized cities. But well, our farmers have some occupation now!","265046":"I can already feel it... It's like in my dreams. Fire ravaging the city. It should not be complicated to have a fire station, or is it?","265047":"One is better than nothing, but I would feel safer if we had even more fire stations. But I should not ask too much of you...","265048":"Those houses are really too rustic... Would you mind making some renovation works?","265049":"Better housing means more qualified employees. With these workers, we will industrialize our settlement! Factory work is waiting!","265050":"Clearly Uncle's intention is to keep us from ever owning a shipyard.","265052":"Since each production building requires a specific workforce, make sure you have enough of each when you upgrade your houses. We still need some farmers.","265053":"Our dream of a shipyard is impossible without plenty of qualified hands.","265054":"Workers can handle stubborn debris on Ditchwater. If it's to be the centre of our new enterprise it needs to be immaculate.","265055":"Maybe Edvard will try to prevent us owning a shipyard, but for now let's at least house those workers.","265056":"Open the letter, he's clearly up to no good!","265061":"What is it you are bringing?","265062":"Hmm, a delivery? Dead or alive?","265063":"We are running low on timber, but there's plenty in the ruins. We should clear some to stock up.","265064":"Where are my sails!?","265093":"Our delivery driver complained that he can't access the Trading Post.","265094":"A good infrastructure is crucial to our success. Good that you improved it.","265125":"Done.","265127":"Screenshot taken.","265129":"Seriously? You're cheating?","265130":"For your information.","265131":"Game saved.","265133":"Praise checksum nine! Today is Anno day!","265134":"Will you be my Valentine?","265135":"Happy Easter!","265136":"Happy Holidays!","265137":"Merry Christmas!","265138":"Happy Halloween! Woooooo!","265139":"ANNO 1800 wishes you a happy new year.","265140":"Happy new year!","265141":"You earned a reward!","265142":"Warning!","265143":"You lost connection.","265144":"How about a cup of coffee? You have been playing for two hours.","265145":"It's four hours in a row! Time to strech your legs!","265146":"You've been playing for six hours already! Bet your empire will be fine without you for a moment or two.","265147":"You've been playing for eight hours now. You do know you can turn this off, don't you?","265148":"Time flies! It's been ten hours! And there is no time-based achievement to await you, honestly.","265149":"Twelve hours. Seriously? Turn the machine off this minute!","265150":"Twenty-four hours and the game is still running. You've reached the end of line. No more play time warnings. Let's hope you pressed fast forward and left for bed, so I am merely talking to myself right now.","265151":"Someone's cheating.","265152":"Decision required!","265153":"Player joined.","265154":"Player left.","265159":"You reached a new milestone!","265161":"Session unlocked.","265162":"New region unlocked!","265163":"New World unlocked!","265180":"The fire has been vanquished.","265181":"Your streets are safe again.","265182":"Your people are healthy again.","265189":"The strike has ended!","265190":"A fire broke out!","265191":"The fire is out of control!","265192":"The fire left ruins behind.","265193":"Your people are rioting!","265194":"This is turning into a revolution!","265195":"The revolt left your city in ruins.","265196":"Your people are starting to get sick.","265197":"The epidemic spreads across your city!","265198":"The epidemic left buildings abandoned.","265199":"People lay down their tools.","265200":"A general strike has been called on your island!","265201":"The strike left some buildings damaged.","265204":"The people celebrate your leadership!","265205":"The festival has ended!","265206":"A fire consumes one of your factories!","265207":"Illness grips one of your factories!","265208":"An explosion in one of your factories!","265210":"Ship under attack!","265211":"Your harbour is under attack!","265212":"Your

I like that!","265644":"An enemy's enemy and all that.","265645":"Skulduggery is second nature to us.","265646":"There are not many I can call friends.","265647":"If we people of principle don't support each other…","265648":"Hey, I'll play the trickster around here…","265649":"Hypocrisy is the only language the privileged speak.","265650":"Are you done kissing their feet?","265651":"Now that is a very clever thing indeed!","265652":"Do you need a lesson in manners from a pirate?","265653":"Well, that was rude.","265654":"At least try to keep your cards close to your chest!","265655":"I bet that will sting for days.","265656":"Wish I could have seen their face.","265657":"Please, don't let me stop you!","265678":"Certain traders are installed in the area. We should always have a look at what they offer for trade.","265679":"Keeping your employees happy may be highly rewarding.

Eurgh, stay away!","265783":"You do know Fortune is against the crown?","265784":"Fighting Miss Jorgensen?!","265795":"One more opposing the struggle for independence?","265796":"Your trust in Bente makes me want to trust you.","265807":"At least you're sympathetic to the struggle for independence.","265808":"Miss Jorgensen has a lot of friends, you know.","265810":"Pick a fight with someone your own size!","265814":"Oh don't you rough-up lovely old Carl! All fat an sweaty in his suit!","265820":"Ah, I know, she's lovely.","265822":"Funny how endearing that dimwit can be.","265826":"Then I'm not the only one who sees something in him?","265832":"Who would go against a goddess?!","265835":"George is a man of refinement!","265838":"Show him some culture, will you?","265844":"The mother, cradling the child.","265847":"George is the second most cultured person I know.","265850":"A boorish pair of hangers-on.","265856":"How dare you assail the noble Bente!","265858":"About time someone crunched that locust!","265860":"You know, that filthy sewer rat has a mean bite.","265868":"You too would like her favour, eh?","265870":"Two feathered twits bumping around the same coop.","265872":"Her sordid dynasty is somehow worthy of credit, isn't it?","265880":"Don't think you can have her skull…","265881":"Then the prows of your ships point east.","265882":"Yes, I can't wait for him to die.","265883":"Him?

Incredible.","265935":"A feral beast to be trussed and neutered.","265936":"We cannot allow La Corona to gain influence, can we?","265938":"Don't trouble yourself with such lowly enemies.","265947":"Raise flags with a lunatic? Unthinkable!","265948":"La Corona is a rival to my poor dear Queen.","265950":"Perhaps you can help the silly pariah.","265979":"George supported me, so I support him!","265984":"Make him suffer as he made my people suffer.","265991":"George is an ally you can rely on.","265996":"If you support Silva, you support La Corona.","266021":"A war with Auntie Maggs? Ohoho, you're done for!","266033":"Oh, Auntie Maggs'll look after you alright.","266036":"\"Numbers, statistics, reports. What might be a worry to you is my affairs! I'll stay close to you just in case you need support.\"","266038":"We are in the middle of the sea right now. We need to stand on firm ground.","266039":"\"A very decent island we have! But start roll up your sleeves. Our employees won't work without a decent housing.\"","266040":"That's a good start. We can grow even further, if we provide our employees with basic needs and better housing!","266041":"Our industry is running, but the revolt starts to brew and the complaints are lining up. Security and education are our priorities now.","266111":"We are failing!","266112":"Change is very slow!","266113":"We are trying our hardest!","266114":"It's a real struggle.","266115":"We are empty-handed!","266116":"Nowhere near our goal.","266117":"We have fallen far behind.","266140":"Those houses are really too rustic... Would you mind making some renovation works?","266146":"Is not my fault, eh!","266147":"Not enough, ya sé.","266148":"One of the worst years I can remember.","266149":"Something's gone wrong!","266150":"Believe me, we're trying.","266156":"I can't blame the machines!","266157":"Calculations are severely amiss!","266158":"What is the reason for this failure?!","266159":"We must revisit the manual at once!","266160":"Operation should have been simple!","266161":"I am a failure!","266162":"May as well finish me.","266163":"Nothingness.","266164":"I'm a useless donkey.","266165":"I've always been a dunce!","266166":"This production is cat-lap!","266167":"It's a right old bag o' nails.","266168":"If nothing works, might as well have stayed at home.","266169":"I won't be the scapegoat for this.","266170":"There's a whoppin' spanner in the works.","266171":"Fields fallow and barren.","266172":"I blame the soil.","266173":"A bad 'arvest","266174":"We're scrapin' the bottom of the barrel.","266175":"It's a snail's pace.","266176":"Some sort o' blight on us!","266177":"Land must be cursed!","266178":"If this place were a racehorse, you'd shoot it.","266179":"All I produce is tears.","266180":"This place is a void!","266181":"We would be better off with cave tools!","266182":"It does not yet function well.","266183":"The earth has given up on us.","266184":"It's looking pretty slim.","266189":"The board have faith in you to pull through, here's something to keep the fires burning.","266190":"Artisans are day dreamers, but their thirst for adventures could become very lucrative!","266191":"This whole new land has plentiful of products to offer. Our artisans will soon acquire the taste and skills of high society!","266192":"Our employees mastered the craft of electricity at the university. Modernity is at our door now.","266193":"We're finally here. Our engineers can craft the most luxurious products. We would become very prosperous.","266194":"I've never seen so much luxury ever before. We could start a big project where our investors would know how to spend their money?","266195":"Our monument is glorious. Imagine how many people would come to visit a great exhibition, and what marvels we could discover!","266196":"We're at the top of the world now. Well done!","266197":"A commission for the Royal fleet! And in such quantity! A rare honour indeed!","266198":"I find myself looking up to you, as the youngest often will.","266199":"So you build ships like your father? Well, the Queen is in the direst need of ships.","266200":"Supporting her will go some way to healing the wounds of the past.","266201":"These reinforcements will please Her Majesty! Though it remains my hope no war will be necessary.","266202":"The weaponry they ask for presents a problem. I'm not even sure we have an iron lode, do we?","266203":"Still have a few sticks of dynamite! We can blow our way through!","266204":"Ah, he’s here! Try to make a good first impression, eldest; any friend of father is a friend of ours.","266205":"Father used Mr. Ticker on account of his good sense. Go on, I suggest you find him in Bright Sands.","266206":"What are you both doing! Demolition is a serious matter wanting proper expertise!","266207":"I see the iron is beyond our reach. We have no choice but to find a way through the mountain.","266208":"Mr. Ticker has opened my eyes to the world of controlled destruction!","266209":"Perhaps not refined enough for your sister, but at least your workers can start their dig.","266210":"There was a chance while yer father still lived, no use dragging it out now he's gone…","266211":"Bright Sands will never be matched, if that's what you're set on.","266212":"You are trying at least. I know Samuel wouldn't have given up.","266213":"I'm starting to wonder if you can't turn things around.","266214":"You can't bring back your father, but his spirit…","266215":"I knew all along Father could never have taken his own life. But that someone willfully took his...!","266216":"The foul scent of a killer. We cannot let him escape.","266217":"Someone supplies the murderer from Madame Kahina's harbour? We should investigate.","266218":"I don't know what you're trying to achieve here, but it won't bring Samuel back.","266219":"Mining for you, mining for Eli , what's the difference?","266220":"Your father had that same steely look.","266221":"It's no Bright Sands, but it really is something!","266222":"Your company is flourishing. You may even be the match of your father, rest his soul.","266223":"Samuel Goode’s engineer? Aye, that’s me. Who’s asking?","266224":"Iron into Steel, Steel into Arms and we shall have fulfilled our first Royal commission!","266225":"There is no shame in producing weapons if it is in defence of the realm, eldest.","266226":"So I'm a commodity now, to be bought and sold? Your father treated me like a human being.","266227":"He is ready for transportation.","266228":"The locals say that trading ship over there belongs to a stranger. Maybe that's the supplier!","266229":"I can't think why he'd be worth anything. Everyone here is beyond redemption…","266230":"I'm not going to tell you your father wasn't a traitor.","266231":"I'd do anything to dodge Mr. Bleakworth's treadmill, but I'm not your expert.","266232":"Forget escape - and to what, Edvard's new vision for Bright Sands?","266233":"I was brought here along with Samuel. None of us knew why.","266234":"The way Mr. Bleakworth treats us, I don't blame your father for bowing out with his dignity.","266235":"Traitor or not, Samuel wouldn't have wanted his people to suffer for it.","266236":"Demolition? I could demolish a proper breakfast.","266237":"I was made to scrub Mr. Bleakworth's scabby back once.","266238":"Mr. Bleakworth relishes conducting lashings himself.","266240":"He freely admits to his crime! Get him!","266241":"No, he is dead! It cannot end here, we have no answers!","266242":"It is father's diary! Quickly, what does he say!?","266243":"Of course, the island over which he was accused of treason! That is what they are after.","266246":"The diary may not be enough in itself to convince Sir Archibald, but it may give him food for thought.","266247":"No doubt father thought this symbol germane. If anyone can interpret it, Madame Kahina can.","266248":"There must be some clue among the wreckage, anything!","266249":"It's empty!","266250":"Endless cloaks and masks!","266251":"Maggot-ridden!","266252":"An assortment to make the blood curdle!","266253":"The mark of the Pyrphorians. This sign of fire is reserved for those they wish death upon.","266254":"I never knew your father was mixed up with the Pyrophorians—a grave malevolence.","266255":"You may be wild, child, but don’t go to the new world, don’t rouse the dragon from its slumber.","266256":"I had believed it would only do harm to tell you, but I have grounds to believe your father was murdered.","266257":"And the killer, his cellmate, walks free! The rumour is he's in hiding, preparing to flee to the New World.","266258":"It is believed his accomplice supplies him with goods from the Emporium Exotique!","266259":"Who do we have here?! Samuel Goode's child. Want to go down with your father, do you?","266260":"Sarmento's last location is all we have. We need to plan our expedition route carefully.","266261":"This symbol is a death threat?! But Her Majesty received one identical! Upon a plain envelope, with a stamp from the colonies!","266262":"We still don't know how your father was involved in all this, but I fear the answer lies west.","266263":"Your father sold Prosperity to the leader of the rebels Isabel Sarmento.","266264":"Ever since the deal, Isabel has been hiding from us. But you may be the one to find her.","266265":"You're too late. I was just a spark, and the touch-paper is already lit...","266271":"The horsemen are coming!","266272":"You're going to need your Sunday clothes!","266274":"I'm in a daze…","266275":"Mamá, I am hungry…","266276":"Ah the old days…","266277":"Impossible!","266278":"Is the sun getting hotter!?","266279":"El infierno…","266280":"This is more hole than it is shoe.","266281":"It's better in the shade…","266282":"Señor, señor! A letter.","266283":"Ugh, I thought it was just mud…","266284":"I'd like something cold… ","266285":"¿Qué tal está usted?","266286":"We could use some rain.","266287":"Was I asleep that long? ","266288":"Padre, can we go a la playa?","266290":"The world feels alive today.","266292":"It's so good to be en casa!","266293":"Canta y no llores, sing, don't you cry!","266294":"I wish mi mamá could see this.","266295":"Qué maravilla…","266296":"¡Vivan los novios!","266297":"Here, have a good drink.","266302":"Spare a coin, amigo?","266303":"Your baby is so lindo!","266304":"What about the chick who abandons her nest?!","266305":"¡Ole!","266306":"Everybody is smiling.","266307":"The sea view never fails to calm me.","266308":"¡Es el paraíso…!","266309":"I hear the ocean singing…","266310":"I feel like a queen of the old world.","266311":"¡Bienvenidos! Makes yourselves at home!","266312":"There's the good, the bad, and the ugly…","266313":"We're in transition— you have to understand.","266314":"Niños, don't run around!","266315":"Is your tío feeling better?","266316":"Of course, you can eat some of mine.","266317":"Godspeed, mi buen señor.","266318":"I see a glimmer of hope.","266319":"I told you I won't put up with this.","266320":"We're leaving at first light!","266321":"Madre, why can't we go outside?","266322":"The dream is dying.","266323":"Nobody cleans these streets?","266324":"Remember La Corona? It's almost that bad.","266325":"This is no life.","266326":"Is it… safe to be this close?","266327":"I admit it's charming when they nuzzle.","266328":"What can be the purpose of those markings?","266329":"Fascinating, but I begin to feel peckish myself.","266330":"Does it look a bit dried up to you?","266331":"I happen to have seen these in the wild.","266332":"Surely, if they can jump that high, they…","266333":"I expected them to be larger in the flesh.","266334":"Come on, children, it's time to go.","266335":"I think we can bypass these…","266336":"It says not to touch.","266337":"Is there a label that says what it is?","266338":"Oh, interesting…!","266339":"They have gone to some effort.","266340":"Curious, certainly.","266341":"Might look nice in our drawing room. ","266342":"The facts laid bare.","266343":"Aha…!","266344":"Oh, is there more?","266345":"Perfect for a rainy afternoon.","266346":"And they say piracy's dying!","266347":"I'd go off the edge of the world for her.","266348":"Arrgh!","266349":"Drink up lad.","266350":"Show me that map…","266351":"Aye, scimitar's a good blade.","266352":"Live as if tomorrow will be your last!","266353":"She hit him so hard, he spat out his teeth.","266354":"…jellyfish took the Queen's pardon.","266355":"We can pick up more souls down south. ","266356":"Aye, a stump's all that's left of it…","266357":"No, I've got the curlier beard!","266358":"D'you remember doubloons?","266359":"Don't piss off old Annie, lad!","266360":"Pass the rum!","266361":"Whenever I see fire, I'm afraid.","266362":"We believe in Isabel.","266363":"An idea cannot be destroyed.","266364":"¡Esta tierra es nuestra!","266365":"Even if we are on the run…","266366":"Ever feel you're being watched?","266367":"I try to sleep, but it's too sticky.","266368":"More bullets, eh? We'll need them.","266369":"Always be ready, eh? Good girl.","266370":"Don't cast doubt on Isabel, bobo!","266371":"She is a beacon of hope.","266372":"My cousin is still imprisoned by La Corona…","266373":"Never know who's behind those masks.","266374":"Isabel will guide us to liberdade!","266375":"Hey, it's our principles that set us apart.","266376":"Isabel will never surrender.","266377":"I have a feeling something's wrong here.","266378":"Never know if someone's going to come for you.","266379":"I have seen cultists. Very creepy.","266380":"Sometimes I see torches on the move at night.","266382":"Dynamite fishing?! You're serious? Well, the village north is always short on food.","266383":"Remember when we escaped the pits back in the day? Still some dynamite left.","266384":"I hid it next to the abandoned lighthouse. Go fetch it!","266385":"Here it is! Just get plenty of distance on the throw.","266386":"The dynamite is at the lighthouse, old pal.","266387":"They're not expecting Queen Parrotfish; anything with fins will do.","266388":"All the blistered fish they could ever want.","266389":"A long sea journey won't make me give up my vow to stick by you.","266390":"I owe my life to you. You go, I follow, until I decide the debt is paid.","266391":"You never told me you had a sister, what else haven't you told me about?","266392":"Sometimes you have to face the past to have a future.","266393":"A bird with a spear would be faster.","266394":"You’re just destroying coral, you clown.","266395":"You couldn’t hit an cow’s arse with a sitar.","266396":"Even more roasted fish!","266397":"Still trying to get used to that smell of char.","266398":"You do have an eye for opportunity. After all, it’s not TNT the locals are short of.","266399":"Are we leaving on a packet ship, or has the wind blown through your ears again?","266400":"If it's you lighting the fuse, I'm going to keep well back.","266401":"Must be plenty of fish in this bay.","266402":"Don't look at me—dynamite was your idea.","266404":"With that first bang I knew it was you! So come show me what you got this time!","266405":"Ah! That burnt reek! Ugh! Hand over whatever it is and I'll help you get rid of it.","266406":"Here are your tickets. Hurry, drifters! The boat is leaving soon. And nobody wants you to miss it.","266407":"Fuera! I told you drifters before, rum don’t grow on trees.","266408":"When are you layabouts going to get a job?","266409":"What the chimichurri was that boom?","266410":"So loud the church bell is ringing!","266415":"Of course there is! I told you, we’re late!","266416":"No, only in 2D! They went and splurged the entire emergency budget on sausages for the Anno Union.","266417":"Are you crazy? No! We see this through! And stop calling me Tanya, I’m Bente—stay in character!","266418":"Ladies and Gentlemen! A very warm welcome to the dress rehearsal of \"\"The Jørgensens - The Musical\"\"'","266419":"Nope. I gave the libretto some welcome revision last night.","266420":"—And what, grandpa? Get with the program. The Anno series has its best moments behind it. The Jørgensens, on the other hand, are rising stars in the strategy universe. Rumour has it Ubisoft already plans a whole new franchise, with me at the helm.","266421":"How many times? It’s Bente, not Tanya, thickie!","266422":"With the teensy difference that we lack the pink tutu.","266423":"Too much info!","266424":"Shut up!","266425":"I think we get it.","266426":"We did. when archie says her majesty he means…","266427":"You are the nine / The only one / Without whom / We would feel so small","266428":"I did not believe / Thought it was a ruse / took for blasphemy / the obvious truth.","266429":"To be honest, none, your majesty.","266430":"Who, or rather what, are you?","266431":"I’m sorry Nathaniel, but in this condition it is impossible for you to take part.","266432":"No, just no.","266433":"You’re telling me! An evening of anno takes forever. Luckily most of us fast forward.","266434":"Just fast forward!","266435":"They all fast forward!","266436":"We fast forward, and forward…","266437":"Oh what now?!","266438":"No portrait, nothing, only a colour? He is not allowed to join!","266439":"You are player blue, / But no-one really gets to know you","266440":"This is getting ridiculous.","266441":"Shut it!","266442":"Damn thing!","266443":"It’s much too soon for me to be through!","266444":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266445":"How do you both look?","266446":"Oh, that! I like to wear it in private.","266447":"Poppycock! Don’t be such a prude. How do you know I haven’t been wearing a tutu all along? You only ever see my top half in-game.","266448":"What does everyone have against mein tutu? I think it’s time you all took stock... / I hereby solemnly confess: / I wear a pink tutu / From late at night till morning dew / I wear a pink tutu / I wear a pink tutu. / Yes, thank heaven above! / Avoid me, belittle me / but oh how it flatters me / And it fits like a glove. / I wear a pink tutu. / In contempt of my character rules / When I appear, It’s true / I wear most certainly / Something beneath made of tulle / I wear a pink tutu. / So before you begin to pooh-pooh / take time to scrutinise / please try to recognise / That I wear a tutu","266449":"No I refuse to be quiet / Now everything’s out in the light / If in the loading screen, the harbour, / or in the trading menu / forever I’ll wear a tutu!","266450":"Good, then we can begin.","266451":"I did not know the queen was part of this. I thought we cut that witch out?","266452":"Oh golly-gosh, the nine!","266453":"quite feeble and small","266454":"The magic lies in the checksum","266455":"I thought we looked shit!","266456":"Nothing personal chum, but you look unspeakable.","266457":"No!","266458":"A shame he has taken it so badly. He thinks anno is so boring—he was really looking forward to the musical.","266459":"He simply clicks fast forward!","266460":"Then he fasts forward!","266461":"They all fast forward!","266462":"We fast forward, and forward…","266463":"No, wait. something’s wrong. The lighting should be  different somehow. The sun should be…","266464":"Where’s the ambulance?","266465":"No name to set things straight / The concept is rather hard to relate","266466":"Anyone have a light?","266467":"No! mein tutu! / Oh horror! Oh pain! / All we see is made of paper!","266468":"All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?","266469":"All of it burns, my pink tutu!","266470":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266471":"ME! You said it worm, kneel before the one true god of anno!","266472":"/ 1800 / 1602 / In every game / I shelter you / 1701 / 1404 / Each anno game / Is just the same","266473":"Enough of your grovelling! Rise Mortals! / Now, which role do you see for me in your little drama?","266474":"Your attempts at flattery are futile. I am going to pwn a game of 1404 now. When I get back this will be “checksum 9: the musical” or you will feel my holy wrath.","266475":"The moral of the story is simple. Without me, it doesn’t work. See you in Anno 1305!","266476":"There you are. I thought you may have begun without me.","266477":"But… I’m Old Nate! don’t you recognise me?","266478":"Don’t do this to me! You know how I love musicals.","266479":"I know, / a lowly intern painted me / And he was badly paid / I know / I have no proper face / And now I look like a disgrace / I know / A lowly intern cobbled me / The team just stood and laughed. / I know / for colour there’s no money in the purse / And the midday sun / ensures I look ten times worse","266480":"Please say, that i am “in”. / My heart it breaks in twain. / And If, I cannot sing, woe! / What will I do then, oh? / Come now, shake my hand!","266481":"Yeah / I saw the whole thing coming / Now it’s time for me to go. / Dear mother she was a sketching book / And even she loathes how I look","266482":"Oh… there’s already someone out there!","266483":"How do you look? I’d presumed we would be fully rendered here…","266484":"Darnation! I always said this union business was a nonsense! And that we are to look shabby-chic because of it?! Whatever next, my dear Tanya? Shall we abandon it all?","266485":"Not \"Anno 1800 - The Musical\", then?!'","266486":"Er...I’m not sure if her Majesty would approve. Perhaps over tea at the palace we could discuss your designs and—","266487":"Oh dear Tanya, please can we stick to…","266488":"Equally as flat as you are.","266489":"But we are not in private! You are here in the role of Anno-A.I! Carl Leonard von Malching—ill-tempered industrialist!","266490":"One moment, her majesty has not arrived yet.","266491":"quite feeble and small","266492":"The magic lies in the checksum","266493":"We could never have dared hope you would participate in so irreverent a trifle.","266494":"To be honest, no…","266495":"No!","266496":"But the game is jolly boring. Half the time I’m asleep before anyone discovers my island!","266497":"When your ship has you snoring / When the waiting is boring / I click fast forward!","266498":"Is my island warehouse bare? / Is that just too hard to bear? / then I fast forward!","266499":"Simply just fast forward!","266500":"We fast forward, and forward…","266501":"I think the sun is burned-out.","266502":"You don’t recognise it? I jest not, this is how we looked in 1602.","266503":"Oh so true! It’s far too much blue!","266504":"Oh horror! Oh pain! / Who came up with this stupid play!?","266505":"All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?","266506":"Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.","266508":"Did someone call for me?","266509":"So it’s my fault again?","266510":"What should I be?! Say it! What is it this time? Should I hang lower in the sky? Should I turn with you? If I ever make it into the game without one person complaining I’ll eat my hat. Come on then you bright sparks, gift me an entry in the options menu, this wheelie-bin for half-finished features. Or even better! How about a day-night cycle, huh? Then every five minutes I can cede my throne to a rotten cheese!","266511":"Peeps, in the old days nobody needed that. The world was in 2D. Everybody was happy that they could see anything at all.","266512":"If only father were here, he'd have known what to do.","266515":"It is not nearly as moribund here as it was.","266516":"Those still loyal to Father will now turn to you.","266517":"A moving tribute to see so many loyal to father trust in you.","266518":"At such times it is good to occupy oneself with routine things.","266519":"I'm sure you know, but father was innocent.","266520":"We must behave as if father were acquitted, as one day he will be.","266521":"Aarhant is proving wise counsel. I'm glad you managed to make a friend while you were away.","266522":"In times such as these, it is good to have people around us.","266523":"I'll dream of Bright Sands until the day I can dream no more.","266524":"A cloud still hangs over this place, please make it go away!","266525":"She has you doing all those chores you tried to leave behind.","266526":"Everything depends on this enterprise for your sister, I won't watch you let her down.","266527":"You're better with humankind than I used to believe.","266528":"First the weather, now the people!","266529":"It is not rain, but wet mist! And endless! What are we doing here?!","266530":"Disrespectful chatter abounds about your father and how he died.","266531":"Sometimes feels like your sister hardly knows you.","266532":"The tin rush left this island ugly.","266533":"Funny to watch you get your hands dirty.","266534":"So serious all of a sudden. Where’s that old spirit of yours gone?","266535":"You'll not have a dribble of inheritance after all your frivolity out in god-knows-where.","266536":"Prosperity's sale is a disaster for the Empire, the Queen has said as much to me herself!","266537":"Prosperity, sold to New World rebels, can you imagine?!","266538":"Did you expected a fatted calf to be slaughtered on your return?","266539":"You must now see, no-one wants you here.","266541":"I feel as crushed and obsolete as yesterday's front page.","266542":"Nothing I say has any influence on Edvard, I am his doormat.","266543":"They're at the gates!","266545":"Take cover! ","266546":"Over there, shoot!","266547":"It's everywhere, help! ","266549":"Why us!?","266550":"We've nowhere to run!!","266551":"This way, hurry!","266552":"Someone, please help me!! ","266553":"Were Sir John's maps inaccurate...?","266554":"What were they thinking, sailing into the ice...","266555":"I'll never have enough of this Inuit jerky!","266556":"Who's there!? ... Mind's playing tricks on me...","266557":"If it weren't for the Inuit...","266558":"It doesn't bite, does it...?","266559":"The Inuit can see beyond the ice!","266560":"The artic council are cowards...","266561":"Hurry, someone's buried in the snow!","266562":"I just hope the bears stay away...","266563":"Never thought I'd get sick of daylight.","266564":"We need rope and as many axes as you can get.","266565":"If we'd gotten there just one minute later...","266566":"I wouldn't trust the artic council with my blisters... ","266567":"We must prepare for everything and anything.","266568":"I only hope we find them alive...","266569":"About time we saw some chaos!","266570":"The denizens of night have returned to their crack in the wall, for now.","266571":"Don't let those Pyrphorians near my vases!","266572":"A trial? How unspeakably sordid!","266573":"Fight the Pyrphorians with love! They will beg you to stop!","266574":"I feel sorry for the Pyrphorians. What drives people to be like that?","266575":"My urchins have known for months this was coming!","266576":"Open war wasn't their style now, was it? But you know they won't be gone forever dearie!","266577":"Bring an end to this age of terror!","266578":"Two flawed men. But there was good in them, as there is in you.","266579":"Shades pour from the earth! We will be overrun!","266580":"Two tattered flowers showered with tears give life to a meadowfull.","266583":"Edvard becomes a monster inconceivably grotesque, but one we, for now must keep fed.","266584":"As this letter proves them innocent, let us hurry to Sir Archibald.","266585":"For almost the first time since he passed, eldest, my heart is lifted.","266586":"Building a shipyard is no small matter, our work is far from finsihed.","266587":"Father would be ashamed to see his brother now.","266588":"I shall not be content with any ship, until I can say it is one we ourselves have built.","266589":"The ship is another serendipity we should be grateful for.","266590":"I could hire these Pyrphorians as mercenaries—defeat that nuisance Sarmento.","266591":"Hmmn I wonder if fire could fit in with my strategy...","266592":"You unstoppered the bottle and let the menace loose!","266593":"I was worried for a while there would be no Queen to grant me my baroncy.","266594":"The Pyrphorians! Don't come for me, I'm really low class!","266595":"You must have fed off my resilient aura there, driving the P-p-pyrphorians away.","266596":"Why does everyone want a piece of the Queen now?","266597":"I'm sure I recognised something about that grandmaster.","266598":"Blow away the shadows, for all our sakes.","266599":"Ruthless when you had to be, I like that. The world is rid of a great evil.","266600":"I beg you, I don't want to live in a world of Pyrphorians. Make them go away.","266601":"Phew! That's one less threat to our survival that I have to take care of!","266603":"A shame Edvard never had a taste of real justice.","266604":"I had been looking forward to putting Edvard's head through the noose. Never mind.","266605":"Surely there is someone to punish for all of this!?","266606":"Though the burden is lifted, Edvard will keep you headlocked for life if you allow him to.","266607":"Edvard has shown his weakness as a leader. We must exploit it.","266608":"This is our chance to show Edvard who rules the waves.","266609":"Sometimes doing the wrong thing is the right thing, old pal.","266610":"Why would we need a licence to build a boat? Seems that's how it is here...","266611":"Once this shipyard is built, we can gesture rudely at Edvard, and go back to adventuring.","266612":"She says it's ''your'' shipyard? Does that mean we're going to be here forever?","266613":"All I smell on your Uncle is greed.","266614":"Don’t grovel for your Uncle. He has no power over you.","266615":"You do know Edvard has no intention of lifting that debt?","266616":"Since that day you saved my life, I have presumed I knew you. But now...","266665":"We are broke, old pal! We can’t afford passage back to the old world, back to your family! Not unless you’ve suddenly remembered what work is.","266696":"Our father is accused of high treason. Dare you to believe it? Arrested, stripped of his knighthood. We… I am terribly shaken, and the vultures are already circling.","266715":"Will you now stand by, knowing gentle father is imprisoned? It must kill him. Please come home. We need you.","266716":"Edvard registered the debt officially?!","266717":"What? Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to abducting my workers? The Queen’s ambassador himself shall hear of this.","266719":"And if I may—excuse me—a false one. We left Edvard quite willingly.","266720":"Don’t worry, that old tyrant can’t hold us back anymore!","266721":"Now that sounds like good news.","266722":"Abduction is a severe accusation...","266723":"I see nothing criminal. A bit of interfamilial bickering is only natural, and hardly a matter for the crown.","266724":"And as for you, I have quite forgotten my manners. Sir Archibald Blake, ambassador and confidant to the Queen. Despite the circumstances, Her Majesty and I were pleased to hear of your return. Your father’s death was a tragedy; we regret he never had the chance of a fair trial.","266725":"Sadly your Uncle has indeed alerted me to some floating liabilities. I fear you have no choice but to settle them if I am to grant you your crown shipping licence.","266726":"Indeed! Once my letterpress is up and running, the truth will come back to haunt Edvard! For your hospitality, please, use my ship howsoever you may wish!","266727":"Pencil-polishing popinjay! I should have been rid of you long ago!","266728":"The real tragedy here is the vast funeral bill that goes unpaid, while this brat is living the life of O'Reilly!","266729":"Boom!","266731":"A shame you can't appreciate the craft this requires. Never mind, the charges have been primed, the perimeter cleared, we are ready to detonate.","266732":"Who are all these busybodies? Blowing up rocks can't be that complicated!","266733":"Ha! My apologies, that was indeed impressive! Is there anything dynamite won't solve, I wonder?","266735":"So, you found us. Take a look around. What can the henchmen of the Empire do to us that the Pyrphorians haven't already?","266736":"Please, Miss Sarmento, we come here only to prove our father innocent—Samuel Goode.","266737":"Goode? The man that sold Her Majesty's precious island to me? He is just as guilty as I am!","266738":"So you are calling me a liar? Love is blind. Back before they left their fiery mark, the Pyrphorians told me your father would come— to sell me Prosperity.","266739":"I knew conspiring against the Empire was a bad idea. Afterwards, when I refused to work with the Pyrphorians, they came to teach us a lesson.","266740":"Now our movement drills their oil for nothing, night and day. We have lost the strength to fight.","266741":"Still we are afraid. And even though we buried the dead and found a hideaway, I cannot provide shelter for all of them.","266742":"So you won't let go? Then let's get to business. Help me shelter and protect the good people that are part of this movement. If I see you can be trusted, I will find you the contract that sealed the deal on Prosperity. Are you in?","266743":"I don't know about you, but my father would never have betrayed his Queen!","266744":"We are very sorry to hear your situation, still I must insist our father's...","266745":"How long can it take to peel a potato?","266746":"Where is my sausage!?","266747":"Are you darning the things yourself?","266748":"The longer you wait, the less inclined I shall be to write off your sizeable debt.","266749":"A few bottles of bathtub booze?","266750":"Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to theft?","266751":"I will let Edvard know that I have granted you your shipping licence.","266752":"We also hear on the grapevine, of your commendable intention to establish your own shipping company…","266753":"Her Majesty warmly invites you to trade in sovereign harbours, at your own discretion of course.","266759":"I know, it's not much of a ship, but this is no time to be picky.","266760":"Your father always saw to it that we had rights and unions and all that gubbins.","266761":"Shame what happened to your father. We'll stand by your side!","266762":"We will follow you as we followed Samuel!","266763":"Ready to leave Bright Sands behind!","266764":"If you're only half your father, you're way beyond Edvard!","266765":"Your uncle is nothing like your father! We'll follow you!","266766":"I know we look like criminals, but we were trusted associates of your father.","266767":"Granting such a prestigious commission shows the council may be willing to give us fair hearing.","266768":"The last moneys I spent on Ditchwater appear well spent, eldest—and the faith I invested in you.","266769":"This could be the start of something significant for us.","266770":"I'm sure if we have iron deposits, you can find them, eldest.","266771":"If the royal fleet is to be at the cutting edge, we must start producing steel.","266772":"Steel! How proud father would be.","266773":"You have put in as much hard work as anyone else!","266774":"To outfit our ships, we're going to need to fashion all that steel into weaponry.","266775":"Perhaps we should sell ships to partners father trusted.","266776":"I predict inexhaustible demand for our steel!","266777":"We are the beating heart of industry in the Empire.","266778":"Exactly the sort of mischief I remember you by.","266779":"Mr. Ticker has years of experience in detonations, we must secure his services.","266780":"Who would kill such a gentle man? Why?","266781":"Always dangerous, getting wrapped-up in the business of a Queen.","266795":"My bond is to you, not to your monarch.","266796":"You're part of it now, just like your father was.","266797":"Once you reach the top, there's only one way from there.","266798":"I'm still waiting for the boom!","266799":"I suppose it is better to let the experts handle it.","266800":"My sword is fashioned from Ukku steel, but to produce in these quantities!","266801":"This steel will command great value.","266802":"I never imagined a city could grow so fast.","266803":"You're a real fat cat now! Hope you remember one day how you got here…","266804":"The workers may as well start preparing for the detonation.","266805":"Admit it, you’d never have hired a demolition expert in the old days.","266806":"Fizzle, fizzle, boom! Hahaha.","266807":"The way to the iron mines is clear!","266808":"Perhaps you can help me understand who keeps a murder under their hat? Forgive me, I know we speak of your father…","266809":"I read in the papers you build ships like your father. His actions have likely led to war, so it would be strangely fitting if you were to supply the Queen's fleet.","266810":"You are doing Her Majesty a great service in these difficult times.","266811":"How are those ships coming along? Her Majesty will be pleased.","266812":"Her Majesty wants only warships. It is after all important in such times that she defends her sovereignty.","266813":"We rely more and more on captains of industry to steer us to happy futures.","266814":"You're stubborn, that's for sure. A chip off the old block.","266815":"So you're the one that fled his duties. Well you're too late, there's nothing to be done.","266816":"You realise this will be no palm-tree paradise, only hard graft?","266817":"My wife tells me I shouldn't be so hard on you.","266818":"You're brave coming back, many people blame all this on you.","266819":"Samuel always had high hopes for you. It was a great blow to him when you left.","266820":"My prison outfit remains in protest.","266821":"Edvard is the major cause of my distemper, not you.","266822":"Somehow got used to these pyjama stripes.","266823":"Dead or alive, I’ll always be Samuel’s man.","266824":"I realise I should have told you sooner.","266825":"Perhaps now you have the means to take justice into your own hands.","266826":"Ah, the prodigal child. Epitome of selfishness.","266827":"It'll take a lot to convince me you're worthy of the name Goode.","266828":"You never know what you have til it's gone, eh?","266829":"Give me a reason to forgive you.","266830":"Murdered? You are joking, surely!","266835":"There was a time when I took any opportunity that came my way, just like you.","266836":"Through all the smoke, I see a glimmer in you.","266837":"Choose your customers, don't let them choose you.","266839":"Oh do stop, Archie. Is this tiny fleet all I have to sink to get my island back?","266840":"Who are you, to speak up without permission?","266841":"So Edvard is the traitor! I certainly never authorised that silly-billy to act on my behalf. I declare the contract null and void.","266842":"Then I suppose we'll not be sinking any ships today. Not even as a deterrent?","266843":"Well in that case I hereby declare Prosperity returned to the Goode children—to compensate the dead father, thereby ensuring Miss Sarmento and co. are safe from this Pyrphorian nuisance.","266844":"I don't do favours for the children of traitors. Or does that look tell me you're willing to pay…?","266845":"I'm sure it won't be too long before Edvard contrives to have him back in prison.","266846":"I don't care why Edvard sent them here. That's his business.","266847":"Your father's death was a routine suicide. We get them all the time.","266848":"Nothing in this prison escapes my notice, if there was any funny business with your father's death I'd have known about it!","266849":"Isabel Sarmento, Her Royal Highness The Queen requires you to give up your iniquitous seizure of Prosperity, an island which, by no means...","266850":"Er… this is one of the Goode children I mentioned. A little forward, but surprisingly helpful so far!","266851":"Terribly sorry, your Majesty, but I fear not.","266853":"Then we too were betrayed. We will leave Prosperity immediately, your Majesty.","266854":"They are more than a nuisance! And they will never accept this. You must be careful!","266860":"You look into this, eldest. I'm not sure I can face it.","266874":"This is what we wanted after all. To know the truth.","266875":"What could he have meant, eldest? I fear this mystery is only just begun.","266876":"I now have more questions than answers.","266877":"Father's killer was a nobody. Something greater conspires against our family.","266878":"Oh we are swept up in something now, eldest. And I am coming with you…","266879":"I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering such mysteries.","266880":"I wonder if Sir Archibald knows of this Pyrphorian threat? I think we have enough here to beg his consideration again…","266882":"Where is the contract that would be official proof of Prosperity's sale?","266883":"Be careful, eldest.","266884":"It relates the sale of the island Prosperity—the very reason father was branded a traitor.","266885":"We cannot let the truth sink into the murk!","266886":"Father’s own hand! Now we shall know his mind, eldest.","266887":"Don’t be afraid to ask Madame Kahina, she became a good friend to father.","266888":"Kahina is acquainted with the new world, she is sure to have seen this symbol before.","266889":"All we have is Isabel’s last-known hideaway, and a world of unknowns in between.","266890":"Prosperity is the cause of all this trouble. I already despise that wretched place.","266891":"I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering mysteries.","266892":"If you are going to do this, I am coming with you.","266893":"At last the expedition has found Miss Sarmento. Let us hope she makes our journey worthwhile.","266894":"Maybe nothing need be sunk at all, majesty!","266895":"Regard here, your Majesty! The Prosperity contract and our father's diary. The signatures do not match!","266896":"And now compare with a freight document by our uncle Edvard. Do you see? He forged the signature in order to impersonate father!","266898":"We hear you Isabel, but first we return to Bright Sands and confront uncle Edvard. His wicked masquerade is over!","266899":"A tiger must stay low and close to his prey.","266914":"Still your rage. The trail may not end here.","266915":"There, that must be the villain's ship!","266916":"Keep a good distance, but don't let the wretch slip away.","266917":"Your father's testament is clear! No guilty man would write with such confidence!","266918":"He has nowhere to go.","266919":"There is the ship. Let's keep our distance, see where it goes.","266920":"His words are a warning. Whoever our nemesis is, they are many steps ahead.","266921":"He is dead?","266922":"Gather your things Edvard. For your trial.","266923":"No!","266924":"Samuel will forgive you on the other side, Edvard!","266926":"After the excellent work you are doing for the fleet, I think you're entitled to pursue the odd personal matter.","266931":"I wish as much as you that your father were innocent in this.","266932":"Those very serious accusations against your father are hard to dismiss without proof to the contrary.","266933":"The sale of Prosperity, made in Samuel's name, has weakened Her Majesty's position greatly.","266934":"You digging around in state matters isn’t ideal, but in this case may be necessary.","266935":"That these ''Pyrphorians'' may have spread their influence in the New World is grave news indeed.","266936":"The situation closer to home is already difficult. Her Majesty has come under increasing scrutiny from many sides.","266937":"Her Majesty may go to war with Isabel. That is why she is mustering a fleet.","266938":"Isabel will be cagey, but I think she with time may listen to us.","266939":"Isabel may not trust you to begin with. But remember, neither did I!","266940":"You may find Isabel fiercely independent. But I trust in you to bring her round.","266941":"I fear Her Majesty will not care to know the difference between these Pyrphorians and the local rebellion. So we'll have to leave that to you.","266942":"I wish you the best, for Queen and country!","266943":"No, child. It's too late. Judgement has already come.","266944":"I am.","266945":"No please, don't be afraid. It's time to let go. My ship has sailed...","266946":"Look! Devils from below breathing fire and flame!","266947":"We are not afraid of cowards hiding behind masks.","266948":"Their fleet is formidable. I count many ships.","266949":"Yes, Grandmaster! Gladly.","266950":"Edvard Goode. Are you ready to be reunited with your brother?","266951":"Of course you are. The heat will peel your sins from your flesh like cloth. Acolytes, purge the place!","266952":"Pathetic! But then, surely Samuel awaits you too! The whole Goode family can be reunited in the everlasting. We squeezed the life from your father's lungs, peeled your uncle's skin...You must be curious as to what we plan for you!","266953":"A new world order is at stake— the Empire already shaking to its foundations, and the Goode family helpless to prevent it! We first eradicate the offspring and then eradicate the Queen!","266954":"No surprise to hear criminals are drawn here, they go where the money goes.","266957":"A lot of strange people like to meet in my harbour. That's the nature of the business.","266958":"Too many shadows to know where one starts and another begins.","266959":"Don't be stubborn like your father. Stay away from the new world, Prosperity—it is the source of all your troubles.","266960":"Your father was one of the few honest traders.","266961":"Your father was a dear friend to me. To think the killer hid himself in my harbour…","266962":"Smoke rises on the horizon. A threat emerges.","266963":"Your father was singled out. The Queen's most trusted. I know how these schemes work.","266964":"The Pyrphorians keep themselves very secret. They may be watching your every step!","266965":"The Pyrphorians are an arcane sect. Invisible, yet everywhere.","266966":"What is that tinseled marionette talking about, Archie? We are safe here, aren't we?","266971":"As safe as the situation allows, highness.","266972":"Oh you are awfully right, old chum. I beseech you, we must protect Her Majesty at any cost!","266980":"They will come for you, for everybody!","266981":"Killing your father was easy…","266982":"Want to go down with your father, do you!","266983":"The wildfire catches… it catches!","266984":"The sixth age of man approaches!","266985":"We are the firebringers!","266986":"We mortals shall take back the earth!","266987":"Look at all those subjects! How enthusiastic they seem! Do you think they celebrate me, their royal highness?","266988":"And you are absolutely sure this Samuel Goode was innocent?","266989":"Let's heal it then, and be off.","266990":"My sincerest condolences, children of Samuel. For the loss of the father you loved, and for the tragedy caused by the unfortunate actions of your uncle.","266991":"For your unquestionable loyalty and bravery you shall be knighted, and bequeathed the island of Bright Sands from now and forevermore!","266992":"Hahaha... Forgive me, I always laugh at funerals!","266993":"In a manner of speaking, your Majesty, in a manner of speaking!","266994":"No doubt, your Majesty—mustn't worry. Your attendance at this ceremony is nothing short of sublime. A gesture of the uttermost nobility that can heal this tormented place.","266995":"I fear Majesty, it is time we were on our way...","266996":"See! Her Majesty is paying her last respects, just as Archie promised!","266997":"From now on they rest side by side in the family vault.","266998":"She is...","266999":"Bright Sands is returned to us, father's name is cleared. So, that will be all, eldest. Will you and Aarhant be leaving?","267000":"I'll do anything to know the truth, even if it mean dealing with Isabel's rogues.","267005":"I will not be fooled, Aarhant. I know that we shall one day be parted. But if my prayers be answered, today will not be that day— dearest sibling? Today is not a day for parting.","267006":"Yes, just look at her. I bet she already forgot who we are.","267007":"They are at peace now.","267008":"...the Queen. She's the Queen.","267009":"After all we've been through?","267010":"As it stands, they are an easy target for the Pyrphorians. We should help, eldest.","267011":"You have done more to protect her people than Isabel could possibly have hoped, eldest.","267012":"From what we know of the Pyrphorians, I don't think it's enough yet to deter them.","267013":"Prosperity—I want to see the island that caused all this with my own eyes.","267014":"Then the Pyrphorians wanted Prosperity for the oil. No doubt to keep their fires burning.","267015":"I think we can ask anything of Isabel with her people sheltered, defended and now supplied.","267016":"This is about as much as she can ask for.","267017":"Isabel is showing genuine gratitude. Perhaps she isn't the sort I thought.","267018":"For the first time in my life, I know freedom.","267019":"Isabel claims to know the whereabouts of the contract, and it is the only trail we have.","267020":"I am so glad we are finally seeing the world together, eldest.","267021":"There it is— Prosperity. The source of all our troubles.","267022":"These fires cannot be due to the warm climate.","267023":"The firemen confirm it was arson! These fires were set upon us!","267024":"This monstrous fire-raising is deliberate. The Pyrphorians!","267025":"Isabel is mistaken. I won't hear these lies about father.","267026":"Why has Isabel not yet given us the Prosperity contract? She is worryingly elusive on the subject.","267027":"Isabel plays on our emotions. Still, if the sick could be carried to La Isla to convalesce…","267028":"A messenger boy has brought us a letter.","267029":"It is in Isabel's interest we find that contract! The Queen will realise Sarmento was forced into the deal.","267030":"What do you do here at the family crypt, Edvard? Do you vaunt your betrayal?","267031":"Enough! It was you who sold Prosperity for the Pyrphorians! You forged father's signature! You sentenced him to death! But now the sentence is on you, uncle!","267032":"And your guilt shall long outlive you, uncle. Look what you've done to our family.","267035":"What are you talking about, child? Only words between brothers, that's all.","267036":"From the moment I saw you, I knew it meant trouble.","267037":"I knew this would happen. I was just saying to your father, I'll never come up to him—not even having sacrificed it all.","267038":"He never understood the pain, of my life in his shadow.","267039":"I can't be scared. No more than I am already.","267040":"The Pyrphorians are pure evil. I thought I had control of this frightful arrangement, but when they murdered Samuel, I realised a day would come that they came for me too. The day they purge this decaying Empire with fire and flame.","267041":"Lo and behold, Her Majesty! Finally, I become worthy of her notice.","267042":"Yes. Guilty as charged.","267070":"Build us a haven on La Isla, and we can talk about getting you that contract.","267075":"We will help you. But first you have to help us.","267076":"The Pyrphorians would only exploit us if we tried to resettle ourselves. But with an island under your flag…","267077":"This place is more than good enough for us. We are used to living on very little.","267078":"They are mostly just civilians, hoping for somewhere they can feel safe.","267079":"This can be our fortress. A beautiful garden away from terrible things. We must protect it.","267080":"Once this is over I promise to repay you. Right now, I care about my people's safety!","267081":"We must be ready for the Pyrphorians if they come.","267082":"You could make the resistance yet! We are grateful to have such security now.","267083":"You're doing amazing work. Together we will fight them with everything we have!","267084":"Now you can focus on La Isla. Securing the future of men, women, and children!","267085":"Prosperity has been nothing but trouble for us. Go see for yourself.","267086":"My followers on that island are living in fear!","267087":"The persecuted, the diaspora, flock to La Isla. We must shelter them.","267088":"We need to be able to hold out should the Pyrphorians strike. Anything you can provide will help.","267089":"I feel bad for asking. But these people come here pockets empty.","267090":"This place, La Isla, can be a fortress of salvation to these people.","267091":"I didn't know if I could trust you. But you have given these people hope, and a future.","267092":"We must get the people what they need, before the Pyrphorians can break our supply lines.","267093":"Your father was guilty. I was with him when he signed the contract.","267094":"I wouldn't be surprised if the Pyrphorians pressured your father too.","267095":"The Pyrphorians took Prosperity from us the moment that deal was signed.","267096":"Helping you is too risky right now. My people need shelter from the Pyrphorian menace.","267097":"We had no choice. The Pyrphorians coerced us into buying Prosperity from your father.","267098":"Prosperity is so rich in natural resources. No wonder it is the source of all this conflict.","267099":"We want to forge something new, break away from the old.","267100":"I trust your Empire no more than the Pyrphorians. We are just pawns in their game.","267101":"Break free of La Corona, only to land in the lap of these Pyrphorian devils.","267102":"They will torch the whole city, if you try to meddle. I suggest setting up routine patrols!","267103":"Then the fires begin. It is their warning. You must find these masks who walk with the devil!","267104":"The scars the fire leaves behind do not heal fast.","267105":"We need a dedicated team to police the arsonists.","267106":"I don't think your sister likes me. But I have to keep fighting for what I believe in.","267107":"With your patrols, we can catch the arsonists in the act.","267108":"Catch the Pyrphorian arsonists!","267109":"It is these arsonists’ turn to be afraid!","267110":"The Pyrphorians work the weak to collapse. La Isla is their only hope of recovery.","267111":"Have sympathy for the many who are sick. Exhausted from the mines and the oil pumps.","267112":"There are many who struggle even to walk, cruelly made to work.","267113":"This is becoming a crisis. I worry the sick will die if we do not give them beds and clean linen.","267114":"Their homes were taken from them. Help them dream again.","267115":"First La Corona, now the Pyrphorians. If we come through this with our lives, we'll be lucky.","267116":"Take the sick and the weak from Prosperity to La Isla. Save them from a life of exploitation.","267117":"I cannot watch my people struggling under the Pyrphorian yoke.","267118":"We cannot rely on the old guard, they have given so much of their lives already.","267119":"This shall be the moment our movement truly begins! New ideas, new energy!","267120":"The young ones dream of something better. Better homes and a better life.","267121":"Without somewhere to call home, it is over for them.","267122":"These refugees, they have nowhere else to go.","267123":"You have to learn to make what friends you can out here.","267124":"I hate knowing the Empire or La Corona could just come here and crush us.","267125":"I'm sure your Queen wants to go charging in like a bull in a china shop. But good people still live on Prosperity.","267126":"I don't plan to leave anyone behind.","267127":"Keep the people moving. Now is not the time to stop and think.","267128":"All of us sticking together. That is the best chance we have of defending ourselves.","267129":"Even a modest fleet would give us independence.","267130":"It is not on land, but on water where we are vulnerable.","267131":"Wow this ship is so beautiful!","267132":"We shall name her after my brother, and pin a lock of his hair to the mast.","267133":"Pyrphorian ships approach. I have never dealt with them face-to-face. What can they want?","267134":"It is started—there's no going back. The Pyrphorians never give up.","267135":"Everything we produce here, the Pyrphorians take.","267136":"After the Pyrphorians come for the tithe, there is nothing left for us.","267137":"The cat is out of the bag. Now they know you are involved.","267138":"The Pyrphorian attack frightens them. Please, there must be room!","267139":"My island too must be evacuated, it is no longer safe there.","267140":"Many of my best were kidnapped. We have no hope of surviving without them.","267141":"What if these people grow sick? They're going to need a hospital!","267142":"Liar! You are the picture of regret!","267143":"You don't understand pain. Real pain.","267144":"But another tiresome prophet of doom, Archie. How dreary!","267145":"Well, momentarily, at least! Mr. Edvard Goode, you are to be placed under house arrest in Bright Sands until the time of your trial.","267147":"After the picket protests, many fine men left Bright Sands to join you.","267148":"Then Edvard struck back! He imprisoned all who were close to your father, including my beloved Thomas.","267149":"My husband and the others were deported to Wormways Prison and I've heard nothing from him ever since. If you do find him unharmed, prithee tell him his wife yearns for his return.","267150":"We're nearing the place your father died. Whatever happens, stay calm!","267151":"We didn't come here to be insulted, we came to strike a bargain. The demolitions man Thomas, we want him.","267152":"So there you are, the traitor's children!","267153":"Oh spare me the nauseating drivel! Flogging Queenie's peachy island in the New World to some rebel upstarts?! Traitor is too generous a word!","267154":"He hung himself in one of my cells. I'd call that a rather conclusive admission of guilt.","267155":"Oh I vaguely remember him. Stubborn, with a loose mouth, just as innocent as all the others.","267156":"He is small fry, a bail has been set.","267157":"Pay every penny of his money and I will place him immediately at your disposal.","267158":"How dare you...","267159":"Father would never have! He was the Queen's stalwart, a member of the Royal Council, he...","267178":"Burn. Burn!","267183":"When a limb is severed, a new one grows.","267184":"This kingdom shall fall with the dawn's first rays!","267185":"Drones build the nest. The Queen shall come.","267186":"It takes just a spark!","267187":"We are many.","267188":"The head of the Empire must come off.","267189":"Primal fire burns eternal!","267190":"You have no influence here!","267191":"Interfere with our thralls at your peril!","267192":"You are in dangerous waters!","267193":"These penitents work for us!","267194":"We only kept them alive to do our bidding.","267195":"The thralls will serve our master.","267196":"Isabel and her allies have trangressed for the last time! Die well!","267197":"Now we must inflict what we might have saved for later.","267198":"Isabel has forgotten what we do to those who disobey.","267199":"Fire prolongs the agony of death!","267200":"I reach out to all ship's captains, adventurers, luminaries, and merchant traders the length and breadth of the Empire! Heed my call! The life of many a good sailor is on the line.","267201":"It has been three years since the Arctic Council sent its two best ships in search of the legendary north-west passage, led by my dear husband, Sir John Faithful.","267202":"We've not heard from them since. The Arctic Council are sending rescue parties north, but their fleet is too thin to cover that vast territory before the arctic winter kicks in.","267203":"Are you decent and courageous enough to join this sole woman's cause? Worry not! Your combined efforts will be generously recompensed!","267204":"You can count on that, heheh! The noble old dame belongs to one of the most prosperous families there is.","267205":"Most likely all those poor mugs indulging her husband are drowned or chewing on their own bones, but like I said, where that much lucre's rolling in, I'll never be far behind! How's about you?","267206":"I can't believe you left me to look after shop.","267211":"This is not what I was born to do.","267212":"Our bond is being seriously tested. What are all these papers?","267213":"Admit it, you've forgotten about me.","267214":"How did Hannah do this all these years? I'm beginning to feel her pain.","267215":"I've got people asking me which palette of what needs to go where!","267216":"What are you up to overseas?","267221":"I bring grave news from our ice pilots. The pack ice becomes too thick. We'd be risking our ships if we were to continue our rescue.","267222":"So with a heavy heart, I have ordered the Arctic council fleet to return southwards to our winter haven. But do not lose hope! We will gather ourselves and return next year.","267223":"Can it be, the Arctic Council retreating just as we arrive? I mean the chairman is nonetheless correct, the pack ice grows stronger every day. Still, I have no intention of giving up as they have done.","267224":"I have assembled many of the finest-known craftsmen and ship-builders at our outpost. Presently they are preparing the shipyards to house our impressive icebreakers—vessels that will help carve a way through this frozen world.","267225":"I know it is a lot to ask, but will you endure and help me to create the fleet we need?","267226":"Yeah, go on and help the old dame send even more ships to be lost in the nothingness. Looks like you finally found your captain Ahab.","267227":"Meanwhile, I will set up me own little camp nearby. Just in case you need anything, Ishmael!","267229":"When will you give up pursuing the past and look to your future as my charge?","267230":"Gallivanting off again? People will call you irresponsible!","267231":"Sir Archibald sent you, did he?","267232":"You worked so hard to defy me! Then you run away again!","267233":"Have you met with any difficulty out there?","267234":"I promise not to ask any more of you, if you were to spend more time here.","267235":"I had the strangest dream last evening. I saw my John floating above his quarterdeck. He was waving and shouting but could not make himself heard. The silence prevailed as I approached him, when a giant wolf appeared between us.","267236":"And have we gone too far also, my friend?","267237":"Then let us be swift and brave. If only I knew what awaited us upon this eternal expanse.","267238":"You know not with whom you meddle. Leave, if you value your life, else all shall burn.","267239":"You saw Amarok. He preys upon those that stray too far from the path.","267240":"I cannot say. The spirits become restless when strangers enter their realm. If we stay too long, they will never let us leave.","267241":"So you're off to the icy marrow with the old dame, brrr. Don't get lost will yer, guv? You're me best customer!","267242":"I'm no more experienced in espionage than you, eldest. But this is our one chance to uncover the truth.","267263":"All those ships transmuting into ghosts. And then... silence.","267264":"We have to make this count. That contract will reveal all.","267265":"You have it! I never knew you had the ingenuity!","267266":"It is father's signature, but in Edvard's hand! Edvard was behind this!","267267":"I believe Sir Archibald when he says Her Majesty may do something drastic.","267268":"Well done Eldest! You have served both Isabel and the Empire greatly.","267269":"If this is the only way to get to the truth, then we must follow it.","267270":"I know it's only paperwork, but the Pyrphorians cannot operate if The Empire owns Prosperity again.","267271":"Isabel was true to her word in the end. You have to admire her shrewdness.","267272":"I realise Isabel means well.","267273":"If Aarhant were here, I'm sure he'd have some good advice.","267274":"To forge father's signature! Edvard must have been possessed!","267275":"I would have been right to strike Edvard's cheek, the many times I had the inclination!","267276":"I will not rest until Edvard sees justice, even if I must escort him to the gallows myself!","267277":"As Edvard is paraded to the town square, I want to be there in the front row.","267278":"Finally all those sailors may rejoice with their loved ones. I know what you are thinking. But don't worry. I feel no bitterness.","267280":"I know the rest are alive out there, and Sir John's broad shoulders shelter them from wind and snow.","267281":"All the stories being shared about my husband give me the strength to return next summer, with an even bigger fleet. Can I count on you again then? I dare hope so, my friend! I dare hope.","267282":"Let's not beat around the bush! We found nothing but endless white, not a single soul saved.","267283":"And yet I know that my husband and his men are out there somewhere. Frozen cold, but alive! Still alive.","267284":"I will fund another rescue attempt, come back next year, better prepared, with more ships and allies with even greater determination. Will you sail beside me again then? I dare to hope, my friend. I dare to hope!","267285":"My people's future is secure. They have you to thank for this.","267353":"The contract… it is gone! The Pyrphorians must have stolen it during the attack. How did I fall for such a simple diversion!?","267354":"You are going to have to inflitrate the Pyrphorians if you want to find that contract. I'm sorry.","267355":"You beat the Pyrphorians at their own game!","267356":"If you can convince the Queen to listen, we can explain to her.","267357":"I would give you that stupid island, if only I had the contract to tear to pieces.","267358":"We cannot thank you enough for preventing this war.","267359":"With that contract, we are taking the Pyrphorians down from the inside.","267360":"Prosperity is yours, take it! We have a new home now.","267361":"Near Prosperity, the Pyrphorians would kill us on sight.","267362":"At first I thought you were a spy of the Queen. Now I know your heart is in the right place.","267363":"I can tell you where the contract is. After that it's down to you.","267364":"Stay hidden, and you will succeed.","267365":"The man I met was your Uncle? I thought he was a creep!","267366":"I am sorry you had to go through all this just to have justice.","267367":"Her Majesty will soon go to war with Isabel over Prosperity. Any other solution would be preferable.","267389":"You would be doing a great service for Queen and country.","267390":"With that document we can still reverse the original deal.","267391":"Then it was Edvard that sold Prosperity. I didn't want to believe it, but I had my suspicions.","267392":"Her Majesty is very quick on the trigger. We must some how avoid her coming to blows.","267393":"Her Majesty will soon arrive upon her charger, sword aloft.","267394":"You have averted war most delicately! Her Majesty may thank you, in time.","267395":"Good, but there's little time. Her Majesty has her campaign chart out on the table!","267396":"A whole nation is behind you, though they do not know it.","267397":"Our Empire is spread too thin to countenance another war at this time.","267398":"Now war has been averted, an alliance with Isabel might even be of mutual benefit…","267399":"With the Pyrphorian presence on Prosperity neutralised, the island can be freely returned to its rightful keeper.","267400":"The Pyrphorians will no doubt regroup elsewhere.","267401":"Isabel needn't be an enemy to us, now Prosperity is back in safe hands.","267435":"These rebels, whoever they are, will pay the penalty for challenging my sovereignty!","267449":"The time has come to take that territory back by force.","267450":"Funny, ending a war over a bit of paper!","267451":"I must admit, I am too fond of my sailors.","267452":"I understand this means the end of a rebellion on the island, very good.","267453":"So is it Isabel who is nice, or the Pyrphorians?","267454":"As long as we have Prosperity back, that business with your father can be forgotten.","267455":"So Edvard was the nasty one, and Samuel was the one with the dandruff?","267456":"Fancy forging a signature. People can be terrible, can't they?","267457":"I'm surprised that Isabel gave it back without a fight.","267458":"If you'd taken me with you, I could have helped!","267464":"I hear you ducked out of a war. Not for the first time, eh, old pal?","267465":"Now is no time for boldness, but caution.","267466":"Don't distract me, old pal. I'm getting better at accounting!","267467":"Edvard! I told you he was rotten as a fig.","267468":"Edvard is behind this? He's pathetic.","267469":"There's a space between revenge and forgiveness.","267470":"You don't know what it is you do.","267477":"That island was signed off in Samuel's name!","267478":"Do not speak to me.","267479":"Igne Natura Renovatur","267498":"In lumine tuo videbimus lumen","267499":"The earth must burn before it turns.","267500":"The wheels turn and nothing can stop them.","267501":"All must bow to the flames.","267502":"This is not over.","267503":"The fire will burn forever!","267504":"Edvard was the cause of all our grief! To see his face when he discovers we know!","267519":"We confront Edvard this instant! I have so very many words for him!","267520":"Cast iron will make it very difficult for him to sidle away!","267521":"I will indulge not one of the thousand apologies I presume he has ready.","267522":"We should do what we can to get the evidence in order. No need to engage with Edvard.","267523":"The Queen wants the trial to be an occasion. We better make sure we're ready.","267524":"The evidence at such a high-profile inquiry must be absolutely watertight.","267525":"Finally we can have our revenge on Edvard for all he has done.","267526":"Leave no stone unturned. Who knows if Edvard has kept back other nasty surprises for us.","267527":"Now we are ready for Her Majesty. All the eyes of the world will be upon us.","267528":"If the Queen wants to make a big song and dance of the trial, we better see to it.","267529":"The Queen's visit, not the trial, may be the greatest occasion of your people's lives.","267530":"I don't know what I would do without you, eldest.","267531":"Everything comes under scrutiny in the presence of royalty.","267532":"Edvard is as good as dead to me.","267533":"I will not look at him at the trial.","267534":"Concentrate on securing a verdict for Edvard!","267535":"You were out there in paradise, and I dragged you into all this. I'm sorry.","267536":"You are the one positive in all of this. No sister could have asked for more.","267537":"Is this business really nearly over, eldest? I don't feel any better for all we've dug up.","267538":"I should have seen through it. Saved father while I had the chance.","267539":"Your ill tidings come as no surprise to me. Edvard's face betrays the game is up.","267546":"I pity the man.","267547":"There will be punishment. But Edvard has suffered since the day Samuel died.","267548":"Whatever the punishment, the damage to Edvard is already done.","267549":"We must prepare for a reckoning. Edvard was never the true enemy.","267550":"It is the Pyrphorians behind all of this, we cannot neglect the threat they pose.","267551":"The trial is a distraction. The real danger we are yet to face.","267552":"It is a start. But the Pyphorians are many.","267553":"Do everything to make sure the Queen is safe, old pal.","267554":"It will be an honour to have the Queen here, but it is not without risk.","267555":"Good, but the Queen may still be vulnerable.","267556":"Stay attuned. This is the perfect time for our enemy to recover.","267557":"We have seen nothing of the Pyrphorians but their minions.","267558":"Whoever is behind the Pyrphorians will take this time to weigh their options.","267559":"We cannot let this business with Edvard divert us from the real threat.","267560":"Black clouds loom, my old friend. Be ready to raise your umbrella.","267561":"I feel uneasy, and it's not the trial.","267562":"Even if we cannot forgive Edvard, we have to learn to let it go.","267563":"I have met the jury. They are idiots!","267564":"The Queen certainly speaks her mind.","267565":"Forget me, my race is run. A true devil is loose. It must be vanquished.","267568":"My defeat can still be your victory.","267569":"I know you want a villain, but this plot goes far beyond my petty greed.","267570":"Then you have all I can give you. I pray that it will be enough.","267571":"I'm sure you wish it was I who died. Well, soon you may have your wish.","267572":"Prosperity was only the beginning. These people will destroy everything and everyone if they have to.","267573":"There is a great danger to the established order. I will give you any help I can.","267574":"My life may be forfeit, but I can still do a last bit of good.","267575":"I didn't know what I was getting into, and then it was too late.","267576":"My father never loved me all these long years, only Samuel.","267577":"I sold our family down the river, no use hiding that now.","267578":"I regret everything. I know what Hannah must think of me.","267579":"I will not play the martyr, but I am ready to sacrifice myself for you and your sister's happiness.","267580":"I have been selfish, but I am not one of them, I never was. You must believe me.","267581":"I did not know they would kill Samuel for it, I had no idea!","267582":"Of course I will be a witness. After all you've done for us.","267597":"With Prosperity off our hands, the Pyrphorians will leave us alone.","267598":"Let me help you. I know I can make a difference.","267599":"I will tell them everything I know.","267600":"I don't need to take an oath to speak the truth.","267601":"I hope as witness, I can prove the Pyrphorians were behind this deal, not us.","267602":"I was certain it was your father that day, but now I know was wrong.","267603":"Your majesty. Isabel Sarmento, at your service.","267605":"I think it's better you break the bad news to Edvard. Let him know his gambit is over.","267619":"A terrible business. Edvard must be put now to trial.","267620":"It has been decided that you shall construct a new Court of Justice for the purpose of Edvard's trial.","267621":"As saviour in the New World, Her Majesty agrees that you should host this prestigious trial.","267622":"It is fitting that a new crown court be erected upon family soil for the trial.","267623":"Just like your court of justice, the case against Edvard is beginning to gather momentum.","267624":"Her Majesty has been ever so much looking forward to seeing her new Court of Justice. I hope you'll be ready.","267625":"Her Majesty is itching to visit! Have your best curtsey ready!","267626":"I hardly dare interrupt the miraculous transformation of your island, but Her Majesty is rather keen to get on with things.","267627":"This could be a good opportunity for Isabel Sarmento to come forward as a witness.","267628":"I think we have built up enough trust with Isabel to rely on her as a witness.","267629":"Her majesty was remarkably tolerant of the idea of Sarmento as a witness.","267630":"When it comes to the Pyrphorians, there's still a lot we don't know.","267631":"The Queen has taken a great interest in this trial.","267632":"Once built, your Court of Justice shall inaugurate a new era of peace and prosperity for Empire.","267642":"This trial should be a celebration! A toast to all things civilised.","267643":"I don't normally attend trials so this one must be important.","267644":"You now own the highest court in the land!","267645":"The Court of Justice, magnificent!","267646":"Is the Court of Justice finished yet? Not quite?","267647":"I can't wait to play judge and give the gavel a sharp tap!","267648":"Did Archie tell you I planned to visit? I hope there's a convenient mooring for my flagship. I don't like long walks.","267649":"Treat me as you would any other guest.","267650":"Just so you know, I am not fond of garlic or profiteroles.","267651":"One approves! And it is nice to get out and about.","267652":"It all sounds very cheery so far. Make it cheerier.","267653":"Mind you, I do like it when things are special. You can do special?","267654":"May I express my gratitude for your sterling work preserving peace on the continent.","267655":"So this is the funny little island that's hosting the trial! Jolly good.","267656":"Now I'm here, I am of course impatient for the trial to begin.","267657":"A modern Queen must show she is able to dispense mercy. The man must be given fair hearing.","267658":"Where are all the witnesses?","267659":"Now we are finally all present, let this long overdue trial commence!","267660":"And where's the defendant?","267661":"I lick my lips at the prospect of another Goode family tribunal.","267666":"People who disappoint the monarch often end up with me.","267667":"And the Queen is going to be there. What a treat.","267668":"Don't think you will get all the plaudits. Crime is my bag.","267669":"Your sister is very keen to see justice done. I will use all the tools at my disposal to ensure that is the case.","267670":"The problem with public inquiries is everything's out in the open.","267671":"Imagine serving twenty years in the system, and never getting a sniff of a trial like this.","267672":"Obviously you'll need my official authorisation of transfer if you want your prisoner brought to the dock!","267673":"Everything relating to the prison and its prisoners has to go through me!","267674":"You cannot allow Bright Sands to be subjugated! Our childhood home!","267695":"Bright Sands! You must save them!","267696":"Uncle Edvard… He’s suffered enough, eldest. I believe I can forgive him now.","267697":"Now we are all that remains, eldest. I intend to take strength from that.","267698":"We will not give in to terror! Never!","267699":"We must avenge Edvard—the only way we can, father.","267700":"Come what may, I am not afraid.","267701":"There is only one way left, eldest.","267702":"What you did goes far beyond us, dear blood. You have saved us all from a reign of terror.","267703":"It shall be a proper funeral. Let us reunite the two brothers, side-by-side. Once and for all, confine the past to the past.","267704":"We must bury them both together in the family tomb.","267705":"Let us talk once Samuel and Edvard have taken their rightful place side by side.","267706":"I do not feel any more sadness, eldest. The clouds have lifted—azure skies lie beyond.","267707":"Have joy in your heart as you make these final arrangements.","267708":"They will not have Bright Sands!","267709":"Another glimmer! Isabel fights beside us.","267710":"They will not stop you, eldest. Lead us forth!","267711":"Fires rage everywhere! We must unmask these arsonists before its too late!","267712":"The arsonists must be intercepted!","267713":"Now the fires are out of control, and the arsonists still loose!","267714":"Quickly, the civilians! I won't see them swept up in the fighting!","267715":"Bright Sands is no place for civilians! We must come to their rescue!","267716":"Find a way to extract them unnoticed!","267717":"Poor, poor Edvard!","267718":"Edvard was ready to make peace with himself at the end.","267719":"Father always wanted you to have Bright Sands. The past cannot hold you any more.","267720":"Edvard died far better than he lived. He is forgiven.","267721":"If father had but held Edvard—shown his affection.","267722":"When I come here, I bring only cattails—for peace and prosperity.","267723":"These stones are not cold, but warm. The sun is shining again.","267724":"The past may be buried but it is not forgotten.","267725":"There will be nothing left of the city if the arsonists remain on the prowl!","267727":"The Pyrphorians have seized Bright Sands. They enchain it to their foul cause!","267747":"The sky above Bright Sands glow with maleficence!","267748":"It is time, old pal. Our nemesis approaches!","267749":"It is time we stamped out this fire for good.","267750":"When they see how bright you burn, old pal, they will shrivel.","267751":"The first of many victories!","267752":"You have my blade. I am ready.","267753":"Old friend, it's over! The last Pyrphorians are sunk!","267754":"Before all this began, I owed you a debt. I may have paid it now, but I've made up my mind to stay, help you grow, at least a little longer.","267755":"We fight with you, no matter what.","267763":"We can help you, just give us the sign.","267764":"Exploit their supply lines! Small operations can have big rewards!","267765":"Sabotage their supply lines! They rely on them as much as we do.","267766":"There is no dent in their supply! We missed an opportunity!","267767":"Ha, you did it! Without their precious fire they are nothing!","267768":"You broke the chain! Now we are really somewhere.","267769":"I never thought I would take the Empire's side!","267770":"The Queen has promised to recognise our independence.","267771":"I like Sir Archibald, he is a funny man.","267772":"This is all rather unusual. We are safe here?","267792":"This is unexpected. You are taking care of those beastly malefactors, aren't you?","267793":"A few angry hoodlums can't overthrow an Empire, can they?","267794":"I thought they must be after fame or riches, but they want to kill me.","267795":"I wonder what has become of the royal fleet…","267796":"Tell me they are not attacking this island? The one we are on?","267797":"I surrender myself wholly to your security arrangements.","267798":"I suppose then, my safety is in your hands.","267799":"Another player has had their island seized!","267800":"When we get out of this I promise you a whole duchy. Although, no, I can't actually promise that.","267801":"We are so happy to be finally allowed to leave this island. And for your heroism of course.","267802":"Under different circumstances, you might have called it a pleasant visit!","267803":"I'm sure we can make Isabel's tiny little chunk a protectorate of some sort.","267804":"A rival might take over your island!","267805":"The Pyrphorians must fall or civilisation will!","267819":"Under no circumstances must the Queen's safety be compromised!","267820":"You have won the day!","267821":"How shall I explain to her majesty that we are under siege…","267822":"This must be the Pyrphorian mothership!","267823":"My giddy aunt, that is no normal naval craft!","267824":"Without supplies, I'm not absolutely sure we can hold out…","267825":"The Queen must be saved at all costs!","267826":"Those supplies could be crucial in gaining the upper hand over our foes.","267827":"Reinforcements are coming! Our royal supply ships must pass unscathed!","267828":"We cannot afford to lose many more ships to our foe.","267829":"Perhaps this will bring their ringleader out of the woodwork.","267830":"Such reinforcements are going to be vital.","267831":"The Queen is saved! All thanks to your remarkable travails and hardships!","267832":"The battle for Bright Sands will decide the fate of civilisation!","267833":"The ever-increasing roar from the street will need a ruler as capable and wise as Her Majesty.","267835":"First Samuel, now Edvard! Soon I will be rid of your dreary family once and for all.","267848":"Goode & Sons. Favourites of the Royal Council. How I've enjoyed watching your family's slow and ignoble demise.","267849":"What a fool Edvard was to trust us!","267850":"Behold my solar barque!","267851":"Chivalry died with the monarchy!

Of course, as soon as he and his soldiers have disembarked, the crew of your ship collapse about in grievous relief.","800208":"<b>'Save your breath, windbag,'</b> says the Inspector, with an air of a man accustomed to weaselling. 'Show me the damn ship, or I shall become vexed!'","800209":"<b>'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'</b> the Inspector sneers, pointing to three unlucky sailors. 'Hang them,' he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.","800210":"<b>'You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,'</b> the Inspector sneers, and points at your specialist. 'Hang this traitor,' he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.","800227":"Of Unsound Mind","800228":"<b>The man spasms, eyes rolling, before finally falling unconscious.</b> His mania had come suddenly, with eight men needed to pacify, and bind him to the mast. Some say he is possessed by daemons and must be done rid of. The officers, less credulous, seek a surer explanation. The only way to silence a worsening quarrel, is to find a solution.","800229":"Enlist the aid of the hypnotist","800230":"Examine the cause of this wildness in him","800231":"Try to calm the crew, and pray the man recovers","800232":"Guard him round the clock in his cabin","800233":"Ignore the officers and get rid of him before it's too late","800234":"<b>The crew are delighted the man has returned to his normal self.</b> The hypnotist used a pendulum to induce him into deep sleep, before imparting subliminally, some choice words. Within days the fellow is happily back at work. All are buoyant that such a severe case was so artfully cured!","800235":"<b>It is a superb recovery in the circumstances.</b> The examination uncovers a bluish contusion under the hair. 'We are to act swiftly or he shall die!' says the doctor, as he bores a drill into the man's cranium. Once the blood is drained, the resultant hole is covered with a silver coin, and the head beswaddled with bandages. The man is fully recovered within a few days, and the crew greatly impressed by the actions of the doctor.","800236":"<b>The whole examination takes too long,</b> 'though a bluish contusion is found under the hair. 'I must act or he shall soon die!' gulps the doctor, but then proceeds to faff nervously through a medicine bag, until the poor man dies on the operating table. 'You did the best you could,' a colleague offers, but there is a hollowness to it.","800237":"<b>The patient grabs the doctor's head and smashes it against the table.</b> The doctor was tapping his knee to check reflex, when the devil cut loose. 'He wants putting out of his misery,' a sailor cries, once the man is wrestled to the deck again. So they cut his throat. Attention turns to the doctor, but he is a doctor no more. Injury has rendered him insensible; an eight-year-old boy trapped in the body of a man!","800238":"<b>Hellish horror ensues,</b> as the doctor insists on checking if 'ought is stuck in the throat'. As he prises open the lion's jaws, the daemon creature lurches up into his throat. So frenzied is this vampiric assault, that there is little the crew can do but to raise their pistols to the gruesomeness. When the gunsmoke clears, doctor and patient lie dead, entwined and contorted beneath a bloody dew.","800239":"<b>The crew are convinced</b> by the chaplain that god has a plan for this man. They agree to bind him to his bed while the chaplain prays for his fast recovery. After two weeks he still suffers gaps in his memory, and a paralysis of the face, but   thanks are given to the lord above that he is otherwise his usual self.","800240":"<b>The sailors are partially convinced</b> there is a spiritual explanation for his deranged behaviour, but insist on chaining him to his bed. 'He must have done something terrible in the eyes of God,' they say. Despite all hope for his fast recovery, he dies not two days later, his malady forever a mystery.","800241":"<b>The faithless crew will not trust this to God,</b> but can neither agree if the possessed man should be thrown to sea, as desired by the sailors, or permitted a chance to see out his ordeal, as demanded by the officers.","800242":"Side with the officers and warn the sailors to cooperate or suffer the consequences","800243":"Convince the officers the needs of the many must prevail over the needs of the few","800244":"<b>The sailors would not dare mutiny,</b> of course, and return to their stations. At first they fear the bed-ridden man will commit some terrible act while they sleep. But they need not have worried, since he dies of the unexplained malady not two days later.","800245":"<b>The sailors are outraged</b> and their response is immediate. In greater numbers they overwhelm and restrain the officers, while the sickly subject of their fury is bound and thrown into the deep. Confidence in the leadership of the expedition is undermined and the possibility of further trouble seems never far away.","800246":"<b>No officer can deny the logic of the argument,</b> yet, when the man is bound and thrown overboard they cannot help but show their grief it is for no fault of his own, and that none had knowledge with which to better help him.","800247":"<b>'It's a bally disgrace! You dishonour a gentleman!'</b> say the officers, as the man is bound and thrown overboard, 'such incompetence shall be reported to the highest authority!' Not only is a man lost, but the expedition brought into disrepute.","800248":"<b>There was little for the guards to report,</b> but occasionally 'quelling the mad dog' with liquor. After a fortnight, the poor man recovers with no recollection of anything, and while his hand is partially paralysed, he is still able to perform his usual duties.","800249":"<b>The damn guards are found with sacks over their heads.</b> They swear they did not see their attacker, but weakly-tied hands suggest collusion. Of course the patient's bed is vacant, and he seems to be missing, permanently. After that, rumours circulate, and no-one seems to have any trust in anyone else.","800250":"<b>The officers react with disgust to your decision to toss him overboard,</b> and state in no uncertain terms that the whole matter will be reported. But the sailors are quite obviously relieved that his demonic presence has been exorcised.","800254":"<b>After weeks of hot weather, supplies of drinking water have become dangerously low.</b> It therefore seems a minor miracle when a fellow ship appears on the horizon, for surely they have water to share? But as it draws near, the crew is aghast, for there is no sign of life aboard. 'It is a ghost ship, we must flee before it is too late!' they cry.","800255":"Send a diver to check it out","800256":"Heathen superstition! Board the ship!","800257":"Leave and hope to find an island with drinking water soon","800258":"<b>The diver does remarkably</b> to spot the fiends furled in sails, or waiting under barrels to ambush, should your men have boarded. Your ship draws alongside the vessel as if to pass, but then unleashes enough cannon-fire to drown it. The crew are elated, believing they have done the oceans a great service.","800259":"<b>Heavens shine upon you,</b> for whatever caused the crew to vacate this ship seems no longer a concern. Better yet, the lord has seen fit to provide the water you seek.","800260":"<b>The ship's hold contains an unholy mound</b> of corpses. 'God hath forsaken these men', says the doctor, 'but how?'","800261":"<b>The crew are so faithless,</b> that every creaking plank aboard the ghostly ship raises a whimper. So when a banshee howl erupts from below deck, every sailor runs for their life. One poor soul trips in a coil of rigging and cracks their head upon an iron capstan. The death exposes all the more the crew's foolishness.","800262":"Have the doctor investigate what happened","800263":"Leave the ship immediately","800264":"<b>'We are lucky indeed,</b> for malaria cannot reach us now.' says the doctor confidently. This swift diagnosis confirms the crew are pleased to load up the drinking water they have been gasping for.","800265":"<b>'Touch nothing! Get off the ship,'</b> frets the doctor, who believes a dreadful plague has taken the crew of this ill-fated vessel. Perhaps drinking water is itself the cause. The crew are miserable time has been wasted, and that their thirst is still not slaked.","800266":"<b>The doctor is inconsolable,</b> 'it is plague. I lanced a bubo, and it ruptured suddenly upon my person!' That the water be contaminated is misery enough, but to have to abandon the good doctor is a disaster! Your expedition drifts glumly on.","800267":"<b>No relief at escaping the grotesque mound of corpses,</b> can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'","800268":"<b>No relief at escaping the disturbingly empty ship,</b> can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if 'gift horses always be looked in the mouth.'","800269":"<b>Terrifyingly, the ship takes after yours in pursuit.</b> Who knows what dread hands operate its multifarious controls!","800270":"Try to outrun the awful vessel!","800271":"Turn and face it, whatever it is!","800272":"<b>Your ship manages to escape</b> the ghoulish clutches of that unwholesome adversary, but have no drinking water, or anything else, to show for the ordeal.","800273":"<b>Your ship is not agile enough.</b> Men pour into the waves from where enemy cannons punch holes. Seemingly contented with this sacrifice, the dread sentience commanding the vessel calls off its dreadful pursuit.","800274":"<b>Pirates! But trickery cannot match the power of a modern seaship!</b> Summarily demolished, a few of them are left clinging to wreckage. They beg to join your cause - unpaid. Such are the dwindling prospects of piracy in this day! The crew will jibe at them, but secretly all must be elated to have acquired such sea-wisdom for free.","800275":"<b>A pirate nuisance!</b> Though their scurvy deception gives them advantage, they are like many of their creed, rather jaded. By the time their ship is sunk, it has cost you a few good men. Yet the recovery of precious drinking water in among the flotsam, assuages the grief of your crew.","800276":"<b>Bloody pirates! A terrible menace even in this day and age!</b> Your crew are outmanoeuvred, outsmarted, and your ship is reeled-in for boarding. Many are killed in valiant defence of the company, but to no avail. Your vessel is duly ransacked for supplies, before the villains are again on their way.","800277":"The Ghost Ship","800279":"The Predator","800280":"<b>'A fearsome predator stalks us!'</b> the cabin-boy whispers. Perhaps he is right, for this resupply has not been as uneventful as hoped. Only the first evening moored in this bay, and a man goes missing - tracks up the beach into jungle. Many wonder how work can be expected to continue...","800281":"Bait the creature","800282":"Send hunters to track it","800283":"Speak with locals","800284":"Lay a trap","800285":"Leave the island","800286":"<b>With the perfect lure</b> placed enticingly in the crook of a tree, there is an inevitability about a capture. Sure enough, yellow eyes pierce the darkness, and a mighty beast pads softly over to the bait. A net is hurriedly cast about it and secured, thus leaving the expedition free to resupply unthreatened.","800287":"<b>Your huntmasters are expert,</b> and trace with great care, the soft hollows imprinted by feline paw. Led to a clearing, they correctly judge this to be a lair, where they stand ready with a net. When the cat returns, heaving hot breath, the hunters pounce. With net secure, the expedition is free to resupply unthreatened.","800288":"<b>At least one hunter did the right thing,</b> and kept his eyes open while they traced the beast's pawprints. Another was not so wise, and was heard to let out a scream. His comrades were drawn to the spot, and struck the majestic beast down. But not before the damage was done.","800289":"<b>Three days pass, and still no word.</b> There is a common feeling something must be done to save those men.","800290":"Send a rescue party","800291":"Wait a bit longer","800292":"Leave the island without them","800293":"<b>It is only something of a relief</b> when the rescue party return. It's bad news... the hunters are dead. The rescue party described the bright and long-maned beast, and how in a tussle, they slayed it. With the bodies of the hunters buried, the expedition is able to resupply in an atmosphere of respectful silence.","800294":"<b>'Horror! It's picking us off one by one!'</b> bawls a fearful sailor, for now the rescue party too, have failed to return. There is nothing for the disconsolate remainder of the crew to do, but leave this sorry place behind.","800295":"<b>Doubtful prayer brings no news</b> of the lost hunters. The men have nowhere to look for guidance, and there is a burdensome feeling that a decision must be made.","800296":"<b>Conviction in the lord is of little use here,</b> it seems. Two days later a hunter, whose leg is mangled, limps back into view. After the necessary amputation, he is heard to groan that the others perished. All must leave this savage place.","800297":"<b>'We leave them for dead,</b> when they could be right there now waiting for us!' cries a furious old tar. Like so many others, he is disgusted that good men should give their lives for nothing but impatience!","800298":"<b>'Absurd magic, but it works!'</b> say officers sent to the inland village for help. Having described the beast, they were referred to a witch. She encouraged them to ingest live scorpions, one of each colour; yellow, red and black. This they did reluctantly, but found when they confronted the animal, it took flight. All promptly follow the witch's advice, and sure enough, remain undisturbed for the remainder of the resupply.","800299":"<b>'Our plight means nothing to the locals,'</b> bemoan the officers sent as diplomats. 'Telling them beasts stalk the jungle, is as like alerting a hatter to the presence of hats on his hatstands.'","800300":"<b>'Their deity is desecrated!'</b> urges the officer sent as diplomat. All around the bay, daubed faces appear, bows raised to the expedition camp.","800301":"Teach them a lesson","800302":"Run for the ship!","800303":"<b>'A hollow victory',</b> say the men. For the locals lie dead, but the jungle beast stalks on.","800304":"<b>Odds against them, the men fight as best they can.</b> Fought back onto the sand, they deflect the rain of arrows with whatever they can lay hands on. A relay is able to return precious equipment to the ship and set sail, but not without a number of casualties, of whom some do not make it.","800305":"<b>The onslaught is deadly.</b> Few among your crew have the requisite experience to defend themselves, and so the sand reddens with their blood. Of those who make it as far as the expedition ship, a number succumb to the poison-tip arrows. It is a massacre.","800306":"<b>'Run!' comes the panicked cry.</b> The men drop their work, and tramp desperately through the shallows to the ship. A volley of arrows pierces three, squirting crimson into the clear blue. 'Dead aside, we have lost a great deal more in provisions than we have gained,' laments the quartermaster, as your ship departs that wretched bay.","800307":"<b>The ingenious powers</b> of the craftsmen among your crew have fashioned a pitfall for the beast. There is not long to wait before there is a tinkle on the handbell, and all can gather above the trap to see the monster growling at its bottom. The resupply may now happily proceed, knowing that danger is averted.","800308":"<b>The beast is too intelligent</b> to fall for makeshift traps. It is clearly evading the pitfall prepared by those supposed to be the expedition's deftest craftsmen. 'Little more we can do,' they shrug.","800309":"<b>'It's a considerable setback,'</b> say senior officers. Fresh water, wood for burning, plants for medicine - it does no good to list what myriad opportunities are missed in bypassing the bay. And all for the sake of fears over one measly wild animal.","800312":"Opera House in the Jungle","800313":"<b>'It's too narrow and shallow this far upriver!'</b> warns the steersman. Escorting Mr. Cardinale to the site of his rainforest opera house now seems all the more preposterous! The great patron of the arts twizzles his moustache in frustration! Apart from braving the difficulty ahead, only traversing a nearby hill might reconnect the expedition with the upper river.","800314":"Use your gunboat to navigate the shallows","800315":"Have the ship transported over the hill to rejoin the river further up","800316":"Attempt to carefully navigate the narrow passage","800317":"Decline to proceed any further and return to sea","800318":"<b>The design of the gunboat is vital to your success.</b> Being of moderate size, and yet possessing the manoeuvring capabilities of a much smaller ship, the gunboat is able to navigate the awkward river shallows with ease. Mr. Cardinale is delighted that you have delivered him to the site of his proposed Opera House, and promises to talk favourably of each and every man when he returns to civilisation.","800319":"<b>'What a champion performance!' squeals Mr. Cardinale,</b> from the comfort of his cushioned chair. The great ship seems to swim up and over the hill. The long timbers on which it rolls, and corkscrew winches at intervals up the slope work perfectly. 'I shall put in a good word for you all at the club,' promises Cardinale, as the ship splashes down safely on the other side. The men are immensely proud of the miracle they have performed.","800320":"<b>Getting a ship over a hill is mad, but it works.</b> 'Is this absolutely necessary?' muses Mr. Cardinale having watched the crew slip for a week in mud. But the rolling timbers and makeshift winches they have crafted prove adequate, and the ship finally scrapes down the other side, into the upper river. Mr. Cardinale barely offers a word of thanks, perturbed perhaps, by the indignity of it all.","800321":"<b>There simply aren't enough materials</b> to conduct such an elaborate enterprise. The crew think with a few extra bits and bobs, dragging the ship up the hill might be possible.","800322":"<b>'I think it's going to give way!' cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale.</b> The feet of your men slip and slide on the mudstrewn slope, as the great weight of the ship plummets it back down the hill. Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. A hideous accident caused by inadequate materials, that signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800323":"Proceed uphill without materials, belief will guide us through","800324":"Ask the locals gathered around the scene if they are able to help","800325":"<b>The men have the conviction</b> to safely hoist the ship up and over the hill. It is a fatiguing week, but belief in making the impossible possible possesses them. When the ship finally splashes into the water, Mr. Cardinale has barely a Christian word of thanks for the crew. It has taken a long enough after all.","800326":"<b>It is all going so well,</b> this mad idea, with winches and cables scarcely sufficient for the task. But exertion eventually tells. As the ship rocks over the crest of the hill, there is not enough to keep it there, and it hurtles wildly down the other side. It is lucky the ship is not swept away in the river current. Still, it sustains significant damage from impact with the trees.","800327":"<b>'I think it's going to give way!'</b> cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale. The feet of your men slip and slide on the slope, as the unholy weight of the ship overcomes the winches, and it plummets back down the hill. Men try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800328":"<b>The locals are willing to provide help and materials.</b> While it takes the crew time to incorporate the materials into their winch design, the locals are happy to wait. Good relations make the feat of hoisting a ship over a hill less painful than it might have been. The boat finally clatters down into the water of the upper river. All are most grateful to the locals, without whom none of this would have been possible.","800329":"<b>A few locals vaguely offer to help,</b> but their lukewarm efforts do little to relieve the exhausted crew. The ridiculous hill-climb takes more than a week. When the ship finally slips into the water over the other side, not even Mr. Cardinale has energy enough to care.","800330":"<b>The locals have absolutely no interest in helping you,</b> and fade into the trees. Beleaguered by shouts from Mr. Cardinale, the men meekly follow orders. The mad persistence has disastrous consequences. The ship plummets back down the hill! Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.","800331":"<b>Competent navigation</b> rescues your ship from the mother of all rivers. Mr. Cardinale is tremulous throughout, believing his dreams may beach like a river dolphin at any time. But over the course of three tricky days, information is relayed quickly enough between wheel and forecastle to avoid any harmful collisions. There is relief all around when the corner is made and the river broadens again.","800332":"<b>'Rapids?!' exhales Mr. Cardinale crossly.</b> Ahead white water churns. There is nothing for it but to push on. As the ship strains against the current, there are dreadful noises from rocks on the keel. The crew wince at each and every thump and screech. Finally, after a week, the river broadens again, and the crew can inspect the damage - it doesn't look good.","800333":"<b>It is a heart-breaking experience.</b> Days go by in the effort to lever the ship out of the sandy shallows, where it does not belong. It is battered by rocks and rapids, and leaks like a rusted bucket. Mr. Cardinale kicks up and awful fuss. Finally when it feels like progress is being made, the next bend reveals a harrowing sight - an insurmountable waterfall! Never have the crew felt more hopeless.","800334":"<b>Mr. Cardinale is incensed</b> that his grand plans for the rainforest Opera House have been thwarted. Some of the men find his blustering funny, but the officers are horrified that such an influential figure has been rebuffed, and are afraid to show their faces in society ever again.","800336":"The Minefield","800337":"<b>At the cry of 'mines!', all rush to the prow.</b> Sure enough, several of the conical terrors bob seductively below. 'Who knows how many of these infernal machines have passed us by, or yet await us. A false move, and this sea shall be a lake of fire! What the devil do we do?'","800338":"Use dynamite to start a chain reaction","800339":"<b>'The way ahead is clear as the eye can see!'</b> says the delighted officer, folding up his telescope. As the last motes of fire trail down into the waves and fizzle, the crew can but admire such brave use of dynamite. 'Better than fireworks!' says another, 'The men have never been so entertained!'","800340":"Try to navigate the minefield","800341":"<b>'We are masters of the sea!'</b> sing the triumphant crew, as the ship weaves easily beyond the last line of mines. 'Even Odysseus, when faced with Scylla and Charybdis, lost men. We have lost none of our company, and our bonds only strengthen!' Soon, a special bottle is being uncorked, and toasts raised to the continued success of the expedition!","800342":"<b>'What was that noise?' gulps the helmsman,</b> but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess.","800343":"<b>While at first plain sailing, the minefield is now gooey with danger.</b> A line of densely-packed mines stand between the ship and freedom. 'With some makeshift device, we can clear the path ahead,' explains the officer, 'I'm afraid to say, it is the only way we shall get out of this in one piece.'","800344":"<b>The awfulness has barely begun.</b> Restless waves conceal a thickening of the mines, and the ship's haphazard path makes impact inevitable. 'Brace!' scream port-side, just prior to a portion of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who have lost many good sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.","800348":"Build that device","800349":"<b>'She survived! It worked!' calls the lookout,</b> as makeshift grapples trailing behind the little dinghy are able to hook the mines aside. Relief only comes, of course, once the expedition ship is clear of this last line of mines. 'How did we get in such a pickle?' says one. 'At least we're out of it,' says another.","800350":"<b>A nervous sailor rows towards the line of mines.</b> The makeshift grappling hooks trailing behind his dinghy are intended to drag mines out of the path of the expedition ship. Unfortunately the sailor is a sacrificial goat. A grapple shatters the horns of a nearby mine, and the boat and its sailor explode in plume. Safe passage means nothing to those from whom a good friend was taken.","800351":"<b>The idea is a terrible one from the start.</b> The lengthy poles, comprised of other poles, are unwieldy and inaccurate, even in the hands of a several strong men. The crew's attempt to poke mines away when they draw near is suicide. Two booms come in succession, and a few feeble cheers at escape are drowned by the deafening wails. Few are left to bail water, when so many lie dead or injured.","800352":"Go through diplomatic papers in search of any clues","800353":"<b>The search is a fruitful one.</b> The well-organised diplomatic library includes a comprehensive folio of papers on nearby mine positions. This enables the navigators to chart a safe course through the waters. The very same paper remarks that the mines were moored during the war, in order to protect a now-disused outpost. You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.","800354":"<b>The search is worthwhile.</b> After a few hours scouring the diplomatic archives, a paper on nearby mine positions is found. This gives the navigators the difficult task of charting a safe course through the waters. No-one is quite sure if the information given is up-to-the-minute, but when the last line of mines is cleared, all are suitably relieved.","800355":"<b>The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.</b> A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.","800356":"<b>Optimism makes way for abject terror,</b> as the map of mines that is found and used for navigation turns out to be completely false. Terrible detonations devastate the ship's timbers, and countless lives are lost. 'Misinformation is worse than no information,' an officer laments, as his tears bleed the ink of the erroneous chart, which as it happens, refers to a different stretch of water.","800357":"Turn around and try to escape","800358":"<b>A few saintly volunteers approach,</b> offering to scout back the way you came and ease your escape. Asked if they aren't afraid of the cone-shaped mines, they reply 'The lord will see us through.'","800359":"Allow them to go ahead","800360":"Tell them to stay on the ship","800361":"<b>The volunteers exude calm,</b> as their lone dinghy traces a path much akin to that which got you into this mess. Although their silent vigil transports you to safety, all agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.","800362":"<b>While the path the volunteers cut is a true one,</b> it does not account for the difference in size between the two ships. It only takes a narrow graze to explode one of the mines, and though no lives are lost, the damage to your ship is significant. The crew are dismayed by the situation.","800363":"<b>For the godless dinghy, doom seems inevitable</b> the moment it drops and a man slops overboard. This inauspicious beginning foreshadows the disaster to follow. Prayers unheard, steering in the rough current proves impossible. The little boat is last seen careening towards the sinister cones it sought to avoid. 'The terrible loss of life shall remain with me all my days,' says a devastated officer.","800364":"<b>It is horrifying that most significant members of the crew</b> are aboard this fragile dinghy. Of course one would not wish a mine to explode any loyal man, but when it bellows up below a collection of your finest, death stings all the more. The crew are understandably devastated at the destruction they have witnessed first-hand. Life feels as if it may never be the same again.","800365":"<b>Your faith goes untried</b> in the nervous silence, as the ship escapes the mine trap the same way it entered. All agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.","800366":"<b>Your faith does not go untried.</b> The sinister cones have moved about over time, and no matter how truly the ship follows its original course, it is inevitable a mine will burst into the hull. Luckily when the blast comes, no man dies. Still, the burdensome schedule of repair disheartens the crew.","800367":"<b>None of it is of any use.</b> Your godforsaken crew do not realise how the sinister cones move about over time. No matter how true the course, more than one mine shakes the ship's belly as it limps clear. Many lives are lost, and the damage to the ship is severe.","800391":"Reward Event","800392":"You found some mysterious item","800396":"You found a tourist that offers to trade with you.","800441":"You have found a radiant relic! The crew toast the success of your archaeological expedition. May we now better understand what it is to be human!","800448":"You have captured a wild animal! The crew toast the success of your zoological expedition. This can only aid studies of the natural world!","800454":"You have earned a reward for your altruism! The crew toast a successful rescue, with all returning to the glad comforts of home.","800460":"You have discovered pirate bounty! With the dread buccaneers blown out of the water, a search of their sunken wreck unearths a well-deserved reward!","800467":"Love Island","800468":"<b>A matter of the heart.</b> The crew have been enjoying some island hospitality, but many are now refusing to leave. They have fallen in love with the sons and daughters of the local king. Perhaps he can be convinced to allow them to come with you? You can attempt to come to an arrangement, or else wait for him to consult his copper oracle.","800470":"Offer a wedding gift","800471":"Convince the king your crew's affection is genuine","800472":"Await the verdict of the copper oracle","800473":"Leave without the crew who've fallen in love","800474":"<b>The king is not only surprised,</b> but moved to tears by the romantic composers he hears via the gramophone. He insists on a grand banquet to celebrate the union of his children and your crew. Both traditional music and a few cranks of the new-fangled gramophone accompany the beautiful ceremony, and then its bon voyage!","800475":"<b>The king is delighted to see his children wed.</b> Delicate understanding of local custom and a smattering of their language allow a message of true love to be conveyed. The king evidently thinks his children in good hands. Feasting, and to the amusement of all, terrible dancing, follows. For his departing children, it shall be the longest, most fascinating honeymoon.","800476":"<b>Something is lost in translation.</b> Yet the king smiles benignly, as if your crew still have a chance to prove themselves. 'He suggests a great hunt,' says your diplomat, 'or else we may await arcane judgment.' His eyes flick to a copper oracle on a dais.","800477":"<b>The awkward gestures and diagrams in the sand</b> prove highly offensive to the king and his people. Sensing outrage, the crew back away towards the ship. The angry locals fire arrows at their former amours. Fittingly, one is struck in the heart, and bleeds out into the brine. The rest return lovelorn, to their dreary maps and compasses.","800478":"Capture the king a prize animal","800479":"Face the verdict of the copper oracle","800480":"<b>The hunt goes quite well.</b> Beautiful boars inhabit the woods, and though tricky to catch, are little trouble for your experts. Though the king will still not allow you to leave with his children, the feast of boar brings everyone together in the moment. The lovers understand this moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.","800481":"<b>The hunt is not perfect.</b> The crew show courage in pursuit of a tiger, which draws the king's admiration. Sadly, they cannot catch it, which leaves the king wondering if your men will be able to provide once married. Thus, he decides not to let his children leave. Some of your crew remain committed to staying behind, and it is with regret you must continue without them.","800482":"<b>Your naive hunters fail the test.</b> Forest deer are everywhere, and hunting them hardly seems a challenge. Had your so-named 'hunters' any respect for nature, they'd have realised the sacred deer were not what the king was after. Instead they gather them up greedily. The king makes it perfectly clear your expedition must move on. With heavy hearts, the sailors return to the ship.","800483":"<b>The oracle predicts a reassuring fate for all.</b> Those who wish to remain for love will live fulfilling lives, but the same shall be true for those still committed to your expedition. All parties feel a sense of peace. Your voyage shall continue without any resentment towards those it leaves behind.","800484":"<b>The copper oracle is disappointingly undecided.</b> The king cannot, in good faith, allow his children to leave to an uncertain destiny. His ultimatum is that your crew become part of his extensive family or else they must leave alone. Though understandable, it is nevertheless regrettable when some decide to stay behind.","800485":"<b>The copper oracle predicts that your souls cannot be saved.</b> With your crew rotten to the core, the king makes it clear there can be no union with his children, and that you are no longer welcome. Heart-broken and bearing the burden of sin, the crew return to the triviality of duty.","800486":"<b>The copper oracle sees only purity in your crew's hearts.</b> It predicts a bounteous future for the king's children, and so with tearful pride, he gives the couples his blessing. The traditional ceremony is both spiritually uplifting and wholesome.","800487":"<b>The copper oracle reveals a little doubt in your crew's hearts.</b> The king interprets that his children will only be happy if they remain on the island., and that some of your sailors are not in love, but merely infatuated. Still, you must lose the fine crew who have formed genuine bonds.","800488":"<b>The copper oracle reveals great doubt in your crew's hearts.</b> The king does not for a minute believe that your inconstant crew are as deep in love as they claim. If they cannot demonstrate otherwise, it might be better if your people left.","800489":"<b>The copper oracle proclaims your crew's hearts sinful and wicked.</b> Arm-in-arm with their new-found amours, the sailors await some happy answer. But the moment the king's arm is raised, daggers unsheathe, plunging into the hearts of the would-be lovers. Speechless and unharmed, the rest are free to leave the island, pondering the grave cost of faithlessness.","800490":"Try to convince the king your crew is worthy","800491":"Order the crew to leave at once","800492":"<b>Careful diplomacy has him thinking twice.</b> Perhaps there is a way for the crew to prove themselves. A lean champion steps forward. Fighting him may impress the king, or else you can try and outhunt him.","800493":"<b>The king is offended by your insolence.</b> Without a word he boards a boat and heads out to sea. Some foolishly follow, believing he can be reasoned with, but they have even less knowledge of local boats than local customs. Their bodies will be dredged from the reef as your tactless expedition struggles on.","800494":"Propose a contest of champions","800495":"Propose a hunting competition","800496":"<b>You have your champions.</b> One-by-one the suitors fight the king's champion. Those who prevail, it turns out, are permitted to take their lovers to sea. Some fail, but can at least drown their sorrows during the farewell celebration that follows.","800497":"<b>It is not a pleasant sight for the faint of heart.</b> Your best champion is put forward, and subsequently knocked about the head for the entirety of the contest. At the end a cloth is needed to conceal the disfigured face. The king expresses his condolences for your loss, but all is fair in love and war.","800498":"<b>It is close but the king's champion is outfoxed.</b> By sundown your best hunter has claimed six boars to their five. The king will still not allow you to leave with his children, but the feast of boar brings everyone together in one moment. The lovers understand a moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways.","800499":"<b>Lacking the skill, your hunters try to cheat.</b> Without knowledge of the island's fauna, they decide to follow the king's hunters in the hope of poaching the animal they are tracking. But they are led a merry dance. Three days pass, and your champion is missing presumed dead. The crew have no choice but to depart, tail between their legs.","800500":"<b>Paradise lost!</b> The expedition may be back underway, but the mood is abject as the beautiful island becomes but painful memory. Too painful for one, who is discovered dead, it is said, by way of a broken heart.","800501":"<b>It is a significant blow.</b> Any happiness the crew might feel at their comrades finding love is consumed by feelings of resentment. How could they have been so selfish? The expedition goes on, but those who are still a part must take on twice as much work.","800503":"The Singular Case of the Midshipman","800504":"<b>The Midshipman is found with his throat slit, knife in hand.</b> It would appear to be suicide, but appearances often prove deceptive. Understandably, the whole crew crowd the scene, debating whether he was the type to take his own life, or if someone might have gained by his passing. Needless to say, they expect some action be taken...","800506":"The Expert will have the answers","800507":"Commence an investigation","800508":"Do nothing, it's suicide - nothing more to be said","800509":"<b>There are gasps of macabre delight,</b> as the famous detective reveals the only possible solution. 'Elementary you see. Look at this tiny moth wing on the body. Moths are drawn to light, and the sole light this night past issued from... this man's LANTERN!!' The detective lunges across the deck and secures the watchman, who being as impressed with the deduction as everyone else, readily admits to having sought to gain rank by the murder.","800510":"<b>Careful analysis of the scene</b> reveals two leads. Some believe an autopsy would leave the facts of the case plain, while others reckon the little time available should be spent analysing any evidence at the scene that might establish whodunnit.","800511":"<b>This lot aren't bloodhounds that's for sure,</b> and turn up nothing even with a strong whiff of murder about it all. With the incompetent investigation ending conspicuously silent, the crew must last the remainder of the expedition in fear they are marked next on the list.","800512":"Conduct an autopsy of the body","800513":"Fashion a tool for gathering forensic evidence","800514":"<b>The autopsy is conducted very capably,</b> and confirms the midshipman took his own life. A severe tumour is also discovered on the midshipman's brain. A letter, found later, serves to explain that the fellow knew he hadn't long to live, and wished to face death in his own way. The crew are galvanised on hearing this story of bravery.","800515":"<b>The autopsy is sufficient to confirm it was murder.</b> Strangulation was the cause of death, not a slit throat - which was added post-mortem. All else remains unknown. Nevertheless, with the cause of death established, the list of suspects is narrowed down to just a few who had the means and the motive for the crime.","800516":"<b>The autopsy is dreadfully clumsy,</b> and leaves the body almost unrecognisable. The unschooled 'medic' evidently have a point to prove, and insist on defiling it further, despite being a bundle of nerves. By the end the morgue looks like a butchery, and the stricken mortician runs wildly about the ship, scalpel in hand. Several are injured trying to restrain him, but the psychological trauma of an unsolved mystery is twice as damaging.","800517":"Interrogate until someone confesses","800518":"Beat out a confession","800519":"<b>You out the grim truth.</b> The alibi of one sailor does not match his fellows, and he cracks, confessing to the midshipman's murder. It transpires the midshipman had bragged of bedding the other man's wife. The murderer expresses only remorse for his crime, and as the noose is placed around his neck, the crew regret that justice must be so severe.","800520":"<b>The interrogation is painfully haphazard.</b> Though it is clear one of the suspects must be the killer, lines of inquiry fail to produce answers. No option remains but to offload all the suspects at the next port to prevent further incident. It is a source of great shame to the crew that fine innocent sailors are certain to be among them.","800521":"<b>A brutal approach, but one delivering quick results.</b> It seems the midshipman was preparing to whistle-blow unauthorised smuggling below deck, and was killed for it. The ringleaders threatened others with a similar fate if they didn't keep quiet. The culprits are unceremoniously shot, and the vulgar matter is over.","800522":"<b>Torture seldom results in happiness.</b> Your victim screams a confession, perhaps in the hope it will end the pain. With nothing else to go on, you scapegoat the poor beggar, and he is keelhauled until dead. The crew are in no doubt that this was the wrong man, and hope to escape your inhuman expedition at the first opportunity.","800523":"<b>What innovation!</b> A bright young spark applies some of the latest forensic researches. The knife used to cut the midshipman's neck is placed inside an airtight box along with vapours belonging to the doctor. As if by magic, when removed, clear sets of fingerprints appear on the shaft! When the crew prints are taken, the guilty party is collared in the most satisfying modern fashion!","800524":"<b>It's complicated</b> identifying footwear and gait. Ambitious of the crew then, to attempt to solve both problems with the one device. Still the notched stick-wheel does prove footprints at the scene are suspicious, and that suspects are limited to just a few matches. But how to get to the bottom of this?","800525":"<b>Fragile justice!</b> As your craftsmen stare at an empty drawing board, gormless sailors think they help by tidying up the crime scene. With the investigation fumbled, the killer feels he has to take two more lives before he is finally caught. 'Can't believe how sloppy you are in the art of policing,' he teases, 'I could have killed ten more before you'd found me.' Caught he may be, but the damage is already done.","800526":"Let there be a trial","800527":"Put the fear of god into the suspects","800528":"Dump all the suspects at the next port, and be done with it","800529":"<b>The trial goes as well as can be expected.</b> The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was  trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.","800530":"<b>The trial is a farce.</b> Sailors bark questions from the sidelines which the suspects are quite within their rights to leave unanswered. But this obstinacy serves only to rile the shouting mob! They flood through the makeshift courtroom and carry the suspects kicking and screaming to deck, before tossing them over the side.","800532":"<b>It's almost like divine intervention.</b> The priest hears each suspect alone, and once the god-fearing killer breaks down and confesses, he is handed his rope. Still, a lack of forgiveness does not trouble the crew, who are relieved this ungodly chapter is now closed.","800533":"<b>These are not god-fearing sailors,</b> and hear the priest's weak plea for the killer to come forward with impassive expressions. Perhaps there is a different approach.","800534":"The Singular Case of the Midshipman","800537":"The Visitation","800538":"<b>An undesirable visitor haunts the ship.</b> Fleeting silhouettes, knocking and screeching sounds. Each morning the ship appears in utter disarray. 'A night fiend,' gulps the hardiest of old crewmen, as he sweeps debris from the deck. As night draws in again, you realise something must be done.","800539":"Listen to your expert","800540":"Perform an exorcism","800541":"Find the culprit","800542":"Ignore the menace","800543":"<b>Every right to a little joke.</b> 'These claw marks!' the naturalist feigns horror. 'Is it something terrible?!' asks a fearful sailor. But the naturalist can bite tongue no longer, and succumbs to laughter; 'No! Good heavens. We have a mother and kittens aboard!' The cat family is found in a barrel, which, it is agreed, shall serve as their home for the duration. The crew dote on the little rascals, their presence a great comfort.","800544":"<b>Each sailor strides with inner conviction,</b> as they form a procession of candles behind the smug-looking priest, flooding holy light into every heathen crevice. The priest's ritual is unfaltering, and not only are the crew rid of the night-time menace, but now believe it is god's plan the expedition will succeed.","800545":"<b>The crew has its sceptics,</b> even though the exorcism seems at first to have worked. Two days later a sailor cries, 'It had glowing yellow eyes!' upon having sighted the demon near the hold. The unholy thing must be caught.","800546":"Bait the thing with food","800547":"<b>It is nothing so savage.</b> All are concealed around the strip of meat, expecting the worst. But what descends from the rafters of the hold, silent and gentle winged, is a luminous white owl. It is an ambiguous omen, according to those that know, but the sailors are content to keep it aboard.","800548":"<b>Whatever it is, it is far too clever.</b> It avoids the bait, but continues its night raids. Rumour this is an offended Klabautermann are substantiated by several separate accounts. Little voices overheard, brief sightings, even the discovery of a miniature table and chair. Some can live with the impish nuisance, but many will jump ship at the next port..","800549":"Build a trap to catch the thing","800550":"<b>The cage-trap is well-made,</b> and daybreak reveals an unlikely specimen encaged. 'A sort of badger?' is the first analysis, which in actuality, is fairly far from the mark. The compendium of animalia in the ship's library reveals it a 'northern raccoon', also remarking that is 'quite edible.'","800551":"<b>The snapping trap is weak and flimsy.</b> The crew are excited by a sharp sound, but rush to the scene, only to find the bait gone, and the trap in disrepair. A piece of bright red felt caught in the spring explains all. 'Klabautermann!' they despair, for it is a terrible omen to offend a sea goblin as they have done.","800552":"<b>The crew don't have much belief,</b> and the priest makes a hash of the exorcism. If anything, his fragmented delivery only agitates the creature. The next night, a sailor is adamant he has sighted something 'irrefutably demonic.'","800553":"<b>The faithless crew never take any part of the exorcism seriously.</b> 'What's the point of hocus-pocus when its but greedy sailors stealing?!' yells one man. Accusations fly between conspiracy theorists, until a violent brawl breaks out. At the next mooring, the injured parties desert your godless expedition.","800554":"Gather arms and confront it","800555":"Sate the demon with a sacrificial offering","800556":"Don't anger the creature further","800557":"<b>Rather excessive.</b> The soldiery tense as strange noises draw near. Fingers itch upon triggers. The moment demon wings flap into view, the night is lit up with powder. Finally the smoke subsides, and the mangled thing is revealed to be nothing more than a bat. Troops thunder heavily about the ship, before discovering the rest of the hog-nosed critters in the hold. Everyone is left feeling utterly stupid.","800558":"<b>Your lily-livered cowards quiver like jelly!</b> Fear chokes them as they spin wildly about looking for something to shoot that they can't see. Two are so panicked they bump together, causing the other to suddenly fire. Shot hits an angelic young sailor, killing instantly. The night terror is gone, but has taken for payment the most undeserving of souls.","800559":"<b>A man's finger for a stowaway weasel!</b> In good faith, a pious sailor volunteers the pinkie of his right hand as a votive offering. But at the smell of blood, it is a slinky little mustelid that appears. With the weasel caught and caged, the night terror is over, but the sailors will not forgive or forget the loss of a good man's finger.","800560":"<b>Sacrilege!</b> A prohibited tome is consulted, the vile solicitations of its pages consuming the crew! Unspeakable acts are performed upon a man, so that the demon can be assuaged. Yet still the menace remains, and worse, the crew's sacrificial victim bleeds out from his injuries.","800561":"<b>The practical joke is ruined.</b> The bored sailors bemoan the pathetic response to their little entertainment. That the senior officers have been duped by an obvious ruse, makes all severely doubt their fitness to lead.","800563":"<b>Your sharp-nosed hunters pick up a scent.</b> Pungent droppings demarcate a perimeter, in the centre of which is a crate with a hole. A sailor reaches his arm bravely in. There is a brief struggle, and a whine like the ones at night, before the troublemaker is pulled out. It is a common garden fox. The cunning little creature becomes the crew's talisman for the remainder of the expedition.","800564":"<b>Hunters find tracks, but can't say what made them.</b> The marks are indeed strange - disturbing almost. Claw marks that go deep in the decking, as if the unspeakable thing that made them was in some frenzy.","800565":"<b>The hunters stumble guilelessly into its trap.</b> The night is unfeasibly pitch, and the hunters' lamps extinguish. Who knows why, without a breath of wind? A scratching draws near. Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence.  Just like that, the fiend  has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed.","800566":"Smoke it out of hiding","800567":"Build a trap to catch whatever it is","800568":"Pray together against the spirit","800569":"<b>Reassuringly human coughing comes from within.</b> It turns out you have a stowaway - a young girl wishing to escape a life of hardship. She is spirited., and the crew take to her quickly. She is given work to do, and food to eat. All believe she shall prove their good luck charm.","800570":"<b>Knowing its habits helps.</b> The box is made to measure, and along with its clever latch, is placed where the fiend seems most often to be. The box is found in the morning, with a gigantic rat inside it. The trap appears to have killed it, and that is the end of the matter.","800571":"<b>The ramshackle trap box is in bits the next morning.</b> While to some they appear benign, the claw marks appear more frequently. Once a man wakes with his cheeks gouged. Some are so perturbed by the night demon, that they slink off the ship at the next available harbour.","800572":"<b>A feeling of calm descends upon the crew.</b> The prayer seems to fill the spiritual void in the sailor's breasts. Approaching the world with a new perspective means even if the unexplained episodes at night persist, they pay it no mind.","800573":"<b>The communal prayer is broken by more wild shrieking.</b> It matters not that, apart from vanishing supplies, the mischievous spirit seems fairly harmless. The crew are deeply troubled, and worry their souls are lost.","800574":"<b>The menace is very persistent.</b> Restless nights, devoured food, and stolen supplies shall go unexplained and unresolved for the remainder of the expedition. The crew are at their wit's end.","800575":"Lost in the Desert","800576":"<b>The map of these endless dunes is a swindle.</b> The first officer turns to berate the guide from whom they were purchased, but the fellow is already gone, as if the sands had swallowed him up. A solitary well offers a slight dribble of consolation, but your men must otherwise come to terms with being rather lost.","800577":"Use a reflective object to signal help","800578":"Navigate by the stars","800579":"Wait for a sign of the true path","800580":"Walk stubbornly in one direction","800581":"<b>A local rider comes to the rescue.</b> He saunters over on his camel, and explains the well is part of a lost city, accessible over a small rise. The crew are enchanted by the grand quarry, swept over by the sands of time, observations of which shall no doubt bring them fame on their return. After proof of their remarkable discovery has been gathered, the rider is only too glad to lead the elated crew back to more familiar dunes.","800582":"<b>Clear desert nights are perfect for astronomers.</b> Beneath a black cloak lucid with the constellations, your expert navigators school the remainder in mankind's relation to the heavenly bodies. It is a moment of realisation for many. Enlightened, the crew return to the ship filled with the wonder of the desert and their place in the universe.","800583":"<b>Something of a path appears</b>, though as much by luck as star-gazing. A little way along it, a silhouette crenellates the night - an imposing fortress. Too tired for trouble, you wonder if it is worth knocking at the grand door.","800584":"<b>The \"stars are fickle\", say your officers by way of excuse.</b> After traveling for a while, the familiar shape of the well appears in the darkness. Your men have been walking in a circle.","800585":"<b>The stars utterly perplex your party.</b> With romantic notions dashed, the crew look around for some landmark, but instead find a featureless wasteland. They are desperately lost. Water, food and hope are in increasingly short supply. But even in a desert, there must be a way...","800586":"Ask at the fort for help","800587":"Ignore the fort and continue along the path","800588":"<b>The occupant Sultan welcomes you in.</b> He introduces himself in his own tongue, and is impressed by your interpreters. \"You are far from what you seek. Stay, replenish for the journey ahead.\" Thus the crew enjoy the Sultan's hospitality while they can, for it will ease the last stretch of their journey.","800589":"<b>You lack the means to communicate.</b> Believing you to be an invasion force, the paranoid Sultan orders hot oil be poured from the ramparts. There is no escaping for one, eaten alive by the molten cascade. Resuming your desert path is the only option. The journey is a wearying lament for a fallen friend, meandering slowly back to civilisation.","800590":"<b>It is a long and draining journey.</b> Finally the crew limp exhausted into a settlement, from where it will no doubt be possible to procure the appropriate charts. Most would be happy never to see those grumpy old camels ever again.","800591":"Follow the local wildlife","800592":"Divine for Water","800593":"Move bravely on","800594":"<b>Desperate thanks are due to a dung beetle.</b> As it scuttles along, those less capable in coleopterology cast doubt on the value of pursuing it. There is a minor scuffle in the sand before at last the bloody-nosed experts are listened to. The jolly beetle leads to owl dung, and owls in turn to farmland. Thus the embittered and exhausted crew are saved from desiccation.","800595":"<b>A wild goose chase to desolation.</b> Though the ostrich your crew have found cannot fly, it lollops along at surprisingly high speed. They try in vain to follow, but the sun is twice its usual size, and the bird is gone. Hot sand melts soles, and feet begin to swell. The water is out. Those that make it must have some evolutionary adaptation, because for most the desert is to be their graveyard.","800596":"<b>Your reprobates have no knowledge of desert mysteries.</b> The divining rod has wasted enough of your time, and your caravan is nearly through the water.","800597":"<b>A pretty price for divine mercy.</b> The Y-shaped stick leads all on a meandering path. One insists on stopping to dig, and is left behind. It is a wasted, and fatal effort. After two days of hardship, the rest stumble over a crest to discover the wide blue sea, their mocking ship upon it.","800598":"<b>The sun is unspeakably hot.</b> As the bedraggled lumber back to civilisation, there are wiltings among them. It is too much for the others to turn their heads. Bodies slumping to ash and dust, lost to the waves of a powder sea.","800599":"<b>Star of wonder, star of light!</b> Your wise magi are stirred by an unusually bright celestial body, that is surely a sign! It foretells a spiritual pilgrimage through the desert leading to a Garden of Eden. A grove of flowing streams, orange and incense, where like-minded devotees congregate. Your crew feel blessed, and the expedition can resume with new-found devotion.","800600":"<b>Are the gods testing you?</b> You wait and wait but there is not yet a sign.","800601":"<b>The omen is a ravaging howl.</b> \"Water in the desert?! it's coming from everywhere!\" Already up to their necks in strong current, the weak swimmers flounder like ants in a bathtub. Those that do not drown must wait until morning to look upon the aftermath. \"A flood from heaven, to punish the wicked,\" say the survivors, as they trudge back to civilisation.","800602":"<b>You are extremely lucky to survive.</b> The crew whinge and whine the whole way about scattergun strategy. After a day without shade, a fight even breaks out. But sticking to the fixed heading eventually leads, not before time, back to some kind of reality.","800603":"<b>Your expedition boils.</b> Further and further it goes, into the desert's incandescent interior. Each soul more and more convinced that redemption is over the next dune. But it is not. Three days later, the party might have felt relief at the sight of a caravan, but instead end up wishing they had died with their comrades.","800605":"A Grizzly Encounter","800606":"<b>Bear attack!</b> The party ponder this very real possibility as threatening grunts stop them dead among the firs. Fifty yards ahead, a huge specimen lurches up on two legs like a totem, standing between them and escape. More grunting echoes nearby. The party stay silent, awaiting guidance.","800607":"Scare the bears away","800608":"Use hunting knowledge to get the better of the bears","800609":"Attack the bear blocking the way","800610":"Use Camouflage","800611":"<b>Boooooom!</b> The valley shudders with the sweet stench of exploded dynamite. The bears hurry away, leaving the crew thoroughly entertained at the superiority of mankind and the power of invention.","800612":"<b>Trust in the expert hunters never feels misplaced</b>, even when they recommend the party break into passionate song. For singing the shanty 'Cheerly-ay-oh' brings the crew together, whilst also dispersing the wary bears deep into the forest.","800613":"<b>The hunters lack guile.</b> They have enough to lead the crew on a route silent as a church, but not enough to stop a bear sniffing them out. It's easy to believe from its vacant eyes, that it sees you as a potentially delicious kind of threat.","800614":"<b>Call themselves hunters!</b> The tracks thought to lead away from bear territory go instead to a clearing at its heart. The bears at first seem alarmed their picnic is disturbed, until they realise your crew are on the menu. The sound of crunching bone rings in the ears of the few that manage to flee.","800615":"Attack the bear","800616":"Outmanoeuvre the bear","800617":"<b>The bear's face proves a good target.</b> Ducking the terrifying whooshes of its paws, someone manages to prime their pistol and shoot it through the eye. The bear drops dead. No-one feels particularly good about killing it, but the way ahead is now clear.","800618":"<b>Adaptation is good when a fight isn't going well.</b> The bear flinches but does not drop after the first round of gunfire. There is no time to reload, before it is upon them with its paws. Knocked down the men are smart enough to play dead. After an hour or so facing the floor, the bears lose interest and leave. The crew are able to lick their wounds, and move on.","800619":"<b>It's easy to underestimate mummy bears.</b> As the soldiers fluff the loading of their weapons, the bear nonchalantly grasps one by the wrist, and sinks her jaw into his neck. The others panic and flee with their arms in the air. She pursues a second, striking him dead against a rock. Now she and her cubs can finally be left in peace.","800620":"<b>Sometimes it helps to know your hill contours.</b> The crew carefully fall away, circumventing the bear's position, and keeping their backs to the mountainside. With the higher ground, the bear appears to lose interest. Hearts pumping, the crew hurry to safety.","800621":"<b>Stupidly the crew decide to run, and reach a dead-end.</b> The bear pursues at a leisurely speed, yet with no less menace, and the crew are forced to seek refuge in a cave, or else try climbing the trees.","800623":"Hide in the cave and pray","800624":"Climb the trees","800625":"<b>Against all anxiety, the Bear doesn't follow.</b> Still, the men in the cave are too afraid to light a fire, or sleep through the night. Shattered and hungry, they emerge the next morning, only to find their sacrifice was wholly unnecessary.","800626":"<b>Bears can see terribly well in the dark</b>, and since your crew have stumbled into its house, where its vulnerable infants sleep, it is not very happy. The crew that do manage to break for daylight have clothes ragged and torn, and cannot speak, for it is clear they were the lucky ones.","800627":"<b>The crew climb the trees well enough</b>, but the bear isn't going to make their lives easy. It is a full day and night before it gives up shaking trunks, or climbing halfway up towards the dangling crew. When it finally leaves, the exhausted crew descend, their nerves in shreds.","800628":"<b>Bears are awfully good at climbing trees</b>, and as on this occasion, it is not uncommon to see them strike their adversaries from the branches. Its hapless victim plunges from the canopy and lands like a sack of red berries on rocks below. Others injure themselves as the men drop from the trees in a desperate escape.","800629":"<b>The lone bear's haunch is picked out with expert marksmanship.</b> It staggers before bounding off into the woods. Your crew are delighted to return to the safety of the ship, whilst also having done the mighty beast no lasting harm.","800630":"<b>The first volley of shots miss</b>, and the bear attacks. A second shot finds its mark, and the wounded bear escapes into the trees, but a man lies dead. His brother cries revenge, and is already off into the woods to hunt the grisly killer.","800631":"<b>Out here, bears rule.</b> The wildly inaccurate gunfire  serves only to rile the bear into a frenzy, and draw attention to your position. Then a second, larger bear thunders from the undergrowth and mauls a man to death. A few of your piffling soldiery manage to escape with all their limbs attached.","800632":"Track the wounded bear with him","800633":"Leave the fool behind","800634":"<b>Bittersweet.</b> Your fine tracking skills allow the crew to catch up with the bear and watch it from hiding. It is a she-bear, and is now nuzzling its young cubs. 'That is why she killed him,' says the brother, gone all vitriol. 'Let us leave, and hope my brother's spirit may somehow live on in this place.'","800635":"<b>The hot-headed hunt is a success none celebrate.</b> Once found, the bear no longer has strength to defend itself. As the brother drives a stake into its heart, it gives over with a last sad sigh. In that moment a tiny cub pads into the open, crawling weakly under the limp arm of its mother. If only they had understood, the crew could have saved the heartache.","800636":"<b>Hunting is impossible with passions running this high.</b> When another man snaps a twig, the vengeful brother attacks him wildly, and the others fail to intervene. The brother's eyes glaze as he slides to the earth, bayonet in his back.","800637":"<b>The decision is unpopular.</b> 'Stubborn 'til the end,' say those in the minority. But the greater part have things to say on the subject of dishonour. 'Those brothers loved each other to the end,' remarks one old sailor, 'and what little love did we show for them...'","800638":"<b>The bears have no chance.</b> Indeed, the camouflage is so good, the crew can barely see one another! Thickly daubed in the colours of the forest, the chameleon crew bypass the bears with ease. A story of ingenuity at which their grandchildren shall marvel!","800639":"<b>Even the most hardened sailors find the smell unbearable.</b> Not to mention the indignity of covering oneself in bear excrement for longer than is perfectly necessary. Eventually though the bears depart, leaving the reeking crew free to have a much-needed wash.","800640":"<b>Dressing as pantomime trees is a bad idea</b>, and as the bears attack, the flimsy branches the crew intended to cover their faces prove no more effective in self-defence. The ensuing scene might have made for an impressive spectacle on the stage, though only as the most gruesome of tragedies.","800658":"The locals look expectant.","800659":"Deal","800660":"No Deal","800663":"The Seven-Year Itch","800664":"<b>The crew are beset by insatiable and painful itching!</b> From lieutenants down to pigeon-keepers, they twist and turn in their bunks and cannot sleep. It is affecting their capacity to carry out the most basic duties, something must be done!","800665":"Wash more often!","800666":"Analyse the symptoms","800667":"Find somewhere to stop and be rid of it","800668":"Let them itch, it's common at sea","800669":"<b>Washing a splendid idea at sea? Who knew?!</b> The itching is very soon forgotten, as the sailors cavort through rainbows of expurgating bubbles. The rich perfume below deck is a welcome reminder of family and bygone days.","800670":"<b>'Only jellyfish!' says the cultivated doctor cheerfully.</b> 'Our refreshing swim at that cove appears to be the cause. It must have been rife with their larvae!' The crew marvel at the clever diagnosis, and as the itching subsides, bask in the pioneering case-study they have performed for the benefit of humankind.","800671":"<b>The red welts seem to perplex the doctor.</b> 'There is evidence of the parasitic,' he splutters as he peers through his magnifying glass, 'but then it could be nothing at all!'","800672":"<b>The doctor is a demented quack.</b> When the condition is established correctly as crusted scabies - contagious, but hardly dangerous - the doctor's experiment is for the affected to bathe in an acid solution. Needless to say, his victims do not survive their injuries. When the expedition returns, it is entirely possible he may be stripped of his profession.","800673":"Examine the cabins for some sort of parasite","800674":"Have the afflicted bathe in holy water","800675":"<b>There are bedbugs everywhere!</b> There must be something that can be done to exterminate these disc-bodied hangers-on!","800676":"<b>They cannot see the wood for the trees!</b> Evidence of fleas would be everywhere to the right pair of eyes. Two weeks pass, and murine typhus breaks out. Rashes, fever and vomiting grip the fleas' hosts, who are never able to find the cause of their itching agony.","800677":"Refurbish the cabins","800678":"Simply change the sheets","800679":"<b>The matter is craftily 'put-to-bed'.</b> Despite the time-consuming upheaval, the crew are surprised to have their cabins so well refurbished. 'They're too soft on us,' says a jolly cove inspecting the new bunks, but my britches haven't itched all day.'","800680":"<b>What dreary decor!'</b> says the Lieutenant tartly. Matters deteriorate when some ill-fashioned bunks collapse. 'I'd rather have the itching back,' says an exhausted-looking sailor. Like others, he has to sleep out on the hard decking, until some competent craftsmen can come aboard.","800681":"<b>It is a job half-done.</b> For most the problem goes away, but  some must live with the itching. Wherever the bugs' nasty little hidey-hole is, it must still reel with lousy punters, each telling stories of the sailor blood they drained the night before.","800682":"<b>The priest's most divine bottle does the trick.</b> 'This water is indeed holy!' he says, as the fearsome muscovite vodka from 1791 is uncorked and slapped over the itches of the queuing sailors. 'Shame to use it like this, but I'd rather sleep,' he cackles.","800683":"<b>'Is nothing sacred anymore?'</b> Says the priest, who turns up his nose at the suggestion of using his water for something so humdrum. 'The lord hath bigger fish to fry,' he says pointedly. As well as the vile and incessant itching, the crew now have a parsimonious priest to contend with.","800684":"<b>Sand and sun is a panacea!</b> An acute sense of direction leads the ship to an island paradise. A freshwater lagoon relieves the itching, and the much-needed relaxation will stand all in good stead for the journey ahead.","800685":"<b>Bringing contagion to port might be a bad idea.</b> The itching is at its worst by the time the expedition reaches the bustling alien seaport, something the local authorities don't fail to notice. The harbour-master's tug escorts you to quarantine. How do you escape?","800686":"<b>It's impossible for your aimless navigators to concentrate.</b> The expedition fidgets wildly off course, with no land in sight. Meanwhile the assassin bugs continue to spread their dreadful disease. Even they'd probably make better navigators! Then there wouldn't have to be quite so much death!","800687":"Lie that the sickness isn't contagious","800688":"Threaten them into letting you go","800689":"Await quarantine","800690":"<b>The lie works like a charm.</b> A doctor promptly comes aboard to confirm this hypothesis. Although she sternly points out the condition is contagious after all, she also recognises it to be a mild complaint. 'Crabs,' the translator says, face flushing. The crew are too relieved to feel embarrassed.","800692":"<b>It is obvious you are lying,</b> and the authorities are not impressed. They allow several days to pass, without any word on your ship's release.","800693":"<b>They don't want any trouble.</b> A doctor comes aboard ship and goes nervously about his business. Although the atmosphere is somewhat cagey, medicines for your crew's skin conditions are provided, and the expedition can continue on its way.","800694":"<b>You underestimate them.</b> Two surprise warships hove round the landspit and close in to firing range. There is no choice but to run. As your ship crashes wildly out between jetties, the escort ship pincers, and opens fire. The effect is catastrophic. Your modest vessel flees in tatters, and many good sailors are dead or wounded. For the rest, the itching is set to continue.","800695":"<b>It's a long time before the authorities deal with you,</b> with bureaucracy seemingly a way of life here. When you finally have access to a medical professional, there is already a post-mortem to be conducted. It appears chemicals leeched into the water supply and caused the rashes and sickness. With the water changed, the others recover, but it cannot redeem the loss of a life.","800696":"<b>It is a particularly awful itch however.</b> The disgusting lice infesting the ship, and discomfort thereof has many questioning the worth of your expedition. There is only so much scratching a crew can take before they lose all appetite for the journey ahead.","800698":"<b>Widespread suspicion is the undesirable outcome.</b> Ignorance of the full circumstances surrounding the death has the crew feeling powerless. You must accept that quarrels and accusations will now be routine until the end of this expedition.","800701":"That's the spot!","800702":"You have discovered a suitable area for a base camp! The first step to rescue Captain Faithful is done. Lady Faithful will be thankful.","800704":"An Ominous Encounter","800705":"<b>You are chased by an iron dragon!</b> A formidable boat powered by steam, and heavily armed! It has followed you ever since your expedition left port. 'If it is hostile, why does it not fire at us?' your helmsman cries, as its black-scale bows surge nearer and nearer. Its pennants bear the same fearful mark as the pages of your father's diary...","800706":"Turn and fight","800707":"Outrun the dragon","800708":"<b>Your direct hits do little damage.</b> They cannot penetrate the dragon's thick hide. <b>The dragon is alongside you.</b> Its iron mouth opens like a flower, revealing the fire in its lungs. Cowled figures manipulate the levers within. They mean to burn you!","800712":"<b>The dragon boat is too nimble.</b> Your ponderous cannons only lob their ordnance into its wake. <b>The dragon is alongside you.</b> Its iron mouth opens like a flower, revealing the fire in its lungs. Cowled figures manipulate the levers within. They mean to burn you!","800713":"Disable its fiery weapon","800714":"Begin evasive manoeuvres!","800715":"<b>Hot stuff!</b> Your guns warp the dragon jaws shut. It's operators cry out, before their ship destructs in its own flame! That'll teach them to mess with a Goode. <b>Wonder who they were?</b> Someone didn't want you to reach The New World. Finding an ally like Isabel Sarmento as Sir Archibald suggested, is vital if you are to fathom this shadowy new threat.","800716":"<b>Your hull is toast</b> by the time your aimless gunners give the beast something to chew on. No time to celebrate their destruction when your own ship is on fire... <b>Wonder who they were?</b> Someone didn't want you to reach The New World. Finding an ally like Isabel Sarmento as Sir Archibald suggested, is vital if you are to fathom this shadowy new threat.","800717":"<b>The crew cheer!</b> The dance is a fluent chassé, your ship always a step ahead, until the wind fills the sails, and the enemy ironclad is left standing. <b>Wonder who they were?</b> Someone didn't want you to reach The New World. Finding an ally like Isabel Sarmento as Sir Archibald suggested, is vital if you are to fathom this shadowy new threat.","800718":"<b>Bungling navigators.</b> Your ship turns the wrong way, and the sails sag.

No time for celebration when your deck and crew are afire! <b>Wonder who they were?</b> Someone didn't want you to reach The New World. Finding an ally like Isabel Sarmento, as Sir Archibald suggested, is vital if you are to fathom this shadowy new threat.","800721":"Hot on the trail...","800722":"<b>'The rebels know Isabel's whereabouts...'</b> announces the captain, '...we will not last long here without her.' Porto Fogo's tropical shoreline twinkles, its white walls glow. But as you draw toward the terracotta rooftops, you find not the warm welcome you were expecting. <b>The place is crawling with La Corona.</b> They have driven Isabel's freedom fighters away, who it seems until recently had been holding out. You have to discover the location of the secret camp to which the rebels have now been taken.","800723":"Search for the prison camp","800724":"Squeeze a local for information","800725":"Try to bribe an La Corona soldier","800726":"<b>Footprints in the sand!</b> Two sets. The middle barefoot, and numerous. On either side, fewer and booted. The La Corona guards led prisoners from here into the foothills. <b>You reach the camp, where the rebel prisoners are well-guarded.</b> On the exposed cliff, your options are limited, but you must find Isabel Sarmento! You can storm it, sneak it, or try bluffing it.","800727":"<b>\"Aargh my foot!\"</b> a man yelps, as you climb into the foothills. Bear traps.

You can storm it, sneak it, or try bluffing it.","800728":"Storm the camp","800729":"Sneak into the camp","800730":"Dress as La Corona officers and bluff your way in","800731":"<b>You take them completely by surprise.</b> 'Who are you?' the camp commander shrinks in his padded chair, 'none of these dumb rebels were ever that bold!' The prisoners are freed and lead to safety. Once they have had soup and a good night's sleep, a clue as to their mysterious Isabel's whereabouts may be more forthcoming.","800732":"<b>It's bloody.</b> Despite having a start on the guards, gunsmoke soon fills the air. Your men have the edge, and get the prisoners out, but good people on both sides have died today. Once they have had soup and a good night's sleep, a clue as to their mysterious Isabel's whereabouts may be more forthcoming.","800733":"<b>Joyous faces return.</b> Your crew are so adept at stealth, that the hoots of ashy-faced owls are all that can be heard. A quick punch to the back of the head, and the cell guard is out. The rebels are finally free! Once they have had soup and a good night's sleep, a clue as to their mysterious Isabel's whereabouts may be more forthcoming.","800734":"<b>Not all make it.</b> It had gone well - the careful approach, the guards taken care of, until one of your dimwits screeched open the cell door. Then they had to run for it. Once they have had soup and a good night's sleep, a clue as to their mysterious Isabel's whereabouts may be more forthcoming.","800735":"<b>It's great theatre.</b> Playing the gruff La Corona general, your spy blags the freedom of the camp. He returns with as many prisoners he can free, each grateful no longer to be a lab rat. Once they have had soup and a good night's sleep, a clue as to their mysterious Isabel's whereabouts may be more forthcoming.","800736":"<b>Shots are fired,</b> the moment your silly gaggle of clowns approach. You only succeed in putting the whole camp on alert.","800738":"<b>Your careful appeal finds eager ears.</b> 'Brave, dear Isabel,' the woman weeps softly.

You can storm it, sneak it, or try bluffing it.","800739":"<b>\"Our Isabel?\"</b> the woman yells too loud. Your clumsy envoy finally calms her, and she directs you to the prison camp.

'Why not an X?' says the captain with an air of disappointment. 'Sarmento!' says Ramón, his eyes sparkling with life, 'She is the key to everything. Without her, you will be nothing here but an La Corona pawn.' It seems your father must have thought the same.","800748":"Take the most direct land route to Isabel","800749":"Build a raft and take the quicker river route","800750":"<b>Nought is wrong with your compass.</b> But this is not the picnic you thought it would be. Dense and dark is the rainforest, it feeds on your hope. But what's this? Human tracks! Does all hope return?","800751":"<b>'Why didn't we stick to the map?!'</b> moan your crew at gunpoint.

Not all of them will survive the journey down.","800947":"<b>Toboggans are better where it's flat.</b> Though solidly made, the going is fast. One sled veers into a ravine. A cry below: 'Officer injured', but the wind is picking up.","800948":"<b>The clumsy snowshoes fail you.</b> Whether it is in their design or construction, every step sinks the party deeper. They do not yet know, but the cold will take them all.","800949":"Descend and help the officer","800951":"Hope they manage alone","800952":"<b>The doctor works quickly.</b> Just what is needed with another blizzard brewing. 'Temporary strapping,' he says, 'but should get us home.' The officer and rest of the party make shelter with little time left to spare.","800953":"<b>The doctor knows nothing of urgency.</b> 'Give my patient space!' he snaps at those trying to move things along. Meanwhile, a blizzard sweeps the ravine, and the onset of frostbite is enough to split the party. Neither the doctor nor his unfortunate patient are to be seen again.","800954":"<b>You knew deep down not all would make it.</b> 'They're all returned but the injured fellow,' comes the news. 'There was no saving him, the way he was. Ice stripped the meat from his bones like a chef's mandorre.'","800955":"Follow the divine voice","800956":"Urge your party to face their fears","800957":"<b>A heavenly, enlightened voice calls.</b> None stop to look down, so enchanted are they. Over a verge, appears a shrine with a great bell - the source of the sound - and beyond, a pilgrims' path to the foot of the mountain.","800958":"<b>A non-believer falls to his death.</b> 'Those lacking conviction shall be tried and judged in this place,' echoes the priest. The rest edge to safety, consoled by the apparent goodness in their hearts.","800960":"<b>Nothing but a demonic howl.</b> The blizzard rises anew. Without hope to keep them aloft, it is no surprise when a ledge gives way, damning to hell below.","800961":"<b>A song of solidarity rises through the line of snow-crusted faces.</b> Clinging to what they most cherish, they edge to safety. Had they not been reminded of such incentives, it is doubtful they would have survived.","800962":"<b>Only some take strength.</b> The rest remain in a frozen huddle. They may have lacked courage to negotiate the high ledge, but will welcome in their icy death with creditable stoicism.","800964":"Free climb","800965":"Craft longer ropes and swing down","800966":"<b>All are saved, at a cost.</b> Putting the ropes together is quite a task with frozen fingers. That the party are able to cling to the rope as they descend is a small miracle. Nevertheless, frostbite will do lasting damage to their digits.","800967":"<b>A small but critical detail is overlooked.</b> Grip. A man falls from the top of the rope with a cry, tumbling those below him into the abyss like meat from a skewer. Only a few frozen grimaces survive.","800968":"<b>It is a risky business.</b> Though the cliff isn't lacking in handholds, this is a test of individual endurance. Some were never going to be up to it. As they fall, the will to survive in the others strengthens.","800972":"Baptism of Fire","800973":"<b>Everything points towards the foreboding gate.</b> Salvation lies beyond, but the eerie blue flame that suffuses it keep the crew at a distance. Perhaps it would be safer to find a way through the surrounding jungle, but those of faith say the gate is 'an auspicious sign'.","800974":"Have the scientist look at the gate","800975":"Have faith and leap through the flames.","800976":"Wrap up before leaping through the flames.","800977":"Cut through the jungle instead","800978":"<b>The scientist banishes the illusion.</b> 'This fire that you perceive around the gate, is simply the agglomeration of azure glow-worms.' Laughter becomes delight, as the party take the pulsing creatures in hand. This is the wonder of nature.","800979":"<b>If anything the flames are cool</b>, almost like bundles of ribbons brushing the skin. This gate is, without question, an earthly manifestation of the divine. Ahead, an extremely hospitable settlement affirms the holy blessing.","800980":"<b>The doubtful crew are surprised.</b> Drawing closer to the gate, they find the flames seem to give off no heat. One leap of faith and they are through! Still they hesitate, for a perfect skeleton sits propped against it.","800981":"<b>Fire and brimstone!</b> The heat is intense, but your procession of false prophets seem numb to the pain. The others watch horrified, as fabric, skin and flesh renders before their eyes. If the expedition continues, it will only be for the mercy of god.","800982":"Determine how the person died","800983":"Order them to charge through!","800984":"<b>The doctor forms a reasonable hypothesis</b>, but cannot be absolutely sure from bone alone. 'The way they sit suggests they lacked the will to continue.' Not wishing to end the same way, the crew are astonished to discover that leaping through the gate does them no harm.","800985":"<b>The doctor's career is over.</b> As are the careers of those who heed his words. 'Came through from the other side, but it was not the fire that took him'. As they jump, flames grasp their ankles, and rapidly shoot up and over the rest.","800986":"<b>'Ouch!'</b> The men yelp, rolling in the dirt until they are sure they are no longer afire. The strange arch behind them, your brave soldiers compare their battle scars.","800987":"<b>'Cowards!'</b> Your men lack the military discipline to follow a simple order! You will have to find another way.","800988":"<b>They make it.</b> Rolled-up like carpets they skip through the flaming gate. Their worst complaint is the sweet and overwhelming pong of sweat that now follows them.","800989":"<b>'That they died as sausages!</b> or what shall we tell their families!?' Perhaps dousing their mantles in a protective layer of paraffin was a mistake! Your expedition continues to turn on its spit.","800990":"<b>The crew have no regrets</b> in plotting such a rational course. Sweaty jungles are the devil they know, crawling with tentacle limb and spider fang. But who knew what sorcery governed that strange gate?","800991":"<b>The jungle thins out to a precipice.</b> A long and shoddy-looking bridge stretches to the other side, or else you could attempt to find a way around.","800992":"<b>No way through,</b> thanks to your shambolic mapreading. The group becomes separated, and eventually lost. Hacking those ancient and contorted roots has saved no time that couldn't be saved by backtrack, and cost you several lives into the bargain.","800993":"Inspect the bridge","800994":"Circumnavigate the cliff","800995":"<b>It is in passable condition.</b> There are a few nerve-wracking moments, as the wind whips the bridge into a vigorous sway, and all are rather pleased to reach the other side. Your expedition continues.","800996":"<b>Most treacherous!</b> The confidence of your craftsmen in the rickety structure couldn't be more misplaced. Of course it is nothing if not dramatic, when the bridge cables twang, and one after the other pile into the gorge.","800997":"<b>It is a long trek</b>, that could have been much longer but for the competence of those with a compass. Yet another hiccup for the expedition log book.","800998":"<b>Imbecile orienteers!</b> There is no other way across this river valley for a hundred miles! You have covered half that distance before you realise, wasting a lot of time and provisions.","801001":"Mysterious Artefacts","801002":"<b>The discovery of several strange artefacts aboard spooks the crew.</b> Tied to the rigging, bunks, boards, and even atop the captain's desk. A warning, a threat? And who put them there? Since the nearby island is uninhabited, it is sensible only to think the perpetrator must be aboard. The crew must know or have seen something last night!","801003":"Ask the anthropologist","801004":"Ask the crew who did this","801005":"Throw them overboard and move on.","801006":"<b>'For good luck,'</b> remarks the anthropologist, inspecting the spherical red dolls, 'for the setting of goals, and perseverance in achieving them. Some people or spirit of this place believe they can help us home.' At this, your crew are beguiled.","801007":"<b>Your crew are beginning to bond.</b> Someone comes forward, not having expected to cause such a bother. 'They're for me old mum,' he sighs, 'birds - that one's a little robin. Made 'em together when she was ill. Now she's gone...I...' The others are quick to put an arm round his shoulder; they're all in this together.","801008":"<b>No one has anything to offer but the priest.</b> It is his belief that some unholy chapter has opened. The next morning, more of the eerie things have appeared. 'Cleanse the idols in holy fire!' he shrieks. 'Nonsense,' says a soldier. \"Set guards within, and we shall have this rat.\"","801009":"<b>A destructive episode.</b> No one has information, or perhaps they withhold it. Consensus tends towards the latter. Someone wants this expedition to fail, and these effigies are a threat. Paranoia festers. At the next port, a large part of the crew opts to quit.","801010":"<b>Chilling.</b> As instructed, the crew collect the dolls and throw them overboard. But relief lasts only until the following morning, when the dolls are found returned, placed exactly as they had been.","801011":"Side with the priest and prepare a holy fire","801012":"Keep guard and capture the perpetrator","801013":"<b>The priest gloats over his success.</b> With a maniacal grin, he sets the mound of idols alight. The fire consumes rapidly, shifting vermillion to viridian. Some say they hear the wood scream as it goes. 'Expurgation is God's work, and I am chosen.'","801014":"<b>The fire is chaotic</b>, and the buckets of water seem not to extinguish, but provoke. The flame leaps to the priest's cassock like spring-heeled jack, and as it sweeps up his back, he is heard to utter his last words, 'forgive me father, for I have sinned.'","801015":"<b>The teenagers are remorseful.</b> 'It was a jape, a piece o' trickery sirs, we regret t'were not received so.' The crew are forgiving - the youths merely wished to contain their homesickness - and call for just fifty strokes of the birch per bottom.","801016":"<b>That night, dire musket-shot is heard.</b> A dead boy on deck, local. A second is seen diving to blue. Next morning a rhythm comes from an armada of river boats, armed with guns. There island is inhabited, and they know what you have done.","801017":"<b>The sun is solemn that morning.</b> The bodies of the dead guards are borne to the hold for burial, but not here, upon this cursed rock. Who killed them none know but the sinister effigies. The expedition fumbles on.","801018":"Engage in battle.","801019":"Leave immediately.","801020":"<b>One warning salvo is enough.</b> The river boats cluster and slow. Though they lower their weapons and allow you to leave, the anger that your crime  goes unpunished couldn't be more marked in their faces.","801021":"<b>Your ship is a sitting duck.</b> Your crew cannot man stations fast enough to fire or manoeuvre. Enemy boats surround your ship, before scaling its sides. The blood shed on both sides will stain this ship and expedition forever.","801022":"<b>Once your ship is underway she is free.</b> Nevertheless your adversaries are excellent shots, and do damage to the sails and aft. The crew will have to make repairs in the days that follow.","801023":"<b>A traumatic escape.</b> In the hurry to leave, your ship is spun broadside and exposed to gunfire. There are injuries, but none so deep as the sight of the dead boy's accomplice below. He weeps, and clutches one of the idols - a good luck charm.","801025":"Dockyard Dupe","801026":"<b>Robbed!</b> Thanking the generous innkeeper, your ship is ready to leave. Everyone at the dock smiles and waves you off, and no wonder, valuable equipment is later discovered to be missing. You must decide now if it's worth going back for.","801027":"Have the detective investigate","801028":"Return and plunder the Harbour","801029":"Return disguised and bait the robbers","801030":"Ask the local authorities to take action","801031":"Take the loss on the chin","801032":"<b>The detective already knows.</b> 'I was waiting to see if our crew were complicit, but am satisfied they are not.' Your ship returns and lays a watertight case before the local authorities. With the guilty arrested your equipment is returned and your ship fully resupplied gratis.","801033":"<b>Swift justice.</b> Petty defences crumble in the dawn light. Your ship yawns unopposed into the smouldering harbour, and turns its guns upon the harbourmaster's office. 'Please, take anything!' he yelps.","801034":"<b>Your assault is too slow.</b> As you gain the upper hand over the harbour defences, the cavalry appear. Cannons pop from the west; local authorities come as reinforcement.","801035":"<b>An absolute shambles.</b> Couldn't even best a few locals and their primitive demi-cannon. 'What shall defeat us next?' yelp those who are not killed by the blast, 'A small, but angry gang of tortoises?'","801036":"Fight them all","801037":"<b>You put an end to corruption!</b> Brought to their knees, the local authorities admit a conspiracy in which all are involved. 'It was never meant to go this far. We vow our people shall never rob again!' Proud to have effected change, you take back your possessions and leave.","801038":"<b>The enemy force is vast.</b> 'How many are there, captain!? We must turn back.' But it is too late. Soon it is not just the western cliff lit up with cannonfire, but your ship. Many lives will be lost before you crawl out of range.","801039":"Make peace, and reason with the officials.","801040":"<b>They are wiling to listen.</b> After an exasperating few days, you are finally able to prove your losses. The authorities take in the guilty dockers, and most, but not all of your possessions are returned.","801041":"<b>The authorities stand with their own.</b> You put your case as best you can, but it's not enough. Furthermore, you must answer for the damage you've caused. Unfortunately, this means leaving one of your best behind to help with repairs.","801042":"<b>You rumble the schemers!</b> The crew set aside superstition, daubing your ship a new name. Cut-throat sailors pose as officers, with cabin curtains repurposed as sashes to mark them strangely. Taken in by it all, the innkeeper and his dockside associates are caught in the act. You make sure to relieve them of far more than they stole.","801043":"<b>It works, at first.</b> A lick of paint, and the ship differs enough to blend in at the busy port. Moustaches and clothes aren't enough for the crafty innkeeper though. 'Thought you could fool us?' he scoffs.","801044":"<b>With feeble disguises</b>, your party can't believe the inn doesn't out them. But then there's laughter, as patrons turn in unison, guns held to your heads. 'Better hope its not cold where you go!' the innkeeper says. Your crew are stripped, bound, and packed off to sea.","801045":"Take back what is yours by force","801046":"Threaten to expose their scheme","801047":"<b>Sometimes a fistfight is the only way.</b> The inn is a hurricane of chair and glass, as your crew express themselves the only way they know how. Once the locals are subdued, the innkeeper is dragged outside, his life now security against whatever plunder you please.","801048":"<b>The locals are brutal.</b> Home-made knuckles, knives and cudgels scrape open the faces of your crew. Some are to bleed out on the sticky hostelry floor, the bloody remainder, to be packed off by the authorities for disturbance of the peace.","801049":"<b>The innkeeper relents.</b> 'We've got a good thing going here, and I don't want you spoiling it,' he sniffs, 'take what's yours and leave.' The crew have back what they lost, but thoughts are spared for the scheme's next unwary victims.","801050":"<b>'Get out, before we scratch you out!'</b> growls the innkeeper, true colours plain. It seems the whole port is on his side. The expedition must take the loss of time and equipment on the chin.","801051":"<b>You make the case well.</b> 'You are quite right. Terrible corruption such as this must be put to an end!' says the governor, 'you shall have back what was taken.' His disingenuousness stinks to high heaven, but there's no time for deeper digging.","801052":"<b>They are corrupt.</b> 'What a fantastical story. I am so glad our country has fired your imagination!' smiles the governor.","801053":"Risk implicating the governor","801054":"Resort to violence","801055":"<b>'Clever. Very clever.'</b> He lights a cigar. 'How did you know the innkeeper was my brother?' Your emissary sensibly avoids the truth that it was guesswork. 'Take whatever you want,' he says gesturing to a warehouse bursting with seized goods.","801056":"<b>'That was your last mistake,'</b> chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest these fops!' Your delegation try to resist, but they are armed only with the toothpicks that came with their canapes. Your expedition must manage without them.","801057":"<b>'Alright, alright!'</b> says the amused governor, bayonet to his neck, 'take what you want. But then you leave.' Since the harbour is now well-guarded, you've done well to force a compromise.","801058":"<b>'That was a mistake,'</b> chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest them!' Your crew would rather die than be locked-up for life, so they fight their way out. At least, one or two of them do.","801059":"Give up and leave","801060":"<b>Widespread frustration among the crew.</b> 'The instruments were vital for my research!', 'You let those beggars off scot free?!', 'This expedition is an embarrassment!' Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.","801061":"<b>Widespread frustration among the crew.</b> 'The instruments were vital for my research!', 'You let those beggars off scot free?!', 'This expedition is an embarrassment!' Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.","801063":"The Arid Basin","801064":"<b>Water has dribbled almost to nothing during an inland survey</b>, en route to the rendezvous. But hope springs eternal! A muddy river strikes through the arid basin. The crew are delirious when they realise it is not completely dried-up. Do you stop for water, or press on?","801065":"Trust the Botanist's expertise.","801066":"Fashion a device to extract water from mud.","801067":"Look for the source of the river","801068":"Press on to the rendezvous","801069":"<b>The botanist foams at the mouth with thirst-quenching theories.</b> 'The best idea may be these trees. Cut them just here, and catch the drip of water beneath,' they say, as they take a knife to the bark. Before an hour has passed, there's enough water to soothe a beached humpback.","801070":"<b>'The secret is boiling the water'</b>, says one resourceful survivalist, 'and needless to say a mixture of charcoal, sand and cloth makes a fine filter.' With water drawn, filtered and boiled, the crew can be sure it is safe to drink. Time even for a mud bath - your safari brigade slopping about like happy hippo.","801071":"<b>The water still has a mighty pong</b>, despite all solids having been separated out by the rudimentary device. Several feel terribly ill after drinking. A treatment can be improvised, or the survey can try to hold out until the rendezvous.","801072":"<b>Hours under hot sun, for fatally little.</b> Countless designs in the soil, and no prototype. When something is finally cobbled together, the fools test their stupid sieve with the last of the clean supply. It will be a miracle now if anyone survives.","801073":"<b>Finding a river source is easy</b>, but turning it into a shortcut...? That takes brains. High above the dry basin, water piles blissfully into the gully. The men wouldn't miss a swim beneath a waterfall for the world!","801074":"<b>There's water, if you can get to it.</b> Hippos are gathered all along the bank. This is their territory. If you don't refill here, there's no guarantee you'll find water further on.","801075":"<b>Following a river should have been easy.</b> But your party are so focused on distant goals, they fail to look immediately ahead. Suddenly, a man shoots downward as if yanked by giant hands. There are holes everywhere - an underground system of caves, and a tomb for your unlucky crew.","801076":"<b>There was never enough water for all of them.</b> A freak mist has the crew licking air with cracked tongues, but nothing can keep the wolf from the door. Several drop dead as old bone, before the safari staggers to the rendezvous camp.","801077":"Improvise a treatment","801078":"Hurry to the rendezvous","801079":"<b>The sickness clears over time.</b> 'With dysentery the patient must rest,' the sensible doctor said, 'away from the others.' With the last of the good water, and gentle nursing, the caravan reaches the rendezvous in fair health.","801080":"<b>No-one is ready for dysentery.</b> The sick are empty and weak, no fluids to replenish all they have lost. With only vague measures in place to prevent the spread, savannah delirium reigns. The survey never reaches the rendezvous.","801081":"<b>Haste saves some, but not all.</b> Dysentery is thoroughly set in by the time the survey makes the rendezvous. Although the camp provides the sick every comfort, for many the rigours of the sickness prove too much.","801082":"Scare the hippos away","801083":"Approach the water cautiously","801084":"Shoot at the hippos","801085":"Wait for nightfall, hoping they leave","801086":"Back off and try something else","801087":"<b>Hip hip hooray!</b> The hippos run as fast as their stout legs will carry them. The serenity of the river bank is utterly destroyed, but none of your crew care, as they help themselves to bucketfuls of clean and highly quaffable drinking water.","801088":"<b>Someone knows their hippopotami.</b> A kinship with the animals allows the gentle river bank to be shared. Fresh water is relayed by the bucket. A few nervous moments as a large female rears out of the water, but she just wants a bird to pick her teeth. Satisfied, the crew resume their trek to the rendezvous.","801089":"<b>There's movement in the hippo camp</b>, as the crew approach, followed by violent evacuations of their gigantic nostrils. Mandolin jaws open wide in display, and it is pretty clear to the crew they have no choice but to back off.","801090":"<b>A game of unhappy hippos ensues!</b> The water swirls with their pudgy bodies. They snort and scream, and prepare to charge.","801091":"Fire at the charging hippo","801092":"Immediately run away and leave the area entirely","801093":"<b>Cold, but effective.</b> The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead. The other hippos falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink.","801094":"<b>The hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.</b> One is dead on impact. Others die slow, trampled or drowning, matchstick guns floating downriver like poohsticks. There's almost no-one left to make the rendezvous.","801095":"<b>Escape is more panic than anything else</b>, but the crew are spooked. Lurching through the water with hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again.","801096":"<b>Aquatic combat is a key discipline.</b> What small guilt the crew feel about driving the poor hippos from their patch is overcome by a will to survive. Out here, it is such ruthlessness that separates the living from the dead.","801097":"<b>What shot hits, barely passes through blubber.</b> The whole bloat of hippos charge, leaving them an instant to make a decision.","801098":"Fire at the hippos","801099":"Run","801100":"<b>Cold, but effective.</b> The brigade focus fire at the closest hippo, and soon it is dead. The other hippo falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin.

Lurching through the water with hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again.","801103":"<b>Hardly seems worth waiting for.</b> The hippos wallow all evening, leaving only as night falls to graze. The crew have lost half a day's march on the rendezvous, for a bit of muddy water.","801104":"<b>A waste of time.</b> The hippos leave at dusk to graze. Unfortunately, their patch is just a stone's throw away. Their aqueous eyes can be seen glistening in the moonlight, and no-one wants to risk it.","801580":"You have found a radiant relic! The crew toast the success of your archaeological expedition. May we now better understand what it is to be human!","801587":"Sunken Depths","801588":"<b>Unusual debris float among the waves.</b> Mold-ridden planks of wood, strings of cloth, fragments of broken plaster, all tinted by the gray shade of time. Filled with childish excitation, the crew discusses the possibility of going underwater to uncover the debris' origin.","801589":"Send your diver into the depths","801590":"Improvise a diving bell","801591":"Ignore the beckoning junk","801592":"<b>The diver plunges into the ocean with fish-like ease.</b> He follows the trail of debris through the murky waters and almost smacks into a wall of indescribable height. Unsure whether the obstacle is natural or man-made, the diver wanders along its smooth facade until he finds an uncanny artefact and resurfaces with it. His account of the underwater mystery fascinates the crew.","801593":"<b>The diving bell looks decent and feels solid.</b> Two men climb aboard and the bell plunges into the depths while a whole group of sailors pumps air into its ventilation tube. The bell descends until it is stopped by a surface of coral. Underneath the colorful shapes, the sailors notice a silver coin on their left and a gaping, perfectly circular hole on their right.","801594":"<b>The homemade diving bell falls apart.</b> The engineers, specialized in complex ship machinery, have no idea on how to make such a simple device. Their machine departs with two men onboard, and they continue to dive while the bell itself stays afloat. When the divers emerge, the engineers take an earful and the crew is too disheartened to make a new attempt.","801595":"Hope that it will resist the dive and push the bell into the hole","801596":"Pick up the coin and resurface","801597":"<b>Their trust in the work of their comrades pays.</b> The bell slithers in a slow fall which allows the bewitched divers to take in the view. This is no sunken ship: the engraved hole was a window among a hundred more lining a hall of ridiculous proportions. A single ray of light, pouring from the hole, accompanies the bell's descent until it lands on what might have been statue alcoves. A shining green pearl lies in the lowest part of the alcove.","801598":"<b>The bell doesn't resist the fall.</b> Instead of gliding along the sides of the hole, the bell tilts, letting the water in. The men call for help and the crew immediately tries to pull them up, fighting against what rocks snare the bell, doing their best to save their mates, and unable to react when the rope snaps into their hands. They are left to mourn their sea-buried companions.","801599":"Ignore the pearl and risk the dive into darkness","801600":"Retrieve the pearl from the dead-end and resurface","801601":"<b>Call it luck or miracle, but the bell holds.</b> One of the men lights the bell's lamp and the other dives, following the glow as it illuminates the silent scene below: ghostly statues of hunting scenes, collapsed frescoes depicting plentiful gardens, and a massive throne of fractured marble on which a sword waits, covered in fluttering kelp. When the artifact is brought back to the surface and cleaned up, it reveals a weapon of exquisite quality, embedded with unknown jewels and metals.","801602":"<b>Lady Luck does not smile for the faithless.</b> As the bell descends into the dark, so does the pressure rise and press against the makeshift protection. The sailors pull the signal rope in a panic, but despite their fervent prayers, they are not pulled up in time. All that the crew manages to retrieve from the sea are the broken bell and its broken contents.","801603":"Sunken Depths","801604":"<b>Low risk, low reward.</b> The diving bell emerges without a scratch and the crew enjoys the tiny silver coin, passing it around and commenting on its singular aspect. Their excitement can only survive for so long and the coin is stored in the officers' coffers while the sailors whisper what ifs leading to grander treasures.","801605":"<b>The sailors protest but understand the risk.</b> As the ship goes on its way, its wake drowns the singular ruins and their promise of adventure.","801607":"The Trial","801609":"<b>The crew faces the bloody customs of foreign lands.</b> After a night of feasting, the sailors believe that meeting the foreign prince and his sea-traveling court is the highlight of their trip. However, morning comes with news of a sudden death among the court, and your crew is immediately accused of murder. The prince demands a trial by combat and your men are left with little freedom but the choice of the challenge's nature.","801610":"Send your strongest fighter for a brawl","801611":"Send your best shot for a pistol duel","801612":"Send your brightest officer for a trial of wits","801613":"<b>What could a lord do against a sea-forged champion?</b> The prince's warrior is nothing more than a scarecrow in shiny armor, and your own cotton-clad fighter scoffs at his tacky opponent. The walking wardrobe is tripped, grabbed, and thrown overboard in a single movement. As per foreign laws, your crew receives compensation and their name is cleared.","801614":"<b>No word is brutal enough to describe your opponent.</b> If his plate armor is scaled to match the man inside, then that man is a giant. The human mountain reaches to grab your fighter and crushes his skull like he would an apple. Word of your crew's feebleness and alleged crimes is sent for all cities to know and spread.","801615":"<b>Your gunslinger shoots faster than his own shadow.</b> His opponent drops to the ground before anyone can see or even understand that a gun has been fired, and only the banging sound and fuming barrel testify to the attack. The prince wonders how lucky your sharpshooter is, then reluctantly graces the crew and presents them with compensation for his offence.","801616":"<b>Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.</b> The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen. Your best shot is dead before he even touches the handle of his gun. Judging his passing to be too low a price, the prince randomly selects men among your crew and has them hanged for good measure.","801617":"<b>The foreigners are drawn in by your officer's pace.</b> He inspects the body, noticing knife cuts of varying depths and bleeding. Through methodical questioning, the officer presses the foreigners and reveals the deception: each wound was made by a different hand, the victim was killed by all of them! The prince buys the sailors' silence and they leave wondering what could have motivated the curious murder.","801618":"<b>A mute would have pleaded better.</b> The officer engages in a battle of arguments with the prince's vizier, and each of his meager claims are met with factual evidence of their contrary. The prince cuts the exchange with exasperation and has the officer taken to be quartered till torn apart as a final judgement for the supposed crime. No scream ever matches the ones heard that day.","801620":"Wall of Ice","801621":"<b>The ship has hit an iceberg!</b> Navigating in the dark proved to be folly: what little lighting the ship provides for itself does not compensate for the absence of moonlight. A low thud shakes the entire boat, and the swinging lights of night lanterns reveal the rampart-like block of ice they have run into. A crevice splits the iceberg and the ship is stuck inside.","801622":"Destroy the iceberg with dynamite","801623":"Bombard the ice with all cannons","801624":"Build a device to push the ice away","801625":"Pray for help","801626":"<b>No obstacle can prevail before human might.</b> Sticks of dynamite are tied to the iceberg's flanks and lit in a perfect synchrony, exploding in a tidy and devastatingly efficient manner. Impressed by their own skill, the crew happily resumes the trip.","801627":"<b>The iceberg crumbles under the impressive firepower of the ship.</b> The port and starboard cannons are fired, denting the ice inch by inch until it breaks into pieces which fall into the water with huge splashes. The ship's iron prow pushes against the formidable obstacle and breaks through under the cheers of the crew.","801628":"<b>Those puny cannons cannot take down the wall of ice.</b> Frozen shards rain on the deck with each new cannon blast, and they cut and slice into the sailors - tiny wounds which make it seem like the iceberg is fighting back. The crevice surrounding the ship has gotten bigger, but still refuses to let it go.","801629":"Climb the iceberg to plant explosives inside","801630":"The iceberg is weakened, wait for it to melt","801631":"<b>A risky reward for a risky attempt.</b> Using what nails and planks they can hammer into the wall of ice, a group of sailors climbs it and manages to reach its top, where they plant a barrel of gunpowder. The explosion lights the night, pulverizes the wall, and nicks the ship's hull. The vessel can leave after light repairs.","801632":"<b>Climbing does not simply consist of walking upwards.</b> The men slip, slide, shift and totter, and their best effort resides in climbing on each other's shoulders to try and reach new heights. They don't, and the human ladder crashes onto the deck, leaving all of its rungs bent or definitively broken. The remaining crew must wait for the ice to melt by itself before they can leave.","801633":"<b>Days melt into weeks which melt into months.</b> With each passing moment, the ice grows a bit weaker, but constant observation makes it seem like nothing is changing. The wait drives the crew restless and their tension escalates into regular, if unjustified, brawls. When the ice finally lets them go, all sailors have gained their small share of madness.","801634":"<b>The crew assembles a perfect lever to free the ship.</b> Unbolting the decorative guardrail of the prow and roping it to the starboard railing, they manage to create a semblance of a pry bar which sneaks between the hull and the ice and pushes the latter away. The sailors row their way out to the cadence of a beloved song.","801635":"<b>There is a difference between imagining and actually creating.</b> The lever mechanism devised by the engineers is as unmanageable as it is ugly and the shape of the thing, which defies the very concept of aesthetics, is a testimony to its chaotic behaviour. The crew gives up any idea of building their own escape device.","801636":"<b>Patience and good faith reward the sailors' prayers.</b> The following day is devoid of clouds or wind and the perfect weather attracts fishing boats to deeper seas. The stuck ship is seen and rescued right away. The navigators hasten to warn their fellow seamen of the danger and are even offered a space in the prestigious Practical Pilot navigation guide. Such an accident will never happen again!","801637":"<b>Prayers take a long time to reach whoever is listening.</b> The crew waits, digging into their supplies and entertaining themselves however they can. Rescue finally comes after one full week in the form of a whaler which drags the ship out from its ice prison, and the sailors, relieved but tired, can't help but wonder if they could have made it out on their own.","801638":"<b>Nobody is answering these prayers.</b> After days of idling in the cold and gnawing through their supplies and patience, the crew's discontent rises to the extent that they cannot bear to wait any longer. If help does come, it will come from themselves.","801642":"Scylla and Charybdis","801643":"<b>Your crew attempts the crossing of a vicious strait.</b> Like Odysseus along the coasts of Sicily, they see a subsidiary current running counter to the main flow, its strength so wild it brings fish with deformed eyes and luminescent bellies to the surface. What creatures are not swallowed by this whirlpool end up impaled on the shore's nasty teeth.","801646":"Avoid the whirlpool and maneuver to dodge the shore","801647":"Avoid the shore and hope the whirlpool won't suck the ship in","801648":"<b>Odysseus didn't have the ability of your navigators.</b> Through a series of tight maneuvers and expert understanding of the furious currents, they drive the ship between the whirlpool and the shore, using the provided momentum to dash ahead. The moment is a brief as it is intense and the crew rejoices, laughing like children under the cold droplets of crashing waves.","801649":"<b>The maneuver is even more complicated than expected.</b> The ship is driven alongside the whirlpool and flirts with the shore, the racket of the water covering the orders shouted by officers. The current speeds up, inexorably pulling the ship towards the reef.","801650":"<b>Fear clouds the navigators' readings.</b> Unable to choose between several possible courses which could all end in disaster, they opt for a stunned silence and let the crew maneuver on their own. The ship crashes on the shore in an explosion of metal and wood which sends a dozen men overboard and straight into the rock fangs of the coast. It is more a wreck than a ship which escapes the deadly strait.","801651":"Spin the ship to take the damage on its flank","801652":"Bombard the shore in an attempt to slow the ship","801653":"<b>A frontal crash is avoided, but it is a crash nonetheless.</b> The whole ship protests against the unnatural movement, its rudder straining against the current and its hull complaining loudly against the maneuver until the impact silences it. The repairs are much lighter than they could have been.","801654":"<b>Your navigators cannot control the wild ship.</b> The maneuver sends it spinning and it plunges into the reef prow first. If it weren't for the metal cast protecting the vessel, the crew would have been crushed as well. The repairs, which take place both in the swirling waters and on the knife-like rocks, are excruciating.","801655":"<b>Power faces power in a risky but successful attempt.</b> All cannons are fired in the shore's direction, in a surprisingly efficient effort to slow the ship down. The ship lands on the devastated coast and the hull is barely grated by the remains of the broken stone spears.","801656":"<b>What did they expect, attacking nature itself?</b> The massive teeth of stone barely tremble under the cannon's fire, and the recoil is a futile strength against the voracious current. The rock jaw catches the ship and grinds the upper deck, sending several sailors to be served as the strait's daily food.","801657":"<b>The sailors' fright gives them wings.</b> The crew reacts to each order with unparalleled speed, too occupied to plead the heavens to think of discussing the risky manoeuvres that are asked of them. When at last the whirlpool is passed, their belief that the Almighty might have his eyes on this ship is stronger than ever.","801658":"<b>There are only so many disasters faith can prevent.</b> When they understand that the whirlpool is a monster none should face, the sailors fall to their knees to pray and beg, abandoning what meaningless impact they could have had on the ship's trajectory. Like Circe prophesied to Odysseus, the currents attack the ship, the men, and a hero.","801660":"Uncategorised","801662":"Expedition Morale Medium","801663":"Expedition Morale High","801664":"The Chasing","801665":"Through the canons heavy smoke, the lookout sees a Pyrphorian gunboat sailing away and disappearing in the distance.

In panic, he explains that his whole group was slaugthered. He was lucky enough to escape and managed to follow the murderers until he found the Pyrphorians' hide, a big house outside the city. A crew is assembled at once to go there. <br /> The house and its grand French garden around it is seeable from the street but is surrounded by a high fence with two guards at the gate.

A good dozen of men is needed to make it work, but they buy enough time for proper repairs.","802008":"<b>This joke of a pump looks like it came from the Dark Ages.</b> As the sailors battle to have their own idea of a pump prevail over the others, they assemble a monster that does nothing more than blow bubbles. One of the cracks bursts in a spray of water that silences the machine and starts flooding the hull.","802010":"Seal the overflowing section, regardless of what or who might still be inside","802011":"Make a decision, who knows what happens if you don't!","802012":"<b>The ship rises over the water, but at what cost?</b> Sailors watch their supplies drift away from the vessel, their hearts lingering after the lost items until the officers remind them of the emergency of repairs.","802013":"<b>There's nothing to be done.</b> The ship slowly sinks, pulled into the water with each new fracture in its hull.

However, there is no avoiding reopening the hull when time comes for repairs: the water flows out, carrying bodies transfixed in expressions of suffocation, terror, and betrayal.","802015":"<b>The drown cargo cannot be salvaged.</b> When the ship finally finds a harbour, its hull is so low under the waterline your crew fears the boat will sink. Although such fears are unfounded, the leakage drowned a good part of their stored food, and the repairs feel like they should have be done much earlier.","802016":"Throw supplies overboard to try and bring the crack over the waterline","802017":"Okay","802018":"Cancel","802020":"The Trial","802021":"<b>These hoodlums are asking for it.</b> To each harbour its own ill-famed tavern, and this one is no exception. While your crew enjoys a beer at the counter, the tavern's door slams open, the bartender stiffens and the volume of conversations dwindles: the newcomers are regulars of the bad kind.

With a roar, the other thugs pounce on your sailors who greet them with jabs to the chin and sternum, downing the attackers with no more than two hits per man - the seconds for the pleasure of good fighting form. The tavern applauds the action and the bartender offers a round to celebrate the deserved beating.","802026":"<b>The crew overestimated themselves.</b> As he calls for the other sailors to help, the doctor gets his head smashed into the counter. His crewmates scream for revenge and look like toddlers agitating their little arms to try and hit the big bad guys. The thugs are not in the mood to play along, and one of them stabs a bawling sailor in the liver to make them shut up. They slowly die as the thugs depart, leaving the tavern in a stupor.","802027":"<b>The language of alcohol is universal.</b> The thugs take you up on your offer and eye the sailors' purses as they pass the money around to pay for the beers. As the first round arrives, one of the hoodlums speaks up and announces that they will have a drinking contest with the crew. The idea is one-sided and weirdly different from their previous aggressive attitude.","802028":"<b>Bribing them with alcohol doesn't seem to work.</b> Your crew invites the men to sit and share a beer, on them, to try and bring the tension down. The thug doesn't let go of the doctor and points at the aligned liquors behind the bartender. A glass of all of these, he says, and a bottle of your best whatever. That's way more than they can drink and way more than your sailors can afford.","802029":"Show them the drinking ability of seafarers","802030":"Drug their drinks to avoid the confrontation","802031":"<b>They call that catpiss strong?</b> There's no question regarding who wins the drinking contest: your crew is still standing and enjoying the beers long after the thugs have hit the ground, curled into whatever their stomach rejected. The pungent smell of vomit and cheap ale does not deter the sailors, who casually finish their steins, pay for them, and drag the hoodlums to the closest man of law.","802032":"<b>What kind of liquid fire do they make this with?</b> The crew is used to strong drinks and exotic ales, but the tavern's special mixture of bourbon, sugar and Ricard is way past what they can handle. The thugs are accustomed to this local horror and barely wobble while your sailors pass out one after the other. When they wake up, obviously, their purses are missing.","802033":"<b>War anaesthetics are remarkably useful against small-time thugs.</b> After a few rounds spent boasting their virile resistance to any kind of liquor, the crew notices the drop in attention of their opponents and their doctor seizes the opportunity, lacing the incoming mugs with just the right dosage of chloroform. The snoring hoodlums are delivered to the local authorities, who enjoy the unexpected present.","802034":"<b>The dosage doesn't put the thugs to sleep: it kills them.</b> The doctor sidles among the thugs, lacing their drinks and snickering in expectation. Soon the effects appear: the gang shows drowsiness, then nausea, loses control of their movements and tumbles against the counter, their faces taking on a waxy yellow color. The crew can do nothing as the hoodlums break into seizures and foam at the mouth. They win the drinking contest by default, murderers of their opponents.","802035":"If it's a fight they want, they'll get one","802036":"Pay up","802037":"<b>The crew is humiliated.</b> They empty their purses trying to pay for the excessive demands of the thugs. Ale. Stew. Liquors. Meats. When sunrise pushes the hoodlums to leave the tavern, the sailors are stuck with cooking, dishwashing and dust-wiping until the bartender considers their debt paid.","802038":"<b>Your sailors apologize through gritted teeth.</b> Pleased by their groveling, the thugs do not pester them anymore, yet the heavy stares of the other clients push your crew to leave the tavern.

Both agree on working to reach a better balance of power and supply repartition within the crew, and they leave satisfied with the encounter. A fair outcome for everyone.","802047":"<b>The discussion reaches an end, somehow.</b> The first mate doesn't listen to the chaplain and the chaplain doesn't hear the first mate. Their to-ing and fro-ing is exasperating even to their own allies. After an endless debate over meaningless details, the two men seem to reach an agreement and shake on it, ending the hostilities. In truth, the established innovations are nothing more than old measures with new faces: novelty, not change.","802048":"<b>There is no trust to be found in the rebel's hearts.</b> The chaplain refuses to meet your first lieutenant on the deck and invites him to join him in his own quarters instead: in short, in hostile territory.","802049":"Negotiate with the chaplain in his quarters","802050":"That's enough disobedience, arrest the chaplain","802051":"<b>The lieutenant manages to reason with the chaplain.</b> The officer comes to the ringleaders' quarters unarmed, and stands his ground while surrounded by nothing but hostile faces. He call to the faith of the chaplain and argues for a slow if deep change in the ship's line of command, offering his own position to the chaplain as long as he his kept as a close advisor. His stepping down is discouraging for the loyalists, but it was the only available option at this point.","802052":"<b>The meeting goes nowhere.</b> With each new compromise offered by the first lieutenant the chaplain adds an additional request, growing more and more assured of his dominance in the current stalemate. The officer leaves with a list of impossible demands and the ringleader's followers stop working altogether. The ship comes to a stop, waiting for a decision to be made.","802053":"<b>The discussion is one-sided and disastrous.</b> The first lieutenant barges in the chaplain's quarters and belches a series of commands, menacing the ringleader and his men of flogging, hanging, marooning and flogging again. The loyalists feel ashamed of following such a disrespectful idiot. Under the cover of the night, when the chaplain and his followers steal a long boat to desert the unbearable rule of the officers, many sailors follow. Less than half of the original crew remains.","802054":"Be subtle, send the chaplain poisoned wine","802055":"Be clear, arrest the chaplain for high treason","802056":"Be ambiguous, ignore the chaplain's demands","802057":"<b>A swift and efficient assassination.</b> Convinced of his advantage in the current situation, the chaplain gracefully accepts the first lieutenant's wine. The poison does not act immediately, but its effect is unequivocal: at dawn, the chaplain is bent over his desk, wide-eyed and grey as dust. No sailor dares to mention the reason for his death. Their caution enforces discipline, fear of their officers, and a general distrust of alcohol.","802058":"<b>The poison is obvious.</b> The wine reeks, its smell so deadly and its color so murky it might as well have a skull and bones drawn on its label. The chaplain forces the lieutenant's envoy to drink the whole mixture. As the poor girl quivers and coughs blood and bile, the ringleader and his followers leave their quarters - by the time the envoy is dead, they are standing before the first lieutenant's cabin, armed and set on killing.","802059":"In a final attempt at peaceful resolution, offer a bribe","802060":"There is no choice but to confront them","802061":"This will be costly.","802062":"Okay","802063":"Cancel","802064":"<b>The bribe is enough, but its price goes beyond monetary value.</b> The chaplain's despise for the first lieutenant spreads to the crew as they learn of the murder attempt, and the mob of sailors lock their officers in their cabins to stay there until the end of the trip. That they were not killed is the only victory the officers can enjoy.","802065":"<b>True anger can only be quelled with bribes of blood.</b> The chaplain ignores the first lieutenant's plea. The man of faith pulls a rosary from his wrist, gestures for his men to act, and prays. With each bead which passes under his fingers a rebel plants his sword into the lieutenant, and as the officer screams so does the chaplain chants, louder and louder, until the prayer stops. When they leave the cabin, a new and mad order is established on the ship.","802066":"<b>Reinforcements come running at the lieutenant's call.</b> The chaplain and his followers are surrounded and swiftly defeated, their strength no match for the loyalists' military training and devotion to their officers. Order is reinstated, the loyalists turned into a militia which reigns over the other sailors and suppresses any attempt at questioning the working conditions and power dynamics on the ship.","802067":"<b>The loyalists are less prepared, less convinced, and more brittle.</b> The rebels break them, destroying what few sailors still tried to uphold discipline on the ship. The chaplain has the survivors attached to the mainmast and forced to drink poison, letting their corpses rot where they stand - a display which warns all sailors against condemning his actions. The trip continues under the rule of the chaplain, with the crew convinced that they just replaced a tyrant with another.","802068":"<b>The man of faith is captured and executed.</b> The loyalists storm the chaplain's quarters and seize him before his followers can react - men used to fight with words can do little in the face of physical oppression. The chaplain is judged on the deck for all to see and hear, accused of high treason, then hanged on the mainmast and left to rot for a week. Fear keeps the sailors in check for the rest of the trip.","802069":"<b>The arrest is a bloodbath.</b> If the loyalists had had an advantage in discipline or numbers, the arrest could have been quick. However, the whole crew enters the melee, sailors hitting each other blindly, unsure which side they're attacking and which they belong to. The chaplain is dragged across the deck and hanged without trial: a display of gratuitous violence which brings the sailors back to their senses. The body of the man of faith oscillates in the wind, shredded and limp, mirroring the crew.","802070":"<b>Inaction is not what the sailors hoped for.</b> Both loyalists and rebels are dismayed by the absence of decision and restlessness spreads through the crew until the tension finally explodes: the first lieutenant is found dead in his quarters. The defiant act is not punished and most sailors interpret it as yet another sign of weakness, while others argue that the murder was judgment in and of itself.","802071":"<b>The loyalists' strength dwindles when facing friends.</b> Loyalists and troublemakers collide in a short and feeble brawl, each side unable to give up or to kill their former crewmates. Shots willingly miss, slashes willingly fumble, punches willingly go limp. The fight goes out without a clear victor, and the rest of the trip is spent with both side wary of each other.","802072":"<b>The loyalists are too weak.</b> The conflict erupts into an exchange of slurs, then blows, then gunshots. Men and women frantically try to kill sailors who were good friends and both first lieutenant and chaplain are no exceptions: the ring leader unexpectedly draw a sword and both men impale each other, their deaths signaling the end of the senseless fight. The crew collects its thoughts to mourn the man of Church for the efforts he put in for them.","802073":"The chaplain looks expectantly.","802074":"Okay","802075":"Cancel","802076":"<b>A pragmatic solution.</b> The amount offered to the chaplain to buy his obedience is enough for the man of faith to ignore the incongruity of the monetary negotiations. With the roots of their problem still present the crew remains unruly, but the bought leader makes sure to maintain their anger at the lowest levels.","802077":"<b>The offer does not match the chaplain's expectations.</b> If his calmness is to be bought, the price should be enough for him to share with all the sailors he roused. The offended man of faith retreats to his quarters without a word.","802078":"<b>The budding mutiny is easily crushed.</b> The first lieutenant and two loyalists are all it takes to seize the chaplain and drag him to judgement: the man is condemned to be marooned on the next deserted island they find, and left to die at will or live in solitude. The swift arrest and punishment impresses the rest of the crew and renews their respect for their officers.","802079":"<b>The loyalists' strength dwindles when facing friends.</b> Loyalists and troublemakers collide in a short and feeble brawl, each side unable to give up or to kill their former crewmates.

For a moment the ropes tying it to the other masts hold it in place, but there is only so much weight they can take: they break with a snap, letting the mizzenmast plummet on the deck. A sailor now wails, his leg caught under a pole twice his size.","802085":"Cover the leg with a mix of water and soap and pull it away","802086":"Cut the leg with a bone saw","802087":"Lift the mast with a makeshift lever","802088":"<b>The sailor is easily pulled from under the mast.</b> The foamy water allows the crushed leg to slither away from the debris and the limb emerges covered in rainbow bubbles and bloody splinters. The man will live and maybe, with a miracle or two, his leg will mend.","802089":"<b>An extreme but recommendable choice.</b> The sailor is given rum to drink and cloth to bite before he is held in place, his leg bound with a tight tourniquet. The doctor's labour is gruesome and the man can feel the grinding cuts as they tear through him, and he screams through the cloth and he howls and he roars - and yet the doctor stays composed and focused. When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels that they are in capable hands.","802090":"<b>Butchery.</b> The doctor's hands tremble more than his victim does, and the saw draws zigzags in the flesh, each cut unable to connect with the previous ones. The trapped sailor's screams become whimpers, then silence. The doctor has to be stopped before he can ruin any more of the unfortunate corpse, and his blood-clad figure sends a warning to whoever might ever need his help in the future.","802091":"<b>The man is freed.</b> Using one of the partners broken by the mast, the crew fits the sturdy pieces of timber between the deck and the fallen mast, adding plank after plank in the opening and gradually raising the mast with ropes and pulleys tied to the mainmast. They manage to lift the mast long enough to free the sailor, and the doctor immediately tends to his crushed leg.","802092":"<b>The vague idea of a lever never becomes real.</b> The sailors try to lift the mizzenmast by rolling logs underneath, but the huge wooden pole is far too heavy for its rolling movement to be controlled. The mast lurches forward and rolls from the sailor's leg to his chest, pushing his insides out. The view stays with the sailors for days before they can finally reach a decent harbour, get rid of the broken mast, and clean up the grisly mess underneath.","802094":"Sea Still","802095":"<b>Tangled!</b> The Sargasso Sea was made famous by Columbus' sailors and their fear of entrapment: indeed, the vast surfaces of algae that stretch above the diamond waters look ominous, and their menace is confirmed by the ship standing still in their midst. Your own vessel avoids the brown plants, when a call rings from the stuck ship. There are still sailors onboard! You have no proper rescue equipment and risk getting tangled - should you try to help?","802096":"A steam ship fears no entanglement - go rescue them!","802097":"Help from a distance and fire a roped harpoon at their ship","802098":"Do not take any risk and leave","802099":"Your steam ship rides through the algae as if it was nothing. In fact, it is. The algae parts before your ship from the sole movement of the waves. Your sailors stay stunned as they see the legend break before them, and the rescued crew reveal their truth: it was the dreadfully calm winds of the Sargasso sea that caught their ship, not the flimsy algae. The saved sailors happily join your own and marvel at the steam ship's independence from the winds.","802100":"<b>A perfect shot.</b> With just the right dosage of propulsion strength and aiming power, the harpoon strikes the stranded ship's starboard without damaging too much of its hull. The rope is collected by the crew onboard and they bind it to their railings before waiting for your instructions.","802101":"<b>Harpooning a ship without sinking it requires skills you crew doesn't have.</b> The harpoon crashes into the stranded vessel and breaks through its starboard, allowing water to gush inside. Panicked screams emerge from the ship as several sailors jump into the water's algae in a desperate attempt to save themselves.","802102":"Tie a buoy to the improvised zip line and create a transportation device","802103":"Encourage the sailors to climb the rope and cross the distance on their own","802104":"<b>A flawless breeches buoy.</b> The buoy is tied with ropes and cloth to create a solid leg harness, allowing the stranded sailors to be pulled to your ship in an almost comfortable manner. Once freed of the algae embarked on their clothes, the rescued crew eagerly offer their services to repay their life debt.","802105":"<b>The buoy comes undone with the first rescue attempt.</b> As soon as a sailor climbs onto the contraption, it slips and swirls and sends him into the water. The ripples part the algae, revealing how meek the obstacle was: it was the still winds, not the plants, which prevented the ship from moving. The crews from both ships watch helplessly as the man drowns in the clear waters, before resuming their rescue in gloom and shame.","802106":"<b>A surge of courage animates the stranded sailors.</b> Under the cheers of your crew and the repeated encouragements of your lieutenants, they grab the rope and, with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Their miraculous rescue leaves them stronger and confident in both their skills and your crew's good will - they join your sailors without a second thought.","802107":"<b>Hope alone cannot give them strength.</b> Encouraged by your crew, one of the sailors of the stuck ship takes hold of the rope and suspends himself, legs crossed and hands gripping the hemp. As he begins his travel the coarse fibbers nibble his skin and the blood rushes to his head. He grabs a new handful of rope, fails, slips, falls. If he manages to climb back onboard, no other volunteer wishes to attempt the crossing, and you have to leave without a single sailor rescued.","802108":"Send strong sailors with buoys to rescue them","802109":"You will not risk sharing their entangled fate: leave","802110":"<b>The rescue is cruelly easy.</b> Your sailors plunge into the waters and see the algae part before them: there's no real obstacle here. They grab the stranded crew as it drifts to them and bring them back onboard, where the rescued men explain that it was the dead winds which forced their ship to stay still. Their thankfulness is barely enough to erase your wasted efforts and the shame of your crew.","802111":"<b>The rescue is a failure.</b> Your sailors push each other, trying to swim while pulling the huge buoys, and they paddle like young dogs discovering their first waters. They are exhausted way before they can reach the stranded ship, and they turn around despite your crew's encouragements and the lieutenants' orders. There is no ignoring the curses of the drowning sailors as your ship sails away.","802112":"<b>We did what we could.</b> Fully aware that your crew's attempt did nothing but worsen the stranded sailors' fate, your lieutenants attempt a speech to lighten their burden. The sailors pretend to cheer up, but the thought of the abandoned ship stays with them.","802113":"<b>Someone better equipped might come their way.</b> Or we will call for help at the next harbour. Or this could be a trap. Or we didn't really hear a call. Excuses after excuses are discussed this night, and none sounds true enough for the sailors' hearts to be at peace.","802115":"Lava Maze","802116":"<b>Tremors, ash rain, light during night: it's an eruption!</b> The island was too lush and bountiful to be harmless. The lava responsible for the fertile ground creeps from the mouth of the waking volcano and towards the jungle where a party of your men had erected camp for the night.","802117":"Go back to the ship despite the darkness","802118":"Find shelter against the incoming lava","802119":"<b>The ship is quickly found.</b> The burning lights of the volcano illuminate the jungle and a handful of seasoned explorers lead the rest of the sailors back to the ship, zigzagging between shadows and fleeing animals. The vessel departs as the island is engulfed in flames, a vision as terrible as it is magnificent.","802120":"<b>The sailors are swallowed by the jungle's maze.</b> Dense trees, moving shadows, screeching animals and the crew itself, whose silhouettes are deformed by the scorching heat. Too many visions allow panic to spread among the men, who cannot recognize the path and never make it back to the ship.","802121":"<b>Shelter!</b> The crew finds a decrepit stone chapel, remains of a colonialist power, and deems it a better refuge than their cloth-made tents. An officer estimates that the lava will be on them soon: there's no choice but to spend the night here.","802122":"<b>Your crew is lost and perplexed.</b> Your most committed explorers cannot wrap their heads around the complexity of the jungle, which changes with every new burnt tree, and it seems that every uncovered path might end in lava-devoured dead ends.","802125":"Pray for the chapel to hold","802126":"Dig trenches in the holy ground","802127":"<b>The chapel miraculously stands its ground.</b> Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nested on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.","802128":"<b>Their faith is nothing but hypocrisy in need.</b> The crew remembers old aves from their worshipping days, but the years have eroded both their memory and their beliefs. They can only watch as the lava packs against the chapel's stained glass and breaks through. The spray of molten stone and broken glass scars all of them but kills none: a bite to remind them of their lack of dedication.","802129":"<b>The trenches are dug with military efficiency.</b> Despite the darkness and the imminent danger, the sailors manage to dig deep trenches in no time and the pits redirect the lava as it flows in. The sailors snuggle in the chapel while lava runs around them, illuminating the stained glass, and they rejoice in the warm comfort of their shelter.","802130":"<b>Too much pressure and too little grit.</b> The sailors can dig little more than scattered and knee-deep pits which have a negligible impact on the lava's course. As the crew scurries inside the chapel, so does the lava enters the sacred place and hugs the walls, its smoke burning throats and forever robbing the men of their voices.","802131":"Follow a random animal and trust its instincts","802132":"Pick a random path and trust your instincts","802133":"<b>All animals run to the beach, and your crew follows.</b> Tracking down the herd of squealing, screeching, shrilling critters could be done with eyes closed and the sailors are led to the shore where they had beached. The ship departs in a hurry, leaving the animals to die into the ruthless volcano fire.","802134":"<b>Your hunters find no pattern in the animals' frenzy.</b> The sailors run in a display of panic and poor judgment, mimicking the animals' despaired behavior. The crew still on the ship can only watch in horror as the island's greatest predator burns all preys, be they beast or human.","802135":"<b>Fear is the most reliable instinct.</b> The sailors scamper through the jungle, chasing after their lava-created shadows. They stumble upon the beach by pure miracle and hop on the ship with the molten tongues on their heels, and the ship departs with a slightly charred hull but a safe crew.","802136":"<b>Fear is a treacherous adviser.</b> Seeing that the only unburnt path is up, the sailors climb the jungle's trees in an attempt to escape the lava flow. Ground, then bark, then branches, then humans: everything burns. In the distance, the ship's remaining crew stay transfixed as they witness the volcano island devouring itself.","802138":"Selfless Deeds","802139":"<b>\"They steal your children?\"</b> The air hangs heavy around the sailors as their question withers in the hut. Their hosts consider the explorers, half-hopeful, half-eaten with the certitude that non-paying jobs are not the ones your crew enjoys. One child has to be offered with each new moon, an elder explains as she gestures towards the nearby river, or else bandits raid the surrounding settlements. Tomorrow, the bandits' steamboat will come to claim this village's due.","802140":"Board the bandits' steamer with your gunboat","802141":"Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff","802142":"Stay on your ship and deploy fire when the steamboat appears","802143":"Ignore the bandits and go on your way","802144":"<b>Your assault is swift and without a single casualty.</b> The kidnappers oppose no resistance when their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout, a sweatshop with no other employees than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exulting parents: they give no rewards but smiles and tears, and your crew basks in this priceless payment.","802145":"<b>Your crew navigates through the mangrove with aplomb.</b> The unusual environment doesn't manage to stop their steady rowing, and the sailors soon reach an outpost marking the entrance of the bandits' camp. Sobbing children are taken out of the kidnappers' steamboat and dragged towards a distant barn. Half a dozen armed men guard the building.","802146":"<b>The terrain is not one your crew is used to.</b> They get stuck in the mangrove roots and their swearing can be heard all the way to the coast. When they manage to get free, the bandits' steamboat is waiting, its railings lined with guns.","802147":"<b>Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.</b> The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate and they lose the bandits. They stumble upon both less and more than what they expected: a pit filled with torn shoes and their torn makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.","802148":"Attack the bandits before they reach the barn","802149":"Hide between the tree and wait for nightfall","802150":"<b>The bandits don't know what hit them.</b> Using the element of surprise to their advantage, your sailors break into the camp and stifle the children's escorts before they can call for help. They hush the kids and squat behind what few bushes offer protection, monitoring the other bandits. The attack wasn't noticed.","802151":"<b>The sailors are unfit for a swift assault.</b> Their choreographed clumsiness and dissonant roars drive the opponents back not because of their strength but because of the unconventional display. After an instant of bafflement, the kidnappers shout for others to join them and the whole gang soon surrounds your crew. They part to let their leader, a beast of a man, face the puny intruders.","802152":"Go all out on the bandits and save the remaining children","802153":"Acknowledge the danger and leave with what children are already saved","802154":"<b>Sailors and kids create a breathtaking chaos.</b> The crew shoots and skewers while the children kick and bite their former oppressors, calling others to do the same. A deluge of shrieking kids and young adults emerges from the barn and attacks the guards, thrilled by your crew's display of strength. The band of unlikely fighters seize the bandits' steamboat, help themselves to their supplies, and triumphantly returns to the coast.","802155":"<b>Audacity does not make up for their lack of numbers.</b> The crew manages to take down five guards before the noise attracts more armed bandits, and the sailors are driven back to their boat without a chance to liberate more children. The flee to the village and share what information they can with the villagers, glad to have freed some kids but aware that many more are still captive.","802156":"<b>The decision to run is not a simple one.</b> The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be and retreat to the village with the few children they have saved. They share what information they can with the villagers - maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, more planning... As the ship leaves the crew focuses on the good they did, rather than the deeds they could have done.","802157":"Fight the brute","802158":"Run away","802159":"<b>Your sailors' cause fuels their victory.</b> Driven by their will to save the children, your sailors do not waver in front of the bandits' leader, all muscles and swords and wild eyes. It takes six fighters to face the man, piling up on him in a torrent of dust and groans until he finally stops rampaging. Disheartened by this defeat and their leader's meaningless pride, the remaining kidnappers are brought to their knees and the children are freed. The crew returns to the village triumphant!","802160":"<b>The mastodon tramples your sailors.</b> The rescuers lack resistance and they are wiped by the bandits' leader, their corpses sent flying among the children who can do nothing but watch in horror. In a ultimate act of hatred, a young girl is sent back to her village to retell the carnage and warn future intruders against trying to rescue the children again.","802161":"<b>No sailor harmed, no child saved.</b> The crew manages to run back to the village, avoiding the multiple gunshots fired by the kidnappers. That no sailor was wounded is a miracle, but it pales when your rescue team comes back with no rescued child.","802162":"<b>The crew merges with the trees.</b> Unseen, unheard, the sailors bury themselves in the forest and observe their future targets. An opportunity arises when a group of bandits leave their posts to bathe in the river: splashing and talking, they do not hear your men approach.","802163":"<b>The sailors are not attuned to the notion of stealth.</b> They argue about the best place to hide and end up lining behind what could be the thinnest trees of the forest, their racket and bulging shapes attracting the undivided attention of the kidnapers. Their leader, more beast than man, advances to inspect the intruders and laughs at the puny men.","802164":"Steal their clothes to disguise as bandits","802165":"Capture the men to use them as hostages","802166":"<b>Your sailors in disguise orchestrate the children's escape.</b> Dressed with the bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn turned sweat shop where children are forced to work. One by one they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies: when the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunitions. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.","802167":"<b>The poorly-disguised intruders are identified and given chase.</b> When asked by an actual bandit about their shift, one of your undercover sailors tries to answer: they fumble and bumble until the bandit grabs them and shouts for intruders. They make a run for it with the others, leaving both kidnappers and children behind.","802168":"<b>A flawless action, from start to finish.</b> After a swift capture of the naked bandits, the sailors advance and discover the camp's true nature: a children-powered sweatshop. It is soon obvious that the bandits' leader is the only one who does not care for the hostages, and the man is forcibly exchanged by his crew against the promise that your sailors will never set foot here again. The rescuers come back with children on their shoulders, a culprit to be judged, and goods to be shared.","802169":"<b>The naked men overpower your fighters.</b> The element of surprise does not compensate the lacking strength of the crew, and they are easily repelled by the bathing bandits. Instead of killing them, the kidnappers order the sailors to strip and send them back as is, rescuers unable to retrieve the children and humiliated in the process.","802170":"Face the brute","802172":"<b>The crew is puny indeed, and it is butchered.</b> The bandits' leader needs no help to fight your rescuers, who spend more time trying to avoid being hit than actually fighting back. They flee the camp, scatter into the woods, and are hunted down like game. The few sailors who make it back to the coast can't even determinate the location of the kidnappers' camp, making the deaths of their companions pointless.","802173":"Bluff and pretend backup is on its way","802174":"Attempt to buy the children","802175":"Let them be and leave","802176":"<b>Your bluff works!</b> The kidnappers have a heated discussion before handing over what few children they have onboard, pressed by the menace your crew just invented. The sailors retreat to the village and deliver the kids, still amazed by their performance but upset they could save so little.","802177":"<b>They do not buy your bluff.</b> Holding your crew at gunpoint, the bandits casually wait for the reinforcements to show up. They don't. To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his tongue before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for liars. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.","802178":"The kidnappers smirk.","802179":"Okay","802180":"Cancel","802181":"<b>A pricey but worthy trade.</b> Trying to hide their distaste for treating children like goods, your sailors bring the kids onboard. They are in a state of shock but look physically sound.","802183":"The children are safe with you, punish their abductors","802184":"The children will be safer with their parents, let the kidnappers leave","802186":"<b>Your retribution is ruthless.</b> The kidnappers are still counting the goods you bought the children with when the crew attacks, and its assault is brutal. The steamboat is set aflame and all bandits die by fire or bullet. The crew brings the kids back to the safety of their homes, but the children now see them as no different from their captors: beasts driven by violent instincts.","802187":"<b>Your sailors are overpowered.</b> The kidnappers have fought much harder battles against much less men, and your crew's attack is dismissed with scorn. They could easily have retrieved the children, but their strange sense of honor makes them consider that goods bought are goods acquired. The crew is sent back to the village with the kids, both looking equally dishevelled and aghast.","802188":"<b>Pity to let the culprits escape so easily.</b> The sailors bring the children back to their respective families, but the kids' joy fails to hide how many more could have been saved given an extra effort.","802189":"<b>You do not match the bandits' expectations.</b> To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his thumb before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for the penniless. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.","802190":"<b>There's only so much your sailors can do.</b> They back away under the menace of the bandits' guns, doing their best not to trigger an attack, and row back to the coast. The parents of the abducted children thank them for the effort, but their strangled hopes make their voices break. The sailors leave knowing they could have done better.","802191":"<b>A masterful shot!</b> Using one of your precious spiral-muzzled cannons, the crew fires a single shot which pierces straight through the steamboat's engines. The boat gradually stops puffing and drifts to your own ship, where sailors can pluck the bandits and three stolen children.","802192":"<b>Poor use of your firepower.</b> The sailors handling the cannons and the weapons themselves are equally important: not as well-oiled as the machinery, the crew fails to adjust the quantity of powder used, firing the artillery to its maximum range without any kind of aiming. They might as well have lit signal fires. The bandits' boat makes a brutal turn and retreats in the bayou at full speed.","802193":"<b>Both bandits and captives are killed.</b> The villagers watch in horror as your ship fires its cannons at the small steamboat as soon as it is in sight, annihilating the frail vessel and all life onboard. Mothers and fathers rush in the water, screaming and crying as tiny bodies slowly emerge. If your crew had had a greater control over themselves and the ship, maybe they wouldn't have had to bear the weight of these children's deaths.","802194":"Scare the kidnappers into revealing the position of their hideout","802196":"Enough risks for today: return the children and be on your way","802197":"<b>Your seafarers coerce the river-dwellers into saying the truth.</b> There is a world of knowledge and pain into your men's eyes, and the bandits are overwhelmed by their presence before a single word is spoken. The revealed hideout is an easy prey for your crew, which storms through the den and triumphantly bring all children back to their parents, along with the bandits' possessions and supplies.","802198":"<b>The intention is here, but not the result.</b> The bandits recognize your sailors for what they are: sharp-shooters indeed, but weaklings when it comes to close-range confrontation. The crew's threats are nothing to them. Knowing that these men know where the rest of the children are held, your crew hands them to the villagers along with the kids they found, and leave with a feeling of defeat.","802199":"<b>Thoughts of the remaining captives follow your crew.</b> The villagers are thrilled to have the handful of children returned to them and profusely thank their saviors, making their remorse worse with each new praise. The sailors are happy for them but know they could have done more.","802200":"<b>Not all sailors share your lack of compassion.</b> Some men and women refuse to leave and the officers have no choice but to let them do as they please lest they'd lose even more of the crew's trust. Many sailors argue that staying to help was the right choice, but the ship has already set sail when they voice their opinion.","999001":"Backspace","999002":"Tab","999003":"Return","999004":"Shift","999005":"Ctrl","999006":"Alt","999007":"Pause","999008":"CapsLock","999009":"Escape","999010":"Space","999011":"PageUp","999012":"PageDown","999013":"End","999014":"Home","999015":"Left","999016":"Up","999017":"Right","999018":"Down","999019":"PrintScreen","999020":"Insert","999021":"Delete","999022":"0","999023":"1","999024":"2","999025":"3","999026":"4","999027":"5","999028":"6","999029":"7","999030":"8","999031":"9","999032":"A","999033":"B","999034":"C","999035":"D","999036":"E","999037":"F","999038":"G","999039":"H","999040":"I","999041":"J","999042":"K","999043":"L","999044":"M","999045":"N","999046":"O","999047":"P","999048":"Q","999049":"R","999050":"S","999051":"T","999052":"U","999053":"V","999054":"W","999055":"X","999056":"Y","999057":"Z","999058":"Left
